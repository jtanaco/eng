1
00:01:02,046 --> 00:01:04,847
I never once thought that
I wanted to die.

2
00:01:05,516 --> 00:01:07,387
I always wanted to live.

3
00:01:07,957 --> 00:01:11,556
I got this because
I wanted to get noticed.

4
00:01:11,556 --> 00:01:13,496
I didn't even use a knife.

5
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:17,026
I used a plastic ruler
in case it hurt.

6
00:01:19,297 --> 00:01:21,666
That's not the issue right now!

7
00:01:21,666 --> 00:01:23,437
Take some of my blood already!

8
00:01:23,437 --> 00:01:26,136
Just hurry up and take my blood!

9
00:01:34,317 --> 00:01:36,017
You're right.

10
00:01:36,916 --> 00:01:38,146
I'm a patient.

11
00:01:48,396 --> 00:01:49,797
(Episode 9)

12
00:01:54,597 --> 00:01:58,006
There's someone...

13
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:00,737
There's someone I like.

14
00:02:00,907 --> 00:02:02,776
My goodness, congratulations.

15
00:02:03,377 --> 00:02:04,976
I want to ask her out.

16
00:02:05,246 --> 00:02:06,717
But I don't want...

17
00:02:07,746 --> 00:02:10,946
I don't want to shake
my head like this in front of her.

18
00:02:11,246 --> 00:02:12,756
So I want to get better
as fast as I can.

19
00:02:13,756 --> 00:02:15,317
How are you going to ask her out?

20
00:02:15,317 --> 00:02:16,386
Well...

21
00:02:17,527 --> 00:02:19,527
Do you want to hear it?

22
00:02:19,657 --> 00:02:22,497
Sure. Go ahead.

23
00:02:23,397 --> 00:02:24,666
I'm getting nervous.

24
00:02:32,407 --> 00:02:34,076
I won't beat around the bush.

25
00:02:34,407 --> 00:02:35,676
Will you go out with me?

26
00:02:41,946 --> 00:02:44,386
That's it?

27
00:02:44,386 --> 00:02:46,956
What do you think...
What do you think about it?

28
00:02:47,117 --> 00:02:49,587
It's simple and honest.

29
00:02:49,787 --> 00:02:50,956
I think it might work.

30
00:02:50,956 --> 00:02:51,956
Oh, really?

31
00:02:55,867 --> 00:02:56,967
Then...

32
00:02:58,567 --> 00:03:00,097
Then it's your turn to answer.

33
00:03:00,567 --> 00:03:01,837
Hurry.

34
00:03:08,337 --> 00:03:11,006
Okay, fine. I'll give you some time.

35
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:21,717
- Go home safely.
- Okay, bye.

36
00:03:28,157 --> 00:03:29,196
Si Joon.

37
00:03:34,337 --> 00:03:36,337
Why did you ask me
to treat Han Woo Joo?

38
00:03:37,266 --> 00:03:39,277
You knew from the start, didn't you?

39
00:03:41,537 --> 00:03:42,647
Why did you do that?

40
00:03:42,676 --> 00:03:45,046
Because I couldn't stand
seeing you live like this.

41
00:03:45,046 --> 00:03:46,147
What's wrong with how I live?

42
00:03:46,147 --> 00:03:49,087
You don't care about yourself.
You only care about your patients.

43
00:03:50,117 --> 00:03:53,516
You always work so hard because of
what happened eight years ago.

44
00:03:56,057 --> 00:03:57,627
I sent Woo Joo to you...

45
00:03:58,226 --> 00:04:00,756
because I had
diagnosed you with PTSD,

46
00:04:00,756 --> 00:04:02,796
and I thought she might be
your way to heal.

47
00:04:05,266 --> 00:04:07,867
Who gave you the right
to give me a prescription?

48
00:04:07,867 --> 00:04:10,266
I just want you to overcome
what happened as fast as possible.

49
00:04:10,266 --> 00:04:11,337
But why...

50
00:04:15,576 --> 00:04:16,606
Why would you do that?

51
00:04:19,016 --> 00:04:21,347
Yes, you're right.

52
00:04:22,347 --> 00:04:23,787
I have PTSD.

53
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:26,287
What happened eight years ago...

54
00:04:27,116 --> 00:04:29,126
is still very traumatic to me.

55
00:05:04,527 --> 00:05:05,926
Every time I see a patient with
a borderline personality disorder,

56
00:05:06,657 --> 00:05:08,157
it reminds me of what happened
that day.

57
00:05:09,967 --> 00:05:11,496
And it makes me want to avoid them.

58
00:05:11,496 --> 00:05:12,897
You can't avoid them forever.

59
00:05:13,967 --> 00:05:16,267
You're just punishing yourself.

60
00:05:16,306 --> 00:05:18,106
You have no plans to treat yourself.

61
00:05:18,106 --> 00:05:19,137
Han Woo Joo...

62
00:05:20,736 --> 00:05:22,347
was your patient to begin with.

63
00:05:23,207 --> 00:05:24,546
So take her back.

64
00:05:26,116 --> 00:05:28,046
Now that I know she's borderline,

65
00:05:30,147 --> 00:05:31,986
I can't treat her.

66
00:05:34,186 --> 00:05:35,387
Are you a doctor?

67
00:05:36,426 --> 00:05:37,787
Are you a psychiatrist?

68
00:05:37,986 --> 00:05:39,556
A borderline patient...

69
00:05:41,657 --> 00:05:43,267
stabbed me in the back.

70
00:05:44,726 --> 00:05:45,837
One such incident...

71
00:05:46,866 --> 00:05:48,197
is more than enough.

72
00:05:48,967 --> 00:05:51,106
If you reject Woo Joo now,
you're not a doctor.

73
00:05:51,106 --> 00:05:53,936
You're less than a human
and I won't see you again.

74
00:06:38,546 --> 00:06:39,856
Am I pretty?

75
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:41,657
What? What did you say?

76
00:07:39,316 --> 00:07:40,416
You witch.

77
00:07:41,546 --> 00:07:42,686
You cruel witch.

78
00:07:43,616 --> 00:07:45,287
You were the worst.

79
00:07:49,757 --> 00:07:52,726
That day, you killed me as well.

80
00:07:56,296 --> 00:07:59,666
And he just drove off.
I couldn't believe it.

81
00:08:00,337 --> 00:08:03,666
Hey. How can someone
change so suddenly?

82
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:05,907
Dr. Lee should feel the worst today.

83
00:08:06,007 --> 00:08:07,306
I think that's why.

84
00:08:07,306 --> 00:08:09,947
Dr. Park punished him.
He can't see outpatients.

85
00:08:10,847 --> 00:08:13,176
Does that mean
he can't treat anyone?

86
00:08:13,176 --> 00:08:15,476
He's a total workaholic.

87
00:08:15,476 --> 00:08:18,017
He'll feel like
the sky caved in on him.

88
00:08:18,486 --> 00:08:20,856
Is it because of that?
The search and seizure?

89
00:08:21,056 --> 00:08:22,257
Yes.

90
00:08:22,257 --> 00:08:25,327
Who on earth
tipped off the prosecutors?

91
00:08:34,697 --> 00:08:38,507
Woo Joo. Do you remember
the anorexia patient...

92
00:08:38,507 --> 00:08:40,107
who was in stage therapy?

93
00:08:40,107 --> 00:08:41,507
- Hwang Bo Young.
- Yes.

94
00:08:41,706 --> 00:08:44,747
She gave up treatment.

95
00:08:45,806 --> 00:08:47,046
Because of me?

96
00:08:48,477 --> 00:08:51,287
- Because of what I said?
- It's not your fault.

97
00:08:52,487 --> 00:08:54,757
But it's true that
it caused Dr. Lee some trouble.

98
00:08:55,556 --> 00:08:58,586
Dr. Lee's suffering with
many things right now.

99
00:08:59,027 --> 00:09:00,296
You need to understand.

100
00:09:01,257 --> 00:09:02,527
It's my fault.

101
00:09:03,527 --> 00:09:05,196
I was the problem.

102
00:09:05,867 --> 00:09:07,436
I had no idea.

103
00:09:09,737 --> 00:09:11,206
I feel so bad now.

104
00:09:13,777 --> 00:09:14,877
My gosh.

105
00:09:16,747 --> 00:09:17,806
Woo Joo.

106
00:09:19,147 --> 00:09:21,076
How does it feel to dupe...

107
00:09:21,076 --> 00:09:22,987
a naive doctor to get a drink?

108
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:24,846
I bet you feel great.

109
00:09:24,846 --> 00:09:27,117
While we all are down in the dumps.

110
00:09:29,086 --> 00:09:31,826
Lady. Why do you nag so much?

111
00:09:36,027 --> 00:09:38,296
- Just get changed.
- I'm getting discharged.

112
00:09:38,296 --> 00:09:39,296
Just like that?

113
00:09:39,296 --> 00:09:42,196
Don't think of trying to
keep me here by force.

114
00:09:42,607 --> 00:09:44,436
If you do that,

115
00:09:46,206 --> 00:09:48,637
you'll get searched
and seized all over.

116
00:09:52,277 --> 00:09:53,346
Fine.

117
00:09:53,346 --> 00:09:56,287
If you want to get discharged,
then we'll have to let you go.

118
00:09:56,517 --> 00:09:58,787
But only once you're sober.

119
00:09:59,357 --> 00:10:02,186
You're not leaving today,
so get changed.

120
00:10:02,186 --> 00:10:03,487
Darn it.

121
00:10:04,487 --> 00:10:07,227
I can't change until you leave.

122
00:10:20,007 --> 00:10:22,846
How dare you? I knew it.

123
00:10:23,277 --> 00:10:26,176
Give it back. It's mine. It's mine.

124
00:10:26,546 --> 00:10:28,777
It's mine! It's mine!

125
00:10:29,046 --> 00:10:30,987
Give it back. Give it back!

126
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:34,787
- Give it back.
- Nurse Oh.

127
00:10:34,787 --> 00:10:36,657
Give it back to me.

128
00:10:36,657 --> 00:10:38,887
- Come here.
- Let go. Let go of me.

129
00:10:38,887 --> 00:10:40,296
- Let go!
- What's wrong?

130
00:10:40,296 --> 00:10:45,227
I'll report you to
the Human Rights Commission!

131
00:10:48,966 --> 00:10:51,436
The receiver cannot be reached.
You will be...

132
00:10:52,336 --> 00:10:53,907
I can't reach Dr. Lee.

133
00:10:56,306 --> 00:10:59,546
You can decide whether to
send Ms. Kim home or not.

134
00:10:59,546 --> 00:11:02,046
- She's your patient.
- That is true, but...

135
00:11:04,647 --> 00:11:07,357
Is it the right thing
to discharge her right now?

136
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:10,887
I'd like to hear
what Dr. Lee thinks.

137
00:11:11,627 --> 00:11:13,596
She was his patient at first.

138
00:11:13,596 --> 00:11:15,696
Like she said, she walked in...

139
00:11:15,696 --> 00:11:17,397
and asked to be admitted.

140
00:11:17,397 --> 00:11:20,367
If she wants to leave,
we have no choice but to let her.

141
00:11:20,367 --> 00:11:22,497
We can't keep her a day longer.

142
00:11:22,497 --> 00:11:24,836
She's threatening to report us...

143
00:11:24,836 --> 00:11:26,507
to the Human Rights Commission.

144
00:11:34,747 --> 00:11:37,487
Why are you so deep in thought?
Just call him.

145
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:39,586
He might not pick up.

146
00:11:39,586 --> 00:11:41,887
He might not if he's too busy.

147
00:11:42,056 --> 00:11:43,657
He seemed very angry.

148
00:11:43,657 --> 00:11:45,826
With you? Really?

149
00:11:46,357 --> 00:11:49,767
Hey. He's not that small-minded.

150
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:53,836
I really wanted
to get along with Dr. Lee.

151
00:11:56,267 --> 00:11:58,706
Am I the type that
men get sick of easily?

152
00:11:58,836 --> 00:12:01,407
He's not a man. He's a doctor.

153
00:12:03,076 --> 00:12:05,046
Do you have an ulterior motive?

154
00:12:05,046 --> 00:12:06,216
Like what?

155
00:12:07,446 --> 00:12:08,477
I mean...

156
00:12:09,716 --> 00:12:11,716
You do seem a bit too concerned.

157
00:12:13,456 --> 00:12:14,657
He's not my type.

158
00:12:14,657 --> 00:12:16,426
You fall for anyone so quickly.

159
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:25,296
Hey. Who's that woman?

160
00:12:28,196 --> 00:12:29,907
What is she doing
outside my restaurant?

161
00:12:30,436 --> 00:12:32,877
- She's one of the patients.
- What patient?

162
00:12:34,107 --> 00:12:36,247
It's obvious she had a drink.

163
00:12:36,977 --> 00:12:38,107
She's an alcoholic.

164
00:12:58,497 --> 00:13:00,966
- One more?
- She said she knows...

165
00:13:00,966 --> 00:13:02,936
who reported Dr. Lee
and bargained for a drink.

166
00:13:03,806 --> 00:13:05,436
And Woo Joo took the bait.

167
00:13:07,377 --> 00:13:08,936
She said she got discharged today.

168
00:13:08,936 --> 00:13:10,507
Is she allowed to drink?

169
00:13:11,046 --> 00:13:12,747
This is just unbelievable.

170
00:13:12,747 --> 00:13:14,816
Take the bottle
away from her right now!

171
00:13:15,247 --> 00:13:17,186
What got into Woo Joo as well?

172
00:13:17,186 --> 00:13:18,987
This could cause a huge problem.

173
00:13:23,056 --> 00:13:24,157
- Hey.
- What?

174
00:13:24,157 --> 00:13:26,196
Do you really know
who reported Dr. Lee?

175
00:13:26,727 --> 00:13:28,657
You said you'd tell after one drink,

176
00:13:28,657 --> 00:13:30,166
and you had a lot.

177
00:13:31,596 --> 00:13:32,727
The culprit...

178
00:13:36,037 --> 00:13:37,466
is within the hospital.

179
00:13:37,466 --> 00:13:39,836
- It was a patient.
- A doctor.

180
00:13:40,877 --> 00:13:43,076
- Really?
- My glass is empty.

181
00:13:43,977 --> 00:13:45,706
You should go now.

182
00:13:46,107 --> 00:13:48,446
You can't do this
the day you got discharged.

183
00:13:48,747 --> 00:13:50,216
- You stop as well.
- Hey.

184
00:13:50,816 --> 00:13:52,247
A doctor tipped them off.

185
00:13:53,387 --> 00:13:54,787
- Which doctor?
- Hey.

186
00:13:54,987 --> 00:13:56,987
She put on a show
to get a free drink.

187
00:13:57,456 --> 00:13:59,257
Where do you live?
I'll call you a taxi.

188
00:13:59,257 --> 00:14:00,556
I don't live anywhere.

189
00:14:00,556 --> 00:14:03,027
Will you go back to the hospital?
Shall I call them?

190
00:14:04,696 --> 00:14:06,196
Are you belittling me?

191
00:14:06,696 --> 00:14:09,607
Why would I go back there?

192
00:14:12,367 --> 00:14:16,107
If you want to know the tipster,
bring me more alcohol.

193
00:14:16,446 --> 00:14:18,806
No. You could get into trouble.

194
00:14:18,806 --> 00:14:20,877
No more drinks
until you give me a name.

195
00:14:20,877 --> 00:14:22,747
I'll get soju myself then.

196
00:14:23,216 --> 00:14:24,647
I'll get it myself.

197
00:14:24,647 --> 00:14:26,517
I'll go and get...

198
00:14:35,826 --> 00:14:36,897
Hey.

199
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:39,637
You can't fall asleep here.

200
00:14:39,637 --> 00:14:42,367
Who called the prosecutor? Tell me.

201
00:14:42,907 --> 00:14:44,166
Get up.

202
00:14:45,936 --> 00:14:48,037
Oh, no. What happened?

203
00:14:48,037 --> 00:14:49,706
- Hey.
- Check her.

204
00:14:50,147 --> 00:14:51,277
Oh, dear.

205
00:14:51,946 --> 00:14:53,846
She's not breathing!

206
00:14:54,576 --> 00:14:55,647
What?

207
00:14:56,787 --> 00:14:59,316
Hey. Hey.

208
00:15:08,727 --> 00:15:10,997
- Hello?
- Si Joon.

209
00:15:35,257 --> 00:15:36,357
Cut.

210
00:15:40,027 --> 00:15:41,027
Cut.

211
00:16:00,247 --> 00:16:01,416
Cut.

212
00:16:05,716 --> 00:16:08,757
It's a great day to save lives.

213
00:16:17,296 --> 00:16:18,296
Cut.

214
00:16:22,867 --> 00:16:24,137
Cut.

215
00:16:28,336 --> 00:16:30,607
Hey, you're the new guy.

216
00:16:37,316 --> 00:16:39,117
Are you getting ready for surgery?

217
00:16:39,147 --> 00:16:41,456
You're very quick-witted.

218
00:16:41,716 --> 00:16:44,056
Yes, I'll let you join this time.

219
00:16:44,186 --> 00:16:46,757
I need to do a liver transplant
and a proctocolectomy.

220
00:16:46,796 --> 00:16:49,497
It's going to be
the best surgery of the century.

221
00:16:51,426 --> 00:16:52,527
I'm honored, sir.

222
00:16:53,436 --> 00:16:54,497
When is the surgery?

223
00:16:54,497 --> 00:16:55,497
Tomorrow.

224
00:16:57,407 --> 00:17:00,206
The surgery will take place
at a hospital in Seoul.

225
00:17:00,806 --> 00:17:03,946
Okay? My son works at that hospital.

226
00:17:08,977 --> 00:17:09,987
Then...

227
00:17:11,517 --> 00:17:13,217
I guess you'll get to meet your son.

228
00:17:13,217 --> 00:17:15,187
Why would I meet that punk?

229
00:17:15,556 --> 00:17:18,886
Why not?
You just said he works there.

230
00:17:20,326 --> 00:17:21,957
I told you he's dumb.

231
00:17:23,566 --> 00:17:25,697
We're like water and oil.

232
00:17:29,767 --> 00:17:31,136
That's just like me and my dad.

233
00:17:32,406 --> 00:17:34,677
My dad and I are also like
water and oil.

234
00:17:35,777 --> 00:17:36,806
How did that happen?

235
00:17:39,247 --> 00:17:41,177
I can't seem to talk to my dad.

236
00:17:42,977 --> 00:17:45,187
He's very stubborn and audacious.

237
00:17:45,187 --> 00:17:47,217
He thinks he's the smartest person
in the world.

238
00:17:47,517 --> 00:17:50,886
I totally understand
why my mom ran away.

239
00:17:56,356 --> 00:18:00,167
My dad didn't know how to smile.

240
00:18:02,796 --> 00:18:05,066
All I remember...

241
00:18:07,076 --> 00:18:08,836
is that he used to beat me.

242
00:18:10,177 --> 00:18:11,906
Do you know what I did...

243
00:18:12,346 --> 00:18:16,247
to ease the pain
every time I got beaten up by him?

244
00:18:17,447 --> 00:18:19,717
I objectified him.

245
00:18:19,917 --> 00:18:22,386
"Who is this person
that's hitting me right now?"

246
00:18:22,386 --> 00:18:24,757
"What kind of life has he lived?"

247
00:18:25,527 --> 00:18:27,796
"I wonder what's on his mind
as he beats up his own son."

248
00:18:36,537 --> 00:18:37,707
All I got...

249
00:18:40,507 --> 00:18:42,707
from my father...

250
00:18:43,277 --> 00:18:44,806
was poverty.

251
00:18:46,616 --> 00:18:50,917
I didn't want to pass that on
to my own son.

252
00:18:52,546 --> 00:18:55,287
The biggest wealth
I could give him...

253
00:18:56,556 --> 00:19:00,096
was my medical knowledge.

254
00:19:02,227 --> 00:19:05,396
That's why I wanted you to become
a surgeon like me.

255
00:19:12,437 --> 00:19:13,477
Do you...

256
00:19:14,906 --> 00:19:16,306
remember everything?

257
00:19:16,306 --> 00:19:17,576
You pathetic punk.

258
00:19:19,207 --> 00:19:22,546
Why are you still
holding onto the past?

259
00:19:25,316 --> 00:19:26,346
Dad.

260
00:19:29,386 --> 00:19:30,457
Doctor.

261
00:19:30,457 --> 00:19:32,727
My princess.

262
00:19:32,727 --> 00:19:34,527
You've never met her before,
have you?

263
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:36,296
He's a resident.

264
00:19:37,027 --> 00:19:39,096
What are you still doing here?
You're so slow-witted.

265
00:19:39,096 --> 00:19:41,066
Get out of here.

266
00:19:41,066 --> 00:19:43,467
Go. Go on.

267
00:19:43,767 --> 00:19:46,267
Get going already. Go.

268
00:19:46,267 --> 00:19:47,777
There you go.

269
00:19:49,977 --> 00:19:51,507
Catch this.

270
00:19:54,277 --> 00:19:55,316
Here you go.

271
00:19:56,247 --> 00:19:58,287
I've never seen my dad
smile like that.

272
00:19:58,287 --> 00:20:00,816
His affection for her
is helping a lot.

273
00:20:01,156 --> 00:20:04,356
He doesn't shout
as much as he used to.

274
00:20:05,187 --> 00:20:09,197
My dad wandered
numerous times today.

275
00:20:09,197 --> 00:20:10,396
(Wandering: A common state
among patients with dementia)

276
00:20:10,396 --> 00:20:13,167
It happens to him often these days.

277
00:20:13,497 --> 00:20:15,967
As you already know,
people with dementia...

278
00:20:16,366 --> 00:20:20,136
sometimes regain their memories
from time to time.

279
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:28,917
Here you go.

280
00:20:29,376 --> 00:20:30,417
My goodness.

281
00:20:34,556 --> 00:20:36,017
Thank you.

282
00:20:49,296 --> 00:20:50,437
Are you leaving?

283
00:20:51,366 --> 00:20:52,366
Yes.

284
00:20:52,366 --> 00:20:54,737
You should go
and get ready for surgery.

285
00:20:54,737 --> 00:20:57,007
I'll be right there, okay?

286
00:21:00,917 --> 00:21:02,447
Okay, sir.

287
00:21:02,717 --> 00:21:06,146
By the way, drive safely at night.

288
00:21:06,447 --> 00:21:07,457
Okay.

289
00:21:07,457 --> 00:21:08,556
Oh, right.

290
00:21:09,717 --> 00:21:11,156
Is he doing okay?

291
00:21:12,156 --> 00:21:13,927
- Who?
- The kid.

292
00:21:14,997 --> 00:21:15,997
What?

293
00:21:16,326 --> 00:21:17,566
Park Luo.

294
00:21:20,796 --> 00:21:24,336
If you fail to answer me in the OR,
I'll have you kicked out.

295
00:21:25,507 --> 00:21:26,606
You darn punk.

296
00:21:42,017 --> 00:21:43,527
- Hello?
- Where are you, sir?

297
00:21:43,527 --> 00:21:45,227
We urgently need you
at the hospital.

298
00:21:45,227 --> 00:21:46,727
Why? Did something happen?

299
00:21:47,227 --> 00:21:49,527
Ms. Kim, the alcoholic,

300
00:21:49,527 --> 00:21:51,197
got discharged this afternoon.

301
00:21:51,527 --> 00:21:54,136
But she just got brought in again
due to acute alcohol intoxication.

302
00:21:55,336 --> 00:21:57,237
- How is her condition?
- The level of alcohol...

303
00:21:57,237 --> 00:21:59,207
in her blood is 0.3 percent.
She's in a dangerous state.

304
00:21:59,207 --> 00:22:00,207
What?

305
00:22:00,876 --> 00:22:03,677
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have let her leave.

306
00:22:16,556 --> 00:22:19,227
Gosh, why did I give her alcohol?

307
00:22:19,427 --> 00:22:21,697
What is wrong with me?

308
00:22:24,126 --> 00:22:25,197
(Emergency Medical Center)

309
00:22:35,507 --> 00:22:38,007
She binge drank
when she had alcoholic hepatitis,

310
00:22:38,007 --> 00:22:39,906
and that's what caused
the acute alcohol intoxication.

311
00:22:39,906 --> 00:22:42,116
We did a blood test
and took an abdominal ultrasound.

312
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:45,086
We injected her with dextrose
so her alcohol level will go down.

313
00:22:45,717 --> 00:22:47,017
Is she conscious?

314
00:22:47,017 --> 00:22:48,056
Yes.

315
00:22:49,616 --> 00:22:51,727
I heard she didn't drink
for six months.

316
00:22:52,527 --> 00:22:54,626
Gosh, she should've tried harder
not to drink.

317
00:22:55,126 --> 00:22:58,667
Alcoholics need more than just
patience to treat their addiction.

318
00:23:46,876 --> 00:23:48,977
Alcoholic hepatitis got worse,

319
00:23:48,977 --> 00:23:51,086
so she got sent
to Internal Medicine for now.

320
00:23:51,917 --> 00:23:54,217
Why did you let her get discharged?

321
00:23:54,217 --> 00:23:57,487
I took her out for a while,
and that's when she drank.

322
00:23:58,027 --> 00:23:59,227
I'm sorry, sir.

323
00:24:00,027 --> 00:24:01,727
She got hospitalized
because she wanted to,

324
00:24:01,727 --> 00:24:04,427
and she was eager to get discharged,
so we couldn't make her stay.

325
00:24:04,427 --> 00:24:06,596
Have her hospitalized once she
comes back from Internal Medicine.

326
00:24:06,596 --> 00:24:07,667
Okay, sir.

327
00:24:07,697 --> 00:24:09,596
We'll detoxify her
and prescribe her medicine...

328
00:24:09,596 --> 00:24:11,007
as soon as she gets hospitalized.

329
00:24:11,106 --> 00:24:14,606
But I feel like she might not
want to get hospitalized.

330
00:24:14,606 --> 00:24:16,136
Then call her guardian.

331
00:24:16,806 --> 00:24:18,406
Dr. Lee.

332
00:24:18,906 --> 00:24:21,046
Ms. Kim doesn't have a guardian.

333
00:24:21,346 --> 00:24:24,846
She cut ties with her family
after she became an alcoholic.

334
00:24:25,886 --> 00:24:27,457
I think...

335
00:24:27,717 --> 00:24:29,987
we should just
let her get discharged...

336
00:24:29,987 --> 00:24:32,727
and have her hospitalized
the next time she comes back.

337
00:24:32,826 --> 00:24:37,366
Alcoholics drink until their bodies
completely get ruined.

338
00:24:38,296 --> 00:24:40,967
How did she end up in the ER?
I thought her family brought her.

339
00:24:40,967 --> 00:24:43,866
Ms. Han Woo Joo brought her here.

340
00:24:43,866 --> 00:24:45,007
What? How?

341
00:24:45,007 --> 00:24:47,277
They drank together,
and that's when she collapsed.

342
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:48,336
What?

343
00:24:48,606 --> 00:24:51,207
Ms. Han is a huge troublemaker.

344
00:24:51,207 --> 00:24:55,447
Ms. Hwang refused to get treated
because of her.

345
00:24:55,447 --> 00:24:57,346
That's not true.

346
00:24:57,346 --> 00:25:00,316
It's not Woo Joo's fault
that she refused to get treated.

347
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:03,727
Plus, Ms. Kim wouldn't have drunk
if I didn't take her outside.

348
00:25:03,727 --> 00:25:05,156
She came here
due to acute alcohol intoxication...

349
00:25:05,156 --> 00:25:06,997
because she drank alcohol
with Ms. Han.

350
00:25:06,997 --> 00:25:09,727
It's not like
she forced her to drink.

351
00:25:09,727 --> 00:25:11,027
What are you doing...

352
00:25:11,596 --> 00:25:12,767
in front of Dr. Lee?

353
00:25:14,197 --> 00:25:16,197
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

354
00:25:16,267 --> 00:25:18,767
Why did you stop them?
Go ahead. Keep fighting.

355
00:25:19,366 --> 00:25:20,537
I'm sorry, sir.

356
00:25:34,687 --> 00:25:37,287
Thanks for Luo's files.
They helped a lot.

357
00:25:37,386 --> 00:25:38,727
There's no need to thank me.

358
00:25:38,727 --> 00:25:40,197
I'm going to start
with counseling...

359
00:25:40,356 --> 00:25:42,257
so that Luo doesn't feel
too uncomfortable.

360
00:25:42,527 --> 00:25:43,596
Okay.

361
00:25:43,596 --> 00:25:45,667
He's your patient,
so that's up to you.

362
00:25:46,767 --> 00:25:48,096
I heard you met Young Won.

363
00:25:49,697 --> 00:25:50,967
She's really worried about you.

364
00:25:54,537 --> 00:25:57,546
Did you also know about Woo Joo?

365
00:25:57,747 --> 00:25:59,146
Yes, I did.

366
00:26:00,277 --> 00:26:02,747
So what? Are you
going to get angry at me again?

367
00:26:03,747 --> 00:26:05,586
I can't believe you're my friend.

368
00:26:06,346 --> 00:26:08,987
Do you not care at all
about Young Won?

369
00:26:15,927 --> 00:26:18,027
Do you think I pretended not to know
for your sake?

370
00:26:18,826 --> 00:26:20,737
I only did it for Young Won.

371
00:26:21,836 --> 00:26:23,866
I should've stopped her.

372
00:26:25,806 --> 00:26:28,277
You really should know
how much she cares.

373
00:26:29,406 --> 00:26:31,806
Why do you think she chose
to do that to you?

374
00:26:43,517 --> 00:26:45,126
(Han Woo Joo)

375
00:26:47,056 --> 00:26:48,257
(Han Woo Joo)

376
00:26:48,257 --> 00:26:49,826
(You have 4 missed calls.)

377
00:26:58,336 --> 00:27:00,806
He's ignoring
all my calls and texts.

378
00:27:01,277 --> 00:27:02,737
He must be really angry.

379
00:27:03,977 --> 00:27:06,646
Fine. I'll just ignore you, too.

380
00:27:17,187 --> 00:27:18,287
Woo Joo.

381
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:26,697
He just...

382
00:27:27,697 --> 00:27:33,106
called my name.

383
00:27:46,487 --> 00:27:50,056
You knew Ms. Kim
was an alcoholic, right?

384
00:27:52,757 --> 00:27:54,796
I met her
in the stage therapy class.

385
00:27:55,927 --> 00:27:57,396
She could've died.

386
00:27:58,066 --> 00:28:00,396
She had been clean for a while,
but she suddenly binge drank.

387
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:02,537
She collapsed
due to acute alcohol intoxication...

388
00:28:02,896 --> 00:28:04,306
and could've died.

389
00:28:05,306 --> 00:28:07,806
- My gosh...
- You knew she was an alcoholic.

390
00:28:08,677 --> 00:28:10,207
So why did you drink with her?

391
00:28:12,076 --> 00:28:13,207
Well...

392
00:28:14,046 --> 00:28:16,116
She had gotten discharged.

393
00:28:16,116 --> 00:28:17,517
And she was already drunk.

394
00:28:20,386 --> 00:28:21,856
Is it my fault that she drank?

395
00:28:21,856 --> 00:28:24,987
- I heard you drank with her.
- Well, yes.

396
00:28:25,386 --> 00:28:27,826
But I didn't force her to drink.

397
00:28:29,257 --> 00:28:31,427
I gave her a few shots
because she promised to tell me...

398
00:28:31,427 --> 00:28:32,896
who the tipster is.

399
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:35,937
Why do you have to care so much?

400
00:28:36,796 --> 00:28:38,267
Why do I have to care?

401
00:28:40,336 --> 00:28:42,836
Yes, you're right. I'm very nosy.

402
00:28:42,836 --> 00:28:44,876
You should've stopped her
from drinking if you knew...

403
00:28:44,876 --> 00:28:46,277
she was hospitalized
for being an alcoholic.

404
00:28:46,277 --> 00:28:49,417
You talk as if I poured alcohol
into her mouth!

405
00:28:49,417 --> 00:28:51,316
You talk as if it's my fault
that she collapsed!

406
00:28:52,217 --> 00:28:53,717
From now on,

407
00:28:55,356 --> 00:28:56,886
I don't want you
to meet my patients.

408
00:28:58,527 --> 00:29:01,056
Gosh, this is very upsetting.

409
00:29:02,356 --> 00:29:04,566
You talk as if I only cause damage
to your patients.

410
00:29:09,697 --> 00:29:11,707
I guess
that's what you really think.

411
00:29:12,636 --> 00:29:14,636
Is that why you ignored my calls?

412
00:29:16,507 --> 00:29:19,106
She would've gotten drunk
even if it weren't for me.

413
00:29:19,406 --> 00:29:22,816
I just wanted to help you.

414
00:29:23,277 --> 00:29:25,947
I just wanted to know
the tipster's name.

415
00:29:28,957 --> 00:29:29,987
We should go.

416
00:29:30,826 --> 00:29:32,487
I'll just quit stage therapy.

417
00:29:32,927 --> 00:29:34,427
All I do is cause damage
to the patients,

418
00:29:34,427 --> 00:29:36,997
so I have no right to do
stage therapy!

419
00:29:37,626 --> 00:29:39,267
I'll quit!
That will solve everything!

420
00:29:39,267 --> 00:29:40,326
Okay then.

421
00:29:43,197 --> 00:29:45,007
I think that will be best
for both of us.

422
00:30:08,727 --> 00:30:10,427
I think that will be best
for both of us.

423
00:30:18,237 --> 00:30:21,237
Darn you, you son of a gun!

424
00:30:27,447 --> 00:30:29,477
How could he say that?

425
00:30:29,977 --> 00:30:32,816
Does he not know
that I didn't mean it?

426
00:30:33,316 --> 00:30:35,316
I only said that
because I felt sorry.

427
00:30:35,316 --> 00:30:37,457
He could've just
patted me on the back...

428
00:30:37,856 --> 00:30:40,187
and told me that it wasn't my fault.

429
00:30:40,187 --> 00:30:42,156
Isn't that what a psychiatrist
should do?

430
00:30:43,156 --> 00:30:44,767
He's not in his right mind, is he?

431
00:30:45,296 --> 00:30:47,296
What do you think?
Do you agree with me?

432
00:30:48,136 --> 00:30:50,836
It looks like you're not
in your right mind.

433
00:30:52,836 --> 00:30:54,737
What should I do with him?

434
00:30:54,977 --> 00:30:56,406
How can I get revenge?

435
00:30:56,477 --> 00:30:58,146
Should I report him
to the Human Rights Commission?

436
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:02,376
Wouldn't they consider this
as mental abuse?

437
00:31:12,487 --> 00:31:14,257
Do you think
I shouldn't have done that?

438
00:31:15,527 --> 00:31:18,066
You did nothing wrong.
Stop being so hard on yourself.

439
00:31:18,267 --> 00:31:20,967
You just did your job
as a doctor and a friend.

440
00:31:21,896 --> 00:31:24,267
But Si Joon was pretty stern.

441
00:31:24,406 --> 00:31:27,237
Young Won, stop worrying so much
about Si Joon.

442
00:31:28,777 --> 00:31:29,906
Just give up on him.

443
00:31:29,906 --> 00:31:31,947
Do you know what I said to him?

444
00:31:32,806 --> 00:31:34,747
I told him that a bad doctor
is a doctor who gives up...

445
00:31:34,747 --> 00:31:36,277
not someone who's incompetent.

446
00:31:38,846 --> 00:31:41,257
I won't give up
either on Si Joon or Ms. Han.

447
00:31:42,386 --> 00:31:45,086
Then I guess I shouldn't
give up on you either.

448
00:31:46,757 --> 00:31:47,856
What?

449
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:52,497
It was a joke.

450
00:31:53,896 --> 00:31:55,096
Eat up. It's delicious.

451
00:32:20,056 --> 00:32:23,227
If there's someone you want
to cuss out, don't hold it in...

452
00:32:23,227 --> 00:32:24,366
and scream into this bag.

453
00:32:26,667 --> 00:32:29,167
Don't become a bad doctor
who gives up...

454
00:32:29,167 --> 00:32:30,767
when it gets too hard to handle me.

455
00:32:42,926 --> 00:32:44,327
(Episode 10)

456
00:33:04,577 --> 00:33:05,976
Why are you here at this hour?

457
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:07,846
I have a favor to ask.

458
00:33:07,846 --> 00:33:09,787
- Come in and have some tea.
- No.

459
00:33:09,987 --> 00:33:11,246
It won't take long.

460
00:33:15,786 --> 00:33:19,426
Woo Joo said
she'll quit stage therapy.

461
00:33:20,096 --> 00:33:21,966
There was an altercation
with another patient.

462
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:25,066
I knew she didn't want to,

463
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:26,896
but I let her quit,

464
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:28,937
without even a moment's hesitation.

465
00:33:28,966 --> 00:33:31,307
- What?
- She brought it up first,

466
00:33:32,307 --> 00:33:33,636
and I felt so grateful.

467
00:33:36,407 --> 00:33:37,947
You really are the worst.

468
00:33:37,947 --> 00:33:39,547
It'll be hard on her.

469
00:33:40,776 --> 00:33:43,646
She's a typical borderline case
who self-harms to get attention.

470
00:33:44,047 --> 00:33:45,656
She wanted me to notice her,

471
00:33:47,016 --> 00:33:48,587
so she jumped out
in front of my car.

472
00:33:50,326 --> 00:33:52,097
Just like Jeong Se Yeon...

473
00:33:52,826 --> 00:33:55,266
who jumped into the water
so I'd never forget her.

474
00:33:56,867 --> 00:33:58,126
They're just the same.

475
00:34:03,906 --> 00:34:05,707
I'm so afraid...

476
00:34:08,507 --> 00:34:09,847
that it might happen again.

477
00:34:10,207 --> 00:34:13,317
The only way for someone
who has almost drowned...

478
00:34:13,317 --> 00:34:15,317
to overcome their fear of water
is to jump back in the water.

479
00:34:15,516 --> 00:34:17,347
You should know well as a doctor.

480
00:34:20,257 --> 00:34:22,087
I don't think I'm ready yet.

481
00:34:23,356 --> 00:34:27,097
Young Won, you should go
and meet Woo Joo.

482
00:34:27,356 --> 00:34:28,597
Don't wait until she comes to you.

483
00:34:28,597 --> 00:34:31,766
Go meet her and treat her.

484
00:34:34,167 --> 00:34:36,007
I promised her...

485
00:34:39,106 --> 00:34:40,537
that I would never give up.

486
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:44,007
Please do me this favor.

487
00:34:44,007 --> 00:34:45,876
I'll do it my way, as I please.

488
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:47,546
Can I?

489
00:35:34,657 --> 00:35:36,527
Rage, go away.

490
00:35:39,167 --> 00:35:41,037
Rage, go away.

491
00:35:47,806 --> 00:35:49,477
According to the CCTV footage,

492
00:35:49,477 --> 00:35:52,277
we've confirmed the patient
wasn't assaulted.

493
00:35:52,277 --> 00:35:54,616
But the problem is, regarding
his emergency hospitalization,

494
00:35:54,616 --> 00:35:57,516
you held him at the hospital against
his will for more than three days...

495
00:35:57,516 --> 00:35:59,586
without his guardian's consent.

496
00:35:59,757 --> 00:36:02,257
This is a violation
of the Mental Health Act.

497
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:04,456
I don't have to explain further,
do I?

498
00:36:05,157 --> 00:36:06,197
I know.

499
00:36:06,456 --> 00:36:08,396
I admit to everything
you've just said.

500
00:36:08,527 --> 00:36:10,967
Once we forward our investigation
to the prosecution,

501
00:36:10,967 --> 00:36:12,396
they will make a decision soon.

502
00:36:13,366 --> 00:36:14,967
You will probably receive
an extenuation...

503
00:36:14,967 --> 00:36:17,437
and this will end as
a summary order.

504
00:36:17,907 --> 00:36:19,336
But you need to be cautious
from now on.

505
00:36:19,437 --> 00:36:23,007
If this problem arises again,
it won't end with a summary order.

506
00:36:23,576 --> 00:36:25,176
Yes, I understand.

507
00:36:26,546 --> 00:36:29,747
But don't you want to know
who reported you?

508
00:36:29,986 --> 00:36:31,386
Everyone asked that first.

509
00:36:32,616 --> 00:36:34,386
It's probably someone who hates me.

510
00:36:34,856 --> 00:36:36,227
According to that person,

511
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:39,527
you were the one who came clean
in the first place.

512
00:36:40,697 --> 00:36:41,997
- Me?
- Yes.

513
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:46,997
Think carefully about
who you told the truth to.

514
00:36:56,447 --> 00:36:58,777
Who did I tell the truth to?

515
00:37:27,707 --> 00:37:28,746
Luo.

516
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:30,707
I know it might be awkward...

517
00:37:30,707 --> 00:37:32,847
since this isn't the room
you always came to.

518
00:37:33,616 --> 00:37:36,217
- Where is he?
- Who?

519
00:37:39,217 --> 00:37:40,686
Oh, Dr. Lee?

520
00:37:43,227 --> 00:37:46,426
From now on,
I'll be your doctor in charge.

521
00:37:46,426 --> 00:37:49,667
I heard Dr. Lee explained
everything to you.

522
00:37:52,467 --> 00:37:53,767
From now on,

523
00:37:53,767 --> 00:37:57,736
your medication might
increase a little.

524
00:37:58,337 --> 00:37:59,537
Will that be okay?

525
00:38:01,537 --> 00:38:03,246
Dr. Lee told me about...

526
00:38:03,246 --> 00:38:06,417
which medication
had side effects for you.

527
00:38:06,717 --> 00:38:07,917
So don't worry...

528
00:38:08,446 --> 00:38:09,816
and trust me.

529
00:38:31,537 --> 00:38:35,546
Luo, is there anyone else in here
besides you and me?

530
00:38:40,017 --> 00:38:42,147
No one can enter this office
without my permission.

531
00:38:42,147 --> 00:38:44,287
That friend you're looking at
right now.

532
00:38:44,287 --> 00:38:46,356
How did he come in here?

533
00:38:46,356 --> 00:38:47,616
I didn't call him.

534
00:38:48,727 --> 00:38:50,556
Go! Go!

535
00:38:50,957 --> 00:38:52,457
- Luo.
- Go! Go!

536
00:38:53,097 --> 00:38:54,597
- Go!
- Luo.

537
00:38:54,597 --> 00:38:57,426
- Go! Go!
- Luo, wait.

538
00:38:57,696 --> 00:38:59,967
- Go! Go! Go!
- Luo.

539
00:38:59,967 --> 00:39:01,467
- Luo, no one is here.
- Go! Go!

540
00:39:01,467 --> 00:39:03,707
- Luo, no, it's okay...
- Go! Go!

541
00:39:08,207 --> 00:39:09,647
Luo. Park Luo!

542
00:39:10,347 --> 00:39:11,477
Park Luo!

543
00:39:13,217 --> 00:39:14,277
Luo!

544
00:39:17,816 --> 00:39:20,017
Please call security.
It's an emergency.

545
00:39:24,787 --> 00:39:25,897
Luo!

546
00:39:36,337 --> 00:39:39,876
Dr. Lee! Dr. Lee! Dr. Lee!

547
00:39:43,606 --> 00:39:45,277
Luo. Luo!

548
00:39:46,746 --> 00:39:50,017
Luo. Luo. Luo!

549
00:39:52,717 --> 00:39:54,087
Are you insane?

550
00:39:54,816 --> 00:39:56,457
What have you done to a kid?

551
00:39:57,327 --> 00:39:59,196
We just followed protocol...

552
00:39:59,196 --> 00:40:01,756
I don't care about protocol.
Who told you to use this?

553
00:40:02,527 --> 00:40:04,397
Was this patient holding a weapon?

554
00:40:04,827 --> 00:40:06,236
Did he threaten you?

555
00:40:07,496 --> 00:40:08,537
I'm sorry.

556
00:40:09,366 --> 00:40:11,236
- Luo.
- What's going on?

557
00:40:36,327 --> 00:40:37,667
I mean,

558
00:40:37,926 --> 00:40:41,236
how could he do this to me
over one single mistake?

559
00:40:41,837 --> 00:40:44,106
I've totally been abandoned.

560
00:40:48,537 --> 00:40:50,546
Thank you for calling me today.

561
00:40:50,546 --> 00:40:52,616
You can cry all you want
until you feel better.

562
00:40:52,847 --> 00:40:54,847
Why is my life such a mess?

563
00:40:54,847 --> 00:40:56,287
What's wrong with your life?

564
00:40:59,056 --> 00:41:00,917
I can't get along with others.

565
00:41:03,827 --> 00:41:05,626
Once I think I've become
close with them,

566
00:41:08,457 --> 00:41:09,796
they all abandon me.

567
00:41:11,196 --> 00:41:15,607
Just like throwing away trash
in a recycling bin.

568
00:41:16,466 --> 00:41:18,107
I'm really nice to them though.

569
00:41:21,576 --> 00:41:23,777
The more I think about it,
it enrages me.

570
00:41:23,777 --> 00:41:25,517
What's the matter
with my darned life?

571
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:28,617
Do you know
what's even more annoying?

572
00:41:28,617 --> 00:41:30,686
That I still don't hate Lee Si Joon
despite all of this.

573
00:41:30,686 --> 00:41:32,117
That's what annoys me the most.

574
00:41:33,517 --> 00:41:34,887
Why do you think that is?

575
00:41:37,586 --> 00:41:38,826
Last time...

576
00:41:40,056 --> 00:41:41,127
Woo Joo,

577
00:41:41,226 --> 00:41:44,426
you aren't someone whose boyfriend
is allowed to cheat on you.

578
00:41:46,296 --> 00:41:48,706
You changed someone else's life.

579
00:41:50,237 --> 00:41:51,867
When I heard that,

580
00:41:53,537 --> 00:41:55,507
it felt like I was coming alive.

581
00:41:57,076 --> 00:41:59,546
Just like a withering flower...

582
00:41:59,716 --> 00:42:03,287
blooming brightly again
under the sun.

583
00:42:07,117 --> 00:42:08,657
Have you ever seen something
like this?

584
00:42:09,757 --> 00:42:12,027
When you see a halo
behind someone's head?

585
00:42:12,857 --> 00:42:15,257
I saw that halo
behind his head at that moment.

586
00:42:16,527 --> 00:42:17,726
He was like my savior.

587
00:42:21,267 --> 00:42:24,507
I always thought I was
a nuisance to others.

588
00:42:26,507 --> 00:42:27,907
But I was...

589
00:42:29,346 --> 00:42:32,647
actually someone
who could help someone.

590
00:42:33,546 --> 00:42:37,846
I was someone who could make
someone happy.

591
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:43,487
He was the one who taught me that.

592
00:42:46,357 --> 00:42:48,497
And I was so grateful.

593
00:42:51,466 --> 00:42:53,267
I keep thinking of that moment...

594
00:42:59,007 --> 00:43:02,346
You can't hate him since
he's the one who gave you courage.

595
00:43:03,507 --> 00:43:05,417
So it annoys me even more.

596
00:43:06,076 --> 00:43:08,247
I can't even cuss him out
because of that.

597
00:43:11,117 --> 00:43:12,857
Shall we become honest
with each other?

598
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:15,887
What do you want to do?

599
00:43:25,767 --> 00:43:27,497
I want to give back...

600
00:43:28,267 --> 00:43:31,706
exactly what he gave me.

601
00:43:40,877 --> 00:43:41,917
Dr. Lee.

602
00:43:45,247 --> 00:43:47,357
Dr. Lee, Luo has been
in an accident.

603
00:43:49,857 --> 00:43:50,887
What happened?

604
00:43:50,887 --> 00:43:53,657
While receiving counseling
with Dr. In, he ran out suddenly.

605
00:43:54,226 --> 00:43:56,096
And the security guards used
a taser gun on him...

606
00:43:56,096 --> 00:43:57,667
while they were trying to stop him.

607
00:43:59,667 --> 00:44:02,407
He wasn't hurt,
but I think he was shocked.

608
00:44:03,537 --> 00:44:05,907
I think it would be better
if you go see him.

609
00:44:06,976 --> 00:44:08,407
You must be very bored.

610
00:44:08,846 --> 00:44:11,306
- Pardon?
- Luo is Dr. In's patient now.

611
00:44:11,546 --> 00:44:13,277
Why do you care about
another team's patient?

612
00:44:13,277 --> 00:44:15,487
No, it's not that.

613
00:44:16,086 --> 00:44:18,586
I was told Luo ran off
to look for you.

614
00:44:18,586 --> 00:44:20,586
You're a third-year resident.

615
00:44:20,716 --> 00:44:22,586
Can't you tell what's important?

616
00:44:22,586 --> 00:44:24,456
Take better care of
Ms. Kim Young Seon.

617
00:44:25,956 --> 00:44:26,956
But...

618
00:44:35,537 --> 00:44:36,667
What?

619
00:44:37,167 --> 00:44:38,507
A taser?

620
00:44:39,877 --> 00:44:42,277
Those foolish sons of...

621
00:44:42,277 --> 00:44:44,176
How could they do such a thing?

622
00:44:44,176 --> 00:44:46,346
What is the matter with you?

623
00:45:00,426 --> 00:45:01,426
What is it?

624
00:45:01,426 --> 00:45:02,627
Are you going somewhere?

625
00:45:02,627 --> 00:45:04,267
I have a meeting.
Do you need to talk?

626
00:45:04,527 --> 00:45:06,966
No. I heard you'd gotten hurt.

627
00:45:06,966 --> 00:45:09,806
I wasn't hurt. I'm fine.

628
00:45:22,287 --> 00:45:24,086
How did that happen?

629
00:45:24,487 --> 00:45:26,657
I apologize. It's my fault.

630
00:45:27,186 --> 00:45:30,857
Nurse Oh. Was that patient
usually this disruptive?

631
00:45:30,857 --> 00:45:34,627
No. He took
a sudden change recently.

632
00:45:34,726 --> 00:45:36,397
Was there an incident?

633
00:45:37,367 --> 00:45:38,667
I think...

634
00:45:39,267 --> 00:45:41,296
we missed the timing to treat him.

635
00:45:41,966 --> 00:45:43,466
What do you mean by that?

636
00:45:43,637 --> 00:45:47,576
I think you should ask
Dr. Lee Si Joon yourself.

637
00:45:47,576 --> 00:45:49,946
Why Dr. Lee? Was there a problem?

638
00:45:49,946 --> 00:45:52,277
It's not for me to share.

639
00:45:52,446 --> 00:45:55,946
Mr. Deputy Director.
We're not here to discuss Dr. Lee.

640
00:45:55,946 --> 00:45:58,387
A security guard used a taser,

641
00:45:58,387 --> 00:46:00,956
making it look like
we assaulted a patient.

642
00:46:00,956 --> 00:46:03,487
We must tell Luo's mother
of his condition.

643
00:46:03,757 --> 00:46:04,787
What for?

644
00:46:04,787 --> 00:46:07,757
Of course, she must know.
Something happened to her son.

645
00:46:07,826 --> 00:46:12,066
Many people saw the security guard
use a taser on the boy.

646
00:46:12,066 --> 00:46:14,767
If we hide it,
it could become a bigger problem.

647
00:46:14,767 --> 00:46:18,107
Isn't it natural for
a security guard to have a taser?

648
00:46:19,476 --> 00:46:21,706
The problem is that
it was excessive.

649
00:46:26,117 --> 00:46:28,417
Dr. Park,
you tell the hospital director.

650
00:46:30,186 --> 00:46:31,247
Okay?

651
00:46:32,216 --> 00:46:33,387
Yes, sir.

652
00:46:33,887 --> 00:46:38,157
What if someone else
sues us over this?

653
00:46:39,056 --> 00:46:42,867
I'm more concerned Luo's mother
might want him discharged.

654
00:46:46,667 --> 00:46:47,696
Dr. In.

655
00:46:48,466 --> 00:46:51,607
If that's what she wants,
discharge the boy immediately.

656
00:46:51,867 --> 00:46:53,336
Don't say a word.

657
00:46:53,576 --> 00:46:56,476
Don't let anyone mention
involuntary admission.

658
00:47:01,747 --> 00:47:04,487
What was Nurse Oh
talking about earlier?

659
00:47:04,487 --> 00:47:05,917
Do you know anything?

660
00:47:06,586 --> 00:47:09,387
The nurses have a lot of work to do.

661
00:47:09,387 --> 00:47:11,887
I'm guessing
that's what she insinuated.

662
00:47:11,887 --> 00:47:15,326
No. There's definitely
something else.

663
00:47:15,997 --> 00:47:20,237
Find out what Nurse Oh meant by
missing the timing to treat Luo.

664
00:47:20,267 --> 00:47:23,107
That was just her crossing the line
when she doesn't know much.

665
00:47:23,107 --> 00:47:24,267
Shall I find out?

666
00:47:26,206 --> 00:47:27,507
I understand.

667
00:47:27,637 --> 00:47:29,976
Why is Si Joon so quiet?

668
00:47:30,446 --> 00:47:32,546
He should've kicked up
a fuss already.

669
00:47:46,426 --> 00:47:49,527
(Nursing home)

670
00:48:23,997 --> 00:48:25,027
What's going on?

671
00:48:25,527 --> 00:48:27,096
Why are you all out of it?

672
00:48:28,936 --> 00:48:31,167
Music. Do we have any music?

673
00:48:31,167 --> 00:48:32,637
Who are you?

674
00:48:32,637 --> 00:48:33,637
What?

675
00:48:34,737 --> 00:48:35,777
Who am I?

676
00:48:36,176 --> 00:48:39,976
I think you're in
the wrong operation room.

677
00:48:40,446 --> 00:48:42,017
What nonsense is that?

678
00:48:42,176 --> 00:48:43,586
I'm Lee Taek Kyung.

679
00:48:44,686 --> 00:48:45,787
Scalpel.

680
00:48:49,887 --> 00:48:51,487
What took you so long?

681
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:53,196
Stand opposite.

682
00:48:56,267 --> 00:48:58,367
- Come with me.
- Hey.

683
00:48:58,367 --> 00:49:00,867
Let go of me.
I can't leave during an operation.

684
00:49:01,196 --> 00:49:03,966
My gosh. Hey, are you crazy?

685
00:49:03,966 --> 00:49:07,076
Let go of me, you fool. Let go!

686
00:49:07,076 --> 00:49:08,137
That hurt.

687
00:49:11,206 --> 00:49:13,346
What is wrong with you?

688
00:49:16,987 --> 00:49:18,316
Why are you here?

689
00:49:18,387 --> 00:49:21,186
I said I'm operating at
my son's hospital.

690
00:49:22,287 --> 00:49:25,487
Why is it your son's hospital
of all the hospitals around?

691
00:49:26,127 --> 00:49:28,796
What is it you want to prove to him?

692
00:49:29,696 --> 00:49:31,296
You arrogant fool.

693
00:49:31,726 --> 00:49:33,966
Is there still more
you want to force upon him?

694
00:49:33,997 --> 00:49:35,667
What do you know to lecture me?

695
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:37,167
I know my son well.

696
00:49:37,167 --> 00:49:39,107
He needs to change specialties.

697
00:49:39,277 --> 00:49:42,946
He needs to see how great I am
in surgery if he's to wake up.

698
00:49:43,747 --> 00:49:45,076
Psychiatry?

699
00:49:45,277 --> 00:49:49,246
Why does he struggle with
weak-minded people?

700
00:49:51,587 --> 00:49:54,057
Do you know why
I became a psychiatrist?

701
00:49:54,286 --> 00:49:56,127
It was to understand you, Father.

702
00:49:56,127 --> 00:49:58,087
You're my father
and I couldn't understand you,

703
00:49:58,087 --> 00:50:01,256
so I became a psychiatrist
hoping to understand you!

704
00:50:03,897 --> 00:50:04,966
Lee Si Joon.

705
00:50:06,567 --> 00:50:08,867
- Dr. Park.
- Hello.

706
00:50:08,867 --> 00:50:10,567
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

707
00:50:11,367 --> 00:50:13,706
But who is this man over here?

708
00:50:13,706 --> 00:50:14,837
He's...

709
00:50:14,837 --> 00:50:15,976
I need to scrub in.

710
00:50:15,976 --> 00:50:17,976
He's new here.

711
00:50:17,976 --> 00:50:19,276
I'll talk to him.

712
00:50:19,276 --> 00:50:20,776
Wait right here.

713
00:50:20,776 --> 00:50:22,246
Wait here.

714
00:50:24,786 --> 00:50:26,286
I heard what happened.

715
00:50:26,286 --> 00:50:29,726
Even so, what are you doing
out in the open to a sick man?

716
00:50:29,857 --> 00:50:31,327
My father isn't a patient.

717
00:50:32,226 --> 00:50:33,526
He's very normal.

718
00:50:35,827 --> 00:50:37,026
He's normal enough...

719
00:50:37,526 --> 00:50:40,097
to report his son to
the Human Rights Commission.

720
00:50:40,097 --> 00:50:41,167
What?

721
00:50:44,067 --> 00:50:46,107
He reported you?

722
00:50:46,107 --> 00:50:47,337
Yes.

723
00:50:48,176 --> 00:50:49,577
It was my father.

724
00:50:51,276 --> 00:50:53,147
How would he know to do that?

725
00:50:53,347 --> 00:50:54,516
Because...

726
00:50:55,946 --> 00:50:58,087
I told him that
I had Luo admitted...

727
00:50:58,847 --> 00:51:00,557
against his will.

728
00:51:05,286 --> 00:51:07,026
That's what I wanted to say.

729
00:51:14,067 --> 00:51:15,236
Sleep well.

730
00:51:17,807 --> 00:51:20,536
I wanted to come clean to someone
about what I'd done,

731
00:51:21,276 --> 00:51:23,377
but I knew it could
become a problem,

732
00:51:24,547 --> 00:51:27,077
so I told my father
because he'd never remember.

733
00:51:30,686 --> 00:51:31,686
But...

734
00:51:33,817 --> 00:51:35,387
when I was there talking,

735
00:51:35,686 --> 00:51:38,087
he was completely lucid and fine.

736
00:51:40,557 --> 00:51:43,167
He understood what I'd said
and feigned ignorance then,

737
00:51:44,097 --> 00:51:45,567
and then reported me.

738
00:51:50,567 --> 00:51:51,567
Why?

739
00:51:52,536 --> 00:51:54,436
Because he still hasn't given up.

740
00:51:55,377 --> 00:51:56,407
He...

741
00:51:58,006 --> 00:51:59,617
hates it so much that...

742
00:52:00,817 --> 00:52:02,147
I'm a psychiatrist.

743
00:52:03,347 --> 00:52:06,057
He still wants to
crush his son whenever he can.

744
00:52:06,286 --> 00:52:09,926
Hey. Speak so that I understand.
What are you talking about?

745
00:52:14,157 --> 00:52:15,726
Please, do just one thing.

746
00:52:15,726 --> 00:52:16,726
What?

747
00:52:18,067 --> 00:52:20,337
Be a father like oil and water,

748
00:52:24,006 --> 00:52:25,607
or be a pitiful patient.

749
00:52:42,357 --> 00:52:44,186
What was that about?

750
00:52:44,186 --> 00:52:46,696
Why not come to my office
for some tea?

751
00:52:46,696 --> 00:52:47,857
- Shall I?
- Yes.

752
00:52:53,567 --> 00:52:55,667
You're the one who's suffering.

753
00:52:58,266 --> 00:52:59,337
Let's go.

754
00:53:01,077 --> 00:53:03,647
Don't just stand there. Let's go.

755
00:53:05,676 --> 00:53:07,676
Come on. Come with me.

756
00:53:07,676 --> 00:53:10,347
Let go of my arm.

757
00:53:12,087 --> 00:53:14,117
By the way, Doctor.

758
00:53:14,486 --> 00:53:16,786
Did you really report him?

759
00:53:16,786 --> 00:53:17,857
Yes, I did.

760
00:53:19,157 --> 00:53:21,627
Do you remember reporting him?

761
00:53:21,627 --> 00:53:23,567
Do you take me for a fool?

762
00:53:23,766 --> 00:53:25,627
Why wouldn't I remember what I said?

763
00:53:30,067 --> 00:53:32,936
Why do you look so old?

764
00:53:33,476 --> 00:53:37,547
What? Do you have any idea
how old I am?

765
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:39,107
Dye your hair.

766
00:53:39,107 --> 00:53:41,776
One would think you're
a department head in your 50s.

767
00:53:41,776 --> 00:53:43,387
Yes. In my 50s.

768
00:53:43,986 --> 00:53:47,087
You're smiling? You need to grow up.

769
00:53:47,087 --> 00:53:49,827
Fall in love, get married,
and have kids.

770
00:53:50,486 --> 00:53:54,857
My gosh. How much longer
will you be so hard on others?

771
00:53:54,857 --> 00:53:57,966
Aren't you exhausted?
It could ruin your health.

772
00:53:57,966 --> 00:53:59,367
I have been thinking...

773
00:54:00,696 --> 00:54:03,367
I might have dementia or something.

774
00:54:03,367 --> 00:54:05,436
I get forgetful sometimes.

775
00:54:05,436 --> 00:54:08,307
Don't you shed tears
for no reason too?

776
00:54:08,407 --> 00:54:10,476
Depression usually
accompanies dementia.

777
00:54:10,476 --> 00:54:13,347
Are you crazy?
Why would I cry? I'm a man.

778
00:54:14,716 --> 00:54:17,286
You should cry every now and then.

779
00:54:17,286 --> 00:54:18,786
Don't hold back your tears.

780
00:54:19,317 --> 00:54:21,557
You can cry freely now.

781
00:54:22,216 --> 00:54:23,986
You've been through a lot.

782
00:54:28,297 --> 00:54:30,766
What? Did I offend you?

783
00:54:32,097 --> 00:54:33,367
Will you scold me?

784
00:54:35,736 --> 00:54:36,936
Who are you?

785
00:54:41,337 --> 00:54:42,377
Where...

786
00:54:43,607 --> 00:54:44,746
Where am I?

787
00:54:49,047 --> 00:54:50,246
What is this place?

788
00:55:10,637 --> 00:55:14,206
Whatever happens in this room,

789
00:55:14,206 --> 00:55:15,506
no one will know.

790
00:55:18,506 --> 00:55:20,676
I couldn't sleep a wink last night.

791
00:55:22,917 --> 00:55:25,047
Do you know
what I looked up all night?

792
00:55:28,986 --> 00:55:30,357
"How to turn back time."

793
00:55:31,887 --> 00:55:35,327
Wouldn't it be nice
if I were able to...

794
00:55:35,327 --> 00:55:36,766
reverse time by 24 hours?

795
00:55:38,226 --> 00:55:39,837
But there's no way of doing that.

796
00:55:40,667 --> 00:55:43,607
What happened yesterday
wasn't solely your fault.

797
00:55:44,036 --> 00:55:45,236
Don't blame yourself.

798
00:55:45,837 --> 00:55:48,676
The doctors are mostly responsible
for not managing the patients.

799
00:55:50,976 --> 00:55:52,147
I know that.

800
00:55:53,176 --> 00:55:54,676
But I'm the one that got fired.

801
00:55:55,516 --> 00:55:57,387
None of the doctors got fired.

802
00:55:58,147 --> 00:55:59,516
So are you here to complain?

803
00:56:00,186 --> 00:56:01,587
Because you think it's unfair?

804
00:56:03,357 --> 00:56:05,226
I do feel wronged and angry,

805
00:56:07,857 --> 00:56:10,297
but for some odd reason,
I didn't hate you.

806
00:56:11,597 --> 00:56:13,936
I should fly into a rage
and curse you out,

807
00:56:14,036 --> 00:56:15,637
but I didn't feel like it.

808
00:56:16,506 --> 00:56:18,236
I wondered why that was.

809
00:56:20,077 --> 00:56:21,736
Then I realized that...

810
00:56:22,137 --> 00:56:23,407
it's because...

811
00:56:24,807 --> 00:56:26,917
I owe you so much.

812
00:56:27,817 --> 00:56:30,547
Until I pay you back,
my life will stay twisted.

813
00:56:34,587 --> 00:56:36,887
So I want to repay you
for what you did.

814
00:56:38,057 --> 00:56:39,186
Can I do that?

815
00:56:39,797 --> 00:56:42,597
Do whatever you want. I don't care.

816
00:56:46,026 --> 00:56:49,297
Okay. Then sit down over there.

817
00:57:03,917 --> 00:57:05,317
Listen to this.

818
00:58:37,847 --> 00:58:42,577
I want to give back
exactly what he gave me.

819
00:58:42,716 --> 00:58:43,946
What did he give you?

820
00:58:46,186 --> 00:58:47,357
Comfort.

821
00:58:59,696 --> 00:59:00,867
You know...

822
00:59:03,867 --> 00:59:05,137
Guess what?

823
00:59:06,907 --> 00:59:09,006
A person who notices
someone who is sick...

824
00:59:10,746 --> 00:59:12,647
is someone who is even sicker.

825
00:59:14,776 --> 00:59:18,016
You treat sick people...

826
00:59:19,417 --> 00:59:20,516
probably because...

827
00:59:21,557 --> 00:59:23,756
you hurt even more inside.

828
00:59:30,097 --> 00:59:32,867
When you feel down,
listening to drums...

829
00:59:32,867 --> 00:59:34,637
is supposed to help.

830
00:59:35,897 --> 00:59:38,236
You comforted me,

831
00:59:39,036 --> 00:59:41,607
and I wanted to comfort you.

832
00:59:43,476 --> 00:59:45,407
Rather than how we meet,

833
00:59:45,946 --> 00:59:50,016
how we part is more important.

834
00:59:56,827 --> 00:59:57,887
There.

835
00:59:59,226 --> 01:00:00,226
That's it.

836
01:00:41,837 --> 01:00:44,706
(Fix You)

837
01:00:45,337 --> 01:00:48,236
Before I realize it,
I'm waiting for him.

838
01:00:48,236 --> 01:00:49,276
She's transitioning.

839
01:00:49,276 --> 01:00:51,776
What if it's not a transition
and she really likes him?

840
01:00:51,776 --> 01:00:53,647
Do you know
of the Secret Photo Gallery?

841
01:00:53,647 --> 01:00:56,047
Did you post my photo
on the Secret Photo Gallery?

842
01:00:56,047 --> 01:00:57,617
How could they have voyeurism?

843
01:00:57,617 --> 01:00:59,547
Are you saying I'm a pervert?

844
01:00:59,547 --> 01:01:01,186
I haven't seen you before.

845
01:01:01,186 --> 01:01:02,387
Where's your pride?

846
01:01:02,387 --> 01:01:03,926
Nothing in my life is normal.

847
01:01:03,926 --> 01:01:05,786
Why would I have any pride?

848
01:01:05,786 --> 01:01:08,397
Can't you just take her back
as if you can't do without her?

849
01:01:08,456 --> 01:01:11,297
I made a decision a long time ago.

850
01:01:11,367 --> 01:01:14,837
But recently, I am losing my resolve
because of you, Woo Joo.
