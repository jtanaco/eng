<i><b>Was it a really long dream?</i></b>

6
00:01:02,007 --> 00:01:04,218
<b>It was my first time seeing
a house like that.</b>

7
00:01:05,177 --> 00:01:08,222
<b>A house with a gate and a sofa.</b>

8
00:01:09,807 --> 00:01:13,310

11
00:01:20,151 --> 00:01:21,444
<b>I thought to myself.</b>

12
00:01:21,527 --> 00:01:23,362
<b>It could really be just a dream.</b>

13

<b>Why do you think that
Kang Hyeon-min is a memory?</b>

14

<b>I met someone.</b>

<b>Someone from that world.</b>

16
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,752
<b>Did they say that
they're from a different world?</b>

17
00:01:38,335 --> 00:01:39,462
<b>Do you think I'm delusional?</b>

18
00:01:39,545 --> 00:01:40,921
<b>Well, the symptoms...</b>

19
00:01:43,257 --> 00:01:44,633
<b>Enough about the nightmare.</b>

20

23
00:02:00,024 --> 00:02:01,358
<b>Why aren't you answering my calls?</b>

24
00:02:02,234 --> 00:02:04,278
<b>Do you know how many days
I staked out this place?</b>

25
00:02:06,572 --> 00:02:07,573
<b>Good for you.</b>

26
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:09,200
<b>You have too much time to kill.</b>

<b>The bill, please.</b>

28
00:02:12,536 --> 00:02:13,662

<b>Do you want me to tell you?</b>

32
00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:23,547
<b>Let's talk another time.
I'm still on my vacation.</b>

34
00:02:29,303 --> 00:02:30,471
<b>Lee Sang-do is alive.</b>

<b>Lee Sang-do and Jang Yeon-ji

<b>to have had two cell phones.</b>

38

<b>There's another world where people

<b>I've been there.</b>

41

<b>A crime that takes place

<b>but I can't report it.</b>

43
00:02:56,914 --> 00:02:58,499
<b>How can I provide any evidence?</b>

44
00:02:59,792 --> 00:03:01,210
<b>Someone has to stop this,</b>

45
00:03:01,877 --> 00:03:03,003
<b>but you're the only one</b>

46
00:03:04,505 --> 00:03:05,464
<b>I can think of.</b>

47
00:03:07,216 --> 00:03:08,050
<b>Help me.</b>

48
00:03:12,054 --> 00:03:14,598
<b>That's not science fiction.
I call that a delusion.</b>

49
00:03:15,224 --> 00:03:16,475
<b>What "another world"?</b>

50
00:03:16,976 --> 00:03:18,394
<b>Get a hold of yourself, you fool.</b>

51

<i><b>This...</i></b>

<b>No way.</b>

54
00:03:47,381 --> 00:03:48,549
<i><b>That's</i></b>

55

<i><b>where he is, biding his time.</i></b>

56

<i><b>Only ten days to the last day of the year.</i></b>

57
00:03:54,763 --> 00:03:56,432
<i><b>I have about five hours.</i></b>

58
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,518
<i><b>And another thing I missed</i></b>

<i><b>When the sun goes down

62
00:04:20,205 --> 00:04:24,209
<i><b>I shall wait by the gate.</i></b>

63
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:32,217
<i><b>Between the shadows of the birds
singing at dawn,</i></b>

64
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,970
<i><b>I see the world brightening up</i></b>

65
00:04:36,138 --> 00:04:38,057
<i><b>in its still calmness.</i></b>

66
00:05:25,187 --> 00:05:27,648
<i><b>With my eyes fixated on
the traveler passing by</i></b>

67
00:05:28,649 --> 00:05:31,276
<i><b>at the break of dawn,</i></b>

68
00:05:34,446 --> 00:05:36,198
<i><b>"Is that you?"</i></b>

69
00:05:37,574 --> 00:05:39,618
<i><b>"Is that you?"</i></b>

70
00:05:42,788 --> 00:05:43,664
<b>Hey.</b>

71
00:05:49,962 --> 00:05:50,879
<b>What?</b>

72
00:05:52,589 --> 00:05:53,882
<b>You're finally here.</b>

73
00:05:54,425 --> 00:05:55,843
<b>Did you just get here?</b>

74
00:06:25,289 --> 00:06:27,791
<b>Have you been waiting here?</b>

75
00:06:31,003 --> 00:06:32,629
<b>Are you really here?</b>

76
00:06:34,006 --> 00:06:36,633
<b>Not yet. Not entirely.</b>

77
00:06:40,512 --> 00:06:41,847
<b>I missed you so much.</b>

78
00:06:43,432 --> 00:06:44,600
<b>I missed you like crazy,</b>

79
00:06:46,977 --> 00:06:49,021
<b>so I was going to just hear your voice
and leave.</b>

80
00:06:51,315 --> 00:06:52,316
<b>My voice?</b>

81
00:06:54,526 --> 00:06:57,654
<b>I was going to call you
from that pay phone over there.</b>

82
00:07:33,816 --> 00:07:36,151
<b>You really need to tell me now.</b>

83
00:07:36,735 --> 00:07:38,278
<b>Where is His Majesty?</b>

84
00:07:39,321 --> 00:07:41,615
<b>It's the New Year's ceremony.</b>

85
00:07:41,698 --> 00:07:45,828
<b>You need to at least help me
come up with an excuse for his absence.</b>

86
00:07:45,953 --> 00:07:48,914
<b>Don't worry.
Just plan for it as we normally do.</b>

87
00:07:49,665 --> 00:07:51,625
<b>His Majesty will return
before Lunar New Year.</b>

88
00:07:52,292 --> 00:07:53,293
<b>But Lunar New Year is...</b>

89
00:07:54,128 --> 00:07:55,838
<b>the day after tomorrow.</b>

90
00:07:57,673 --> 00:08:00,217
<b>I'm on my way to an early grave

91
00:08:06,306 --> 00:08:07,182
<b>Your Majesty.</b>

92
00:08:12,271 --> 00:08:13,438
<b>What's the date today?</b>

93
00:08:14,189 --> 00:08:15,023
<b>Am I back on time?</b>

94
00:08:16,191 --> 00:08:18,318
<b>Lunar New Year should be in a day or two.</b>

95
00:08:18,402 --> 00:08:19,987
<b>It's the 23rd.</b>

96
00:08:20,988 --> 00:08:22,948
<b>You came just in time.</b>

97
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,160
<b>Thank God.</b>

98
00:08:27,161 --> 00:08:28,996
<b>I lost count.</b>

99
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:32,666
<b>What on earth is happening?</b>

100
00:08:34,376 --> 00:08:36,420
<b>Your Majesty, did you have
a secret rendezvous or...</b>

101
00:08:38,297 --> 00:08:40,132
<b>Something amazing like that?</b>

102
00:08:40,883 --> 00:08:42,718
<b>It's more like illegal immigration,</b>

103
00:08:43,594 --> 00:08:44,887
<b>but it was quite amazing indeed.</b>

104
00:08:45,387 --> 00:08:46,555
<b>I'll see you tomorrow.</b>

105
00:08:54,188 --> 00:08:55,522
<b>Here's the hotel room key.</b>

106
00:08:56,481 --> 00:08:57,357
<b>Thank you.</b>

107
00:08:59,443 --> 00:09:02,112
<b>We never even had a chance
to grab a bite together. Eat up.</b>

108
00:09:03,822 --> 00:09:06,074
<b>I'm going to have to leave
as soon as I finish this.</b>

109
00:09:08,202 --> 00:09:09,494
<b>This guy's family is coming.</b>

110
00:09:11,496 --> 00:09:12,706
<b>Lunar New Year is already here.</b>

111
00:09:13,457 --> 00:09:14,917
<b>I feel bad you have to spend
the holiday here.</b>

112
00:09:16,126 --> 00:09:19,671
<b>I know I'm stuck here,
but Eun-sup is in the same situation.</b>

113
00:09:22,674 --> 00:09:25,886
<b>Just make sure you don't get
on Eun-bi's nerves. You can't beat her.</b>

114
00:09:26,428 --> 00:09:27,971
<b>Don't worry about that.</b>

115
00:09:28,722 --> 00:09:30,224
<b>I'm worried that she's too fond of me.</b>

116
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:32,768
<b>I should get going.</b>

117
00:09:35,062 --> 00:09:36,313
<b>Happy New Year.</b>

118
00:09:38,273 --> 00:09:39,483
<b>Happy New Year to you too.</b>

119
00:10:01,713 --> 00:10:02,965
<b>What are you doing?</b>

120
00:10:03,924 --> 00:10:04,967
<b>Stand straight.</b>

121
00:10:07,594 --> 00:10:08,929
<b>Your uncle is waiting.</b>

122
00:10:09,721 --> 00:10:11,848
<b>Every year, you put this on just fine
all by yourself.</b>

123
00:10:11,974 --> 00:10:12,849
<i><b>Every year?</i></b>

124
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,434
<i><b>This?</i></b>

125
00:10:15,102 --> 00:10:16,311
<i><b>These multicolored stripes?</i></b>

126
00:10:17,688 --> 00:10:18,605
<b>What? Jeez.</b>

127
00:10:27,531 --> 00:10:28,407
<b>Mom.</b>

128
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:29,533
<b>Yes, what?</b>

129
00:10:30,701 --> 00:10:32,327
<b>I've been watching him carefully.</b>

130
00:10:32,911 --> 00:10:34,079
<b>You see, that man</b>

131
00:10:36,623 --> 00:10:37,624
<b>isn't Eun-sup.</b>

132
00:10:39,501 --> 00:10:41,086
<b>What do you mean?</b>

133
00:10:41,586 --> 00:10:43,922
<b>Daddy is waiting in the car.</b>

134
00:10:44,006 --> 00:10:48,176
<b>If you look carefully, he's changed
for the better but worse in some ways.</b>

135
00:10:48,552 --> 00:10:49,594
<b>What?</b>

136
00:10:51,513 --> 00:10:53,223
<b>He's much cooler now,</b>

137
00:10:54,433 --> 00:10:56,393
<b>but he's also become a prick!</b>

138
00:10:58,729 --> 00:10:59,730
<b>Eun-sup.</b>

139
00:11:00,397 --> 00:11:01,732
<b>What is this?</b>

140
00:11:02,065 --> 00:11:03,358
<b>Hey, don't touch that.</b>

141
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:14,369
<b>It's a souvenir from the military.</b>

142
00:11:16,288 --> 00:11:18,290
<b>See? Let's call the police now.</b>

143
00:11:19,082 --> 00:11:20,792
<b>The entire Jo family is at stake.</b>

144
00:11:22,461 --> 00:11:24,504
<b>He is my son.</b>

145
00:11:25,922 --> 00:11:30,385
<b>I gave birth to this cool guy here
for the Jo family.</b>

146
00:11:35,682 --> 00:11:37,309
<b>You've been discharged. Grow up, will you?</b>

147
00:11:37,893 --> 00:11:39,811
<b>Why are you playing with kids' toys?</b>

148
00:11:41,355 --> 00:11:42,939
<b>Get ready, okay?</b>

149
00:11:59,164 --> 00:12:00,248
<b>The Republic of Korea.</b>

150
00:12:00,832 --> 00:12:04,002
<b>How come a mere seven-year-old here
is sharp enough to join the Royal Guards.</b>

151
00:12:06,963 --> 00:12:08,006
<b>I mean,</b>

152
00:12:09,216 --> 00:12:11,510
<b>who works the night shift
on New Year's Day?</b>

153
00:12:12,636 --> 00:12:16,807
<b>This happened
because our squad has no power.</b>

154
00:12:17,974 --> 00:12:20,811
<b>Somebody had to do this,
so let's just be glad we got the job done.</b>

155
00:12:21,561 --> 00:12:22,396
<b>I like it.</b>

156
00:12:22,854 --> 00:12:25,941
<b>The sunrise, the coffee,
and the first night duty of the new year.</b>

157
00:12:26,691 --> 00:12:28,318
<b>It's what

00:34:53,115 --> 00:34:55,325
<b>Are you hurt?</b>

464
00:34:56,868 --> 00:34:58,704
<b>Is Captain Jo okay?</b>

465
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,081
<b>Both Yeong and I are fine.</b>

466
00:35:09,256 --> 00:35:11,341
<b>By the way, is it true?</b>

467
00:35:12,426 --> 00:35:14,553
<b>Did you really see Traitor Lee Lim?</b>

468
00:35:15,595 --> 00:35:16,471
<b>I chased him.</b>

469
00:35:17,597 --> 00:35:18,682
<b>I chased after him</b>

470
00:35:20,183 --> 00:35:21,268
<b>but I let him get away.</b>

471
00:35:21,935 --> 00:35:22,978
<b>Why?</b>

472
00:35:23,061 --> 00:35:24,688
<b>Lee Lim looked exactly the same as he did</b>

473
00:35:25,397 --> 00:35:26,356
<b>25 years ago.</b>

474
00:35:27,315 --> 00:35:28,275
<b>He hasn't aged at all.</b>

475
00:35:28,859 --> 00:35:31,361
<b>What? He hasn't aged?</b>

476
00:35:31,653 --> 00:35:34,656
<b>See? I can't even convince you.</b>

477
00:35:35,615 --> 00:35:37,325
<b>I can't even explain,
let alone convince you.</b>

478
00:35:38,285 --> 00:35:39,578
<b>That's what he's after.</b>

479
00:35:40,454 --> 00:35:41,663
<b>Returning to this world</b>

480
00:35:42,497 --> 00:35:44,124
<b>as a man who doesn't age.</b>

481
00:35:45,625 --> 00:35:46,877
<b>That's why I let him go.</b>

482
00:35:48,712 --> 00:35:49,755
<b>So please</b>

483
00:35:51,214 --> 00:35:52,841
<b>pray that I will win this fight.</b>

484
00:35:54,384 --> 00:35:55,469
<b>I will win no matter what.</b>

485
00:35:56,595 --> 00:35:57,512
<b>Your Majesty.</b>

486
00:36:03,643 --> 00:36:05,812
<b>Your Majesty,
Prime Minister Koo is on the phone.</b>

487
00:36:08,815 --> 00:36:09,858
<b>Here's His Majesty.</b>

488
00:36:13,361 --> 00:36:14,529
<b>Prime Minister Koo.</b>

489
00:36:15,113 --> 00:36:16,114
<b>I'm fine.</b>

490
00:36:16,865 --> 00:36:19,034
<b>If you called to check up on me,
let's talk another time.</b>

491
00:36:19,117 --> 00:36:21,078
<i><b>I already heard that all is well
with Your Majesty.</i></b>

492
00:36:21,828 --> 00:36:22,913
<i><b>I'm truly relieved.</i></b>

493
00:36:23,538 --> 00:36:26,083
<i><b>But you must be distraught,
so I'll keep this short.</i></b>

494
00:36:26,666 --> 00:36:27,542
<b>What is it?</b>

495
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:31,213
<b>Conspiracy theory about
Lee Lim, the traitor has been spreading.</b>

496
00:36:31,713 --> 00:36:34,466
<b>Hence, I'd like to ask you a question
out of genuine concern.</b>

497
00:36:35,467 --> 00:36:37,010
<b>I trust that you'll be honest with me.</b>

498
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:40,013
<b>Was it Lee Lim?</b>

499
00:36:41,306 --> 00:36:42,724
<b>Or his followers?</b>

500
00:36:47,187 --> 00:36:50,565
<b>Prime Minister Koo, have you started
your horseback-riding lessons yet?</b>

501
00:36:51,358 --> 00:36:52,734
<b>I beg your pardon?</b>

502
00:36:52,901 --> 00:36:56,696
<b>The gag should act as a mediator
between the horse and the rider.</b>

503
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,698
<b>What I mean by that is,</b>

504
00:36:59,491 --> 00:37:01,785
<b>no one should pull the gag
to change the horse's direction.</b>

505
00:37:02,994 --> 00:37:04,412
<b>What happened today</b>

506
00:37:04,663 --> 00:37:07,207
<b>was not just about the Royal Court
or me, the King.</b>

507
00:37:07,791 --> 00:37:09,042
<b>It was an act of terrorism.</b>

508
00:37:10,293 --> 00:37:15,006
<b>As recorded in history, Lee Lim
was shot to death a year after the coup.</b>

509
00:37:15,799 --> 00:37:17,008
<b>And 25 years later,</b>

510
00:37:17,592 --> 00:37:21,263
<b>I found some of his followers
and went after them.</b>

511
00:37:23,598 --> 00:37:24,599
<i><b>Hence, I beseech you.</i></b>

512
00:37:25,725 --> 00:37:26,601
<i><b>Prime Minister Koo.</i></b>

513
00:37:27,602 --> 00:37:28,854
<b>Do not pull the gag.</b>

514
00:37:30,272 --> 00:37:32,065
<b>Do not use the word "honesty"
as your weapon.</b>

515
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:35,402
<b>Please focus solely on protecting
the safety of the people.</b>

516
00:37:37,112 --> 00:37:38,071
<b>That's it for now.</b>

517
00:37:41,616 --> 00:37:43,952
<b>-Are you preparing the brief?
-Yes.</b>

518
00:37:44,035 --> 00:37:45,662
<b>Would that summary be enough?</b>

519
00:37:45,745 --> 00:37:46,913
<b>Yes, Your Majesty.</b>

520
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:57,674
<b>I'm Jo Hye-mi from Haejung Daily.</b>

521
00:37:58,049 --> 00:38:00,927
<b>Rumor has it that His Majesty called a man
"Traitor Lee Lim"</b>

522
00:38:01,011 --> 00:38:02,804
<b>on the night of January 25.</b>

523
00:38:03,388 --> 00:38:06,892
<b>Lee Lim was supposedly shot to death.
Is there a chance that he may be alive?</b>

524
00:38:08,351 --> 00:38:10,812
<b>We were asked the exact same question
25 years ago,</b>

525
00:38:11,563 --> 00:38:14,024
<b>and the Royal Court's answer
remains the same today.</b>

526
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,276
<b>No, it's impossible.</b>

527
00:38:17,444 --> 00:38:20,530
<b>His Majesty found
one of Lee Lim's followers.</b>

528
00:38:20,906 --> 00:38:22,824
<b>His Majesty chased him but lost him.</b>

529
00:38:26,786 --> 00:38:27,746
<b>Go ahead.</b>

530
00:38:27,829 --> 00:38:29,748
<b>You just mentioned
the traitor's followers.</b>

531
00:38:29,915 --> 00:38:32,792
<b>Why do you think they resurfaced?</b>

532
00:38:34,502 --> 00:38:36,379
<b>As the royal court's press secretary,</b>

533
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:40,258
<b>I have no interest in their intentions.</b>

534
00:38:41,801 --> 00:38:46,223
<b>The Royal Court's only concern is to
hunt them down and bring them to justice.</b>

535
00:38:47,098 --> 00:38:48,141
<b>-Next.
-Here!</b>

536
00:38:48,225 --> 00:38:49,726
<b>-Over here!
-Here!</b>

537
00:38:53,772 --> 00:38:54,814
<b>A cell phone?</b>

538
00:38:55,774 --> 00:38:57,025
<b>What do you mean?</b>

539
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:01,446
<b>A smartphone and a 2G phone.</b>

540
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:04,199
<b>You had two cell phones.</b>

541
00:39:04,282 --> 00:39:05,951
<b>I don't know what you're talking about.</b>

542
00:39:06,034 --> 00:39:07,077
<b>I'm sure you do.</b>

543
00:39:11,414 --> 00:39:13,625
<b>This phone. It's yours, right?</b>

544
00:39:17,379 --> 00:39:21,549
<b>On this phone was something
that had to be kept confidential,</b>

545
00:39:22,342 --> 00:39:24,344
<b>but your friend happened to hear it.</b>

546
00:39:25,011 --> 00:39:28,765
<b>That's why you killed her according to
what you read about in the script.</b>

547
00:39:30,267 --> 00:39:33,186
<b>Because you were sure
that someone was going to get you out.</b>

548
00:39:37,691 --> 00:39:38,566
<b>Right?</b>

549
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:42,320
<b>Who gave you this phone?</b>

550
00:39:44,364 --> 00:39:45,365
<b>What...</b>

551
00:39:47,325 --> 00:39:49,911
<b>Like I said, I have no idea
what you're talking about.</b>

552
00:39:51,079 --> 00:39:51,913
<b>What do you think?</b>

553
00:39:52,872 --> 00:39:54,040
<b>I think you're onto something.</b>

554
00:40:15,437 --> 00:40:17,480
<b>I managed to trick her
with Lee Sang-do's phone,</b>

555
00:40:17,981 --> 00:40:20,150
<b>but I wonder where Jang Yeon-ji hid hers.</b>

556
00:40:22,819 --> 00:40:25,322
<b>Hey, are you listening?</b>

557
00:40:29,159 --> 00:40:30,618
<b>Did you spot something outside?</b>

558
00:40:32,871 --> 00:40:34,873
<b>What? Do you know whose car that is?</b>

559
00:40:35,498 --> 00:40:36,708
<b>I may have seen it before.</b>

560
00:40:37,459 --> 00:40:38,585
<b>I'll drive.</b>

561
00:40:41,087 --> 00:40:43,131
<b>PERSONAL INFORMATION</b>

562
00:40:43,298 --> 00:40:44,591
<b>VEHICLE INFORMATION</b>

563
00:40:48,094 --> 00:40:50,972
<b>VEHICLE INFORMATION
VEHICLE REGISTRATION NUMBER</b>

564
00:40:57,562 --> 00:40:58,605
<b>Zero.</b>

565
00:40:59,689 --> 00:41:01,524
<b>If it's the car in front of
the barbecue place,</b>

566
00:41:03,401 --> 00:41:04,235
<i><b>then it's zero.</i></b>

567
00:41:06,863 --> 00:41:08,073
<b>Chief, you never let me down.</b>

568
00:41:14,245 --> 00:41:15,121
<b>PENDING APPROVAL</b>

569
00:41:15,830 --> 00:41:16,873
<b>Could you approve this?</b>

570
00:41:18,124 --> 00:41:20,085
<b>Hey, why are you after that car?
What's going on?</b>

571
00:41:20,168 --> 00:41:21,086
<b>Did something happen?</b>

572
00:41:21,669 --> 00:41:22,712
<b>I'm about to find out.</b>

573
00:41:24,589 --> 00:41:25,799
<b>This is Kang Sin-jae, Squad 3.</b>

574
00:41:25,882 --> 00:41:27,884
<b>I requested a vehicle check.
When can it be done?</b>

575
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:30,387
<b>Okay, thank you.</b>

576
00:41:32,931 --> 00:41:34,391
<b>You need a partner.</b>

577
00:41:34,974 --> 00:41:37,060
<b>Hey, you should partner up with Jangmi.</b>

578
00:41:37,519 --> 00:41:38,895
<b>All right, I have to step out.</b>

579
00:41:39,729 --> 00:41:40,605
<b>Oh, Detective Shim.</b>

580
00:41:40,688 --> 00:41:41,564
<b>Yes?</b>

581
00:41:41,648 --> 00:41:43,274
<b>You had a drink with me last night, okay?</b>

582
00:41:43,358 --> 00:41:44,776
<b>Why? You picked me, out of everyone?</b>

583
00:41:44,859 --> 00:41:46,694
<b>Wait, Chief! Hold on.</b>

584
00:41:46,945 --> 00:41:47,904
<b>Hold on a second.</b>

585
00:41:48,738 --> 00:41:49,864
<b>Chief.</b>

586
00:41:50,448 --> 00:41:52,158
<b>Seriously, who are you meeting?</b>

587
00:41:54,786 --> 00:41:55,662
<b>Solitude.</b>

588
00:41:56,579 --> 00:41:58,790
<b>Jeez, come on. Chief!</b>

589
00:42:01,292 --> 00:42:02,335
<b>See you later, sir.</b>

590
00:42:05,505 --> 00:42:07,048
<b>Did you get information on the vehicle?</b>

591
00:42:07,549 --> 00:42:08,967
<b>It'll take about half an hour.</b>

592
00:42:10,051 --> 00:42:12,095
<b>Order some food. I want <i>dolsot</i> bibimbap.</b>

593
00:42:12,178 --> 00:42:14,222
<b>Then I'll order a steak...</b>

594
00:42:15,849 --> 00:42:17,976
<b>Never mind.</b>

595
00:42:19,394 --> 00:42:20,937
<i><b>Dolsot</i> bibimbap for everyone, okay?</b>

596
00:42:34,742 --> 00:42:36,327
<i><b>We worked so hard to protect this nation.</i></b>

597
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:39,080
<b>And we're starting the year off

<b>With the traitor's followers?</b>

599
00:42:41,499 --> 00:42:44,085
<b>You see, every family needs
a strong pillar.</b>

600
00:42:44,169 --> 00:42:45,837
<b>It's because we have
a woman prime minister.</b>

601
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,298
<b>That hen keeps on squawking
every single day.</b>

602
00:42:48,798 --> 00:42:51,384
<b>No wonder even the deceased traitor's
followers are causing a scene.</b>

603
00:42:51,968 --> 00:42:54,637
<b>We are truly concerned
about His Majesty's safety.</b>

604
00:42:54,721 --> 00:42:56,556
<b>You saw how Park Cheol-ung suffered.</b>

605
00:42:57,098 --> 00:42:59,350
<b>If this isn't a terror attack, what is?</b>

606
00:42:59,642 --> 00:43:01,686
<b>Your Highness, the timing is perfect.</b>

607
00:43:01,769 --> 00:43:05,398
<b>Just express your deep concern
as the oldest member of the Royal Family.</b>

608
00:43:05,899 --> 00:43:07,901
<b>-If you just say the word--
-How insolent!</b>

609
00:43:09,068 --> 00:43:12,489
<b>The most senior member of the Royal Family
is His Majesty, not I.</b>

610
00:43:13,198 --> 00:43:15,825
<b>The remaining Royal Family and relatives
are to stay out of politics.</b>

611
00:43:15,909 --> 00:43:17,327
<b>How many times must I tell you?</b>

612
00:43:17,952 --> 00:43:19,704
<b>Get out of my house this instant!</b>

613
00:43:21,247 --> 00:43:23,625
<b>Your Highness, His Majesty is here.</b>

614
00:43:27,837 --> 00:43:28,963
<b>Your Majesty!</b>

615
00:43:30,089 --> 00:43:31,049
<b>Your Majesty.</b>

616
00:43:39,098 --> 00:43:41,267
<b>I hope I haven't caused
a misunderstanding, Your Majesty.</b>

617
00:43:42,268 --> 00:43:45,438
<b>They barged into my house unannounced.</b>

618
00:43:46,689 --> 00:43:47,982
<b>I won't get the wrong idea.</b>

619
00:43:50,777 --> 00:43:53,112
<b>How's everything with Se-jin?</b>

620
00:43:55,782 --> 00:43:58,576
<b>She finished her residency
and has started her fellowship.</b>

621
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:02,747
<b>She's still clumsy though.</b>

622
00:44:05,083 --> 00:44:05,917
<b>Se-jin</b>

623
00:44:06,918 --> 00:44:07,794
<b>will do a great job.</b>

624
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:11,714
<b>Will I</b>

625
00:44:13,508 --> 00:44:14,968
<b>do a great job too?</b>

626
00:44:17,136 --> 00:44:18,054
<b>Your Majesty.</b>

627
00:44:20,056 --> 00:44:21,140
<b>By any chance...</b>

628
00:44:24,894 --> 00:44:25,979
<b>Yes.</b>

629
00:44:26,854 --> 00:44:27,814
<b>Traitor Lee Lim</b>

630
00:44:29,232 --> 00:44:30,275
<b>is alive.</b>

631
00:44:30,942 --> 00:44:31,985
<b>And he hasn't aged a day.</b>

632
00:44:33,236 --> 00:44:35,905
<b>Because of that, I must leave
the palace again in a few days.</b>

633
00:44:37,365 --> 00:44:38,616
<b>I ought to track him down.</b>

634
00:44:39,784 --> 00:44:41,077
<b>And this rendezvous</b>

635
00:44:43,204 --> 00:44:44,956
<i><b>will not take place
in the Kingdom of Corea.</i></b>

636
00:44:46,958 --> 00:44:50,420
<b>Since you are second in line,
I need you to stay at the palace.</b>

637
00:44:51,629 --> 00:44:52,755
<b>For me</b>

638
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:54,841
<b>and for the Kingdom of Corea,</b>

639
00:44:55,925 --> 00:44:57,010
<b>you must stay safe.</b>

640
00:44:57,927 --> 00:45:02,223
<b>Your Majesty will track him down yourself?</b>

641
00:45:02,307 --> 00:45:05,059
<b>No, I cannot let you do that.</b>

642
00:45:06,686 --> 00:45:08,438
<b>I know what you're worried about.</b>

643
00:45:09,522 --> 00:45:12,525
<b>But I promise you
that I will protect myself.</b>

644
00:45:14,485 --> 00:45:16,779
<b>So you must do the same.</b>

645
00:45:17,697 --> 00:45:18,740
<b>Protect yourself.</b>

646
00:45:19,949 --> 00:45:21,117
<b>This is a King's Order.</b>

647
00:45:27,707 --> 00:45:28,666
<b>Understood.</b>

648
00:45:30,084 --> 00:45:31,919
<b>I will do so, Your Majesty.</b>

649
00:45:38,134 --> 00:45:39,093
<b>Okay, thank you.</b>

650
00:45:42,388 --> 00:45:43,848
<b>That vehicle, 7370, is registered</b>

651
00:45:44,682 --> 00:45:45,850
<b>under a missing person.</b>

652
00:45:45,933 --> 00:45:47,477
<b>Sit down and have some food first.</b>

653
00:45:53,316 --> 00:45:56,653
<b>It's common for punks who tail cops to use
cars with false registration.</b>

654
00:45:59,405 --> 00:46:00,323
<b>But I wonder</b>

655
00:46:01,407 --> 00:46:03,618
<b>if it could have been tailing you
for much longer.</b>

656
00:46:03,743 --> 00:46:05,203
<b>And why was it at the penitentiary?</b>

657
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:07,205
<b>Does anything come to mind?</b>

658
00:46:08,331 --> 00:46:09,415
<b>Tell me more about that.</b>

659
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:11,334
<b>About what?</b>

660
00:46:11,417 --> 00:46:14,212
<b>That place you went to.
The science fiction story.</b>

661
00:46:25,723 --> 00:46:26,557
<b>Well...</b>

662
00:46:27,558 --> 00:46:29,185
<b>I was there just for a day.</b>

663
00:46:30,812 --> 00:46:32,814
<b>That place is called the Kingdom of Corea,</b>

664
00:46:33,523 --> 00:46:34,899
<i><b>and it's not a divided country.</i></b>

665
00:46:35,858 --> 00:46:38,778
<i><b>So you can actually take the train
and go all the way up to Pyongyang.</i></b>

666
00:46:41,364 --> 00:46:42,990
<i><b>The capital city is Busan,</i></b>

667
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:47,161
<i><b>and there is a king
who is cherished by the people.</i></b>

668
00:46:48,913 --> 00:46:50,998
<i><b>I even went to our station.</i></b>

669
00:46:53,376 --> 00:46:55,962
<i><b>From the uniform to the vehicles,
everything was different,</i></b>

670
00:46:56,045 --> 00:46:57,714
<i><b>but I was still so happy to see everyone.</i></b>

671
00:46:58,339 --> 00:47:00,049
<i><b>I even saw Chief Park and Detective Shim.</i></b>

672
00:47:01,509 --> 00:47:03,970
<i><b>Even in that world, they were cops</i></b>

673
00:47:04,595 --> 00:47:05,888
<b>as if they were destined to be.</b>

674
00:47:08,516 --> 00:47:09,392
<b>Then</b>

675
00:47:10,435 --> 00:47:12,645
<b>I went to find you.</b>

676
00:47:14,272 --> 00:47:15,690
<b>But you weren't</b>

677
00:47:16,941 --> 00:47:17,817
<b>there.</b>

678
00:47:19,694 --> 00:47:22,780
<b>Neither at the station
nor in Pyeongchang-dong.</b>

679
00:47:24,031 --> 00:47:26,451
<b>Could you have inherited
the family business and become rich?</b>

680
00:47:27,076 --> 00:47:28,578
<b>Or maybe you live abroad or something.</b>

681
00:47:29,245 --> 00:47:30,121
<b>Lucky you.</b>

682
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:34,834
<b>I was here.</b>

683
00:47:37,044 --> 00:47:38,087
<b>What?</b>

684
00:47:40,339 --> 00:47:41,340
<b>Let's eat.</b>

685
00:47:41,507 --> 00:47:42,800
<b>We have to go somewhere.</b>

686
00:47:43,843 --> 00:47:44,677
<b>Where?</b>

687
00:47:56,230 --> 00:47:58,483
<b>LEE SANG-DO, JANG YEON-JI

<b>How do you</b>

693
00:48:16,793 --> 00:48:17,752
<b>know about this?</b>

694
00:48:19,170 --> 00:48:21,255
<b>Gyeong-ran gave me some reports

<b>She said it's top secret.</b>

696
00:48:24,842 --> 00:48:25,843
<b>So I took a peek at them</b>

697
00:48:27,678 --> 00:48:29,472
<b>to see what you're after</b>

698

<b>and where you're headed.</b>

699

<b>And this</b>

700
00:48:35,937 --> 00:48:36,771
<b>is where I ended up.</b>

701
00:48:41,234 --> 00:48:42,235
<b>I see.</b>

702
00:48:46,447 --> 00:48:47,532
<b>I can tell you</b>

<b>who this boy is.</b>

00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:55,665
<b>That's why we're here.</b>

706

<b>You said you couldn't find me

<b>I know why.</b>

708
00:49:05,091 --> 00:49:06,092
<b>Why?</b>

709
00:49:09,345 --> 00:49:10,888
<b>Do you know why I became a cop?</b>

710
00:49:14,976 --> 00:49:16,060
<b>I hoped</b>

711
00:49:17,687 --> 00:49:18,980
<b>I'd be holding a gun in my hand</b>

712
00:49:19,856 --> 00:49:21,399
<b>when someone asked me</b>

713

<b>to identify myself.</b>

714
00:49:27,613 --> 00:49:29,615

<b>Who are you?</b>

717

wasn't the Eun-sup we know,</b>

718
00:49:44,755 --> 00:49:48,384
<b>I called the name of the man

<b>His name?</b>

<b>You mean, that unidentified man</b>

721
00:49:53,806 --> 00:49:55,349
<b>told you his name?</b>

722
00:49:56,559 --> 00:49:57,393
<b>No,</b>

723
00:49:59,228 --> 00:50:00,271
<b>I just called his name.</b>

724

<b>The name that I remembered.</b>

725

<b>And I was right.</b>

727
00:50:13,993 --> 00:50:15,119
<b>It's because I was here...</b>

<b>In this world</b>

729

<b>anywhere in that world.</b>

732
00:50:31,052 --> 00:50:32,178
<b>Because of me, Kang Sin-jae.</b>

733
00:50:36,474 --> 00:50:37,725
<b>That is a fact.</b>

734
00:50:39,769 --> 00:50:40,937
<b>But as for who I really am...</b>

735
00:50:42,271 --> 00:50:43,189
<b>I'm not sure yet.</b>

736
00:50:54,408 --> 00:50:55,493

<b>here.</b>

738
00:50:58,996 --> 00:50:59,956

<b>all along.</b>

740
00:51:04,710 --> 00:51:05,920

<b>How did you know?</b>

744
00:51:54,635 --> 00:51:56,512
<b>You asked me to find

<b>Watch what you say.</b>

748
00:52:06,897 --> 00:52:08,983
<b>Seeing how cautious you are about this,</b>

749
00:52:10,443 --> 00:52:11,444
<b>it must be true.</b>

750

<b>Can KU find them?</b>

<b>Is your secretary's office
actually that capable?</b>

754
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:27,752
<b>Why do you need them?</b>

755
00:52:29,712 --> 00:52:33,924
<b>Do you want to catch the traitor

<b>Just tell me whether or not

<b>If I find them for you,
will I get out early?</b>

758

<b>How about the spring equinox?
I'll be out when spring begins.</b>

759
00:52:44,643 --> 00:52:47,480
<b>In this country, special pardon

760
00:52:48,564 --> 00:52:49,899
<b>An execution is more likely.</b>

761
00:52:50,816 --> 00:52:52,526
<b>How about Admiral Yi Sun-shin's birthday?</b>

762

<b>April?</b>

<b>That's a long way ahead.</b>

<b>Just rot here forever.</b>

00:53:27,019 --> 00:53:30,272
<i><b>They sing all night but no one's listening</i></b>

774
00:53:31,023 --> 00:53:33,484
<i><b>Even though no one is listening</i></b>

775
00:53:58,134 --> 00:54:00,761
<b>Prince Imperial Geum!</b>

776
00:54:01,387 --> 00:54:02,388
<b>You...</b>

777
00:54:04,849 --> 00:54:06,392
<b>You haven't aged one bit.</b>

778
00:54:06,475 --> 00:54:08,060
<b>Why are you surprised?</b>

779
00:54:08,686 --> 00:54:11,814
<b>You were the first person to find out
that I didn't die.</b>

780
00:54:12,398 --> 00:54:13,691
<b>You've known for the longest.</b>

781
00:54:15,734 --> 00:54:17,486
<b>Anybody there?</b>

782
00:54:17,736 --> 00:54:18,904
<b>I'm pretty sure</b>

783
00:54:23,033 --> 00:54:26,370
<b>I slew all of them on my way here.</b>

784
00:54:29,206 --> 00:54:30,499
<b>Don't be surprised.</b>

785
00:54:31,208 --> 00:54:34,336
<b>I came to collect
what's rightfully mine, Jong-in.</b>

786
00:54:40,676 --> 00:54:41,844
<b>Put it down.</b>

787
00:54:42,386 --> 00:54:44,388
<b>It's the King's ring,
and it does not belong to us.</b>

788
00:54:44,889 --> 00:54:46,432
<b>I was next in line to the throne.</b>

789
00:54:46,515 --> 00:54:48,225
<b>It's just that I was born to a concubine.</b>

790
00:54:49,602 --> 00:54:50,811
<b>I am the ring's rightful heir,</b>

791
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:55,691
<b>-so it belongs to me.
-Nonsense.</b>

792
00:54:56,734 --> 00:54:58,903
<b>We dare not covet that ring.</b>

793
00:55:00,613 --> 00:55:01,572
<b>"We"?</b>

794
00:55:08,037 --> 00:55:11,248
<b>You and I can never be "we."</b>

795
00:55:15,544 --> 00:55:20,507
<b>How can you identify with someone</b>

796
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:23,093
<b>who can kill you this instant?</b>

797
00:55:23,928 --> 00:55:24,845
<b>Such insolence!</b>

798
00:55:25,346 --> 00:55:29,350
<b>I will choke our dear nephew
just like this</b>

799
00:55:30,309 --> 00:55:32,561
<b>and take the Manpasikjeok from him.</b>

800
00:55:33,812 --> 00:55:39,818
<b>Then I'll be the only one
in possession of the Manpasikjeok.</b>

801
00:55:43,113 --> 00:55:48,077
<b>I don't know the extent of
what I'll be able to do</b>

802
00:55:49,411 --> 00:55:50,996
<b>when I'm in full possession of it.</b>

803
00:55:51,997 --> 00:55:53,332
<b>To make that happen,</b>

804
00:55:54,375 --> 00:55:59,588
<b>our dear nephew needs to suffer despair
and crumble away.</b>

805
00:56:01,298 --> 00:56:02,466
<b>And for that reason,</b>

806
00:56:02,967 --> 00:56:07,429
<b>I want him to lose
another person in his life.</b>

807
00:56:11,725 --> 00:56:14,770
<b>You, to be specific.</b>

808
00:56:36,208 --> 00:56:37,501
<b>Don't think this is unfair.</b>

809
00:56:38,335 --> 00:56:39,712
<b>You're smart,</b>

810
00:56:40,796 --> 00:56:42,256
<b>so I'm sure you saw this coming.</b>

811
00:57:16,415 --> 00:57:17,791
<b>Why aren't you surprised?</b>

812
00:57:18,375 --> 00:57:19,668
<b>Because I'm a curious person.</b>

813
00:57:21,670 --> 00:57:22,796
<b>I don't like seeing blood.</b>

814
00:57:23,839 --> 00:57:24,840
<b>Did you fight?</b>

815
00:57:25,591 --> 00:57:26,800
<b>I am in the middle of a fight.</b>

816
00:57:27,468 --> 00:57:28,677
<b>I still have a long way to go.</b>

817
00:57:31,930 --> 00:57:32,806
<b>What are you reading?</b>

818
00:57:34,892 --> 00:57:35,893
<i><b>King Arthur.</i></b>

819
00:57:37,019 --> 00:57:40,481
<b>It's a story about a man with noble blood
drawing a sword and becoming king.</b>

820
00:57:40,564 --> 00:57:42,691
<b>Only those with noble blood
can become king?</b>

821
00:57:43,942 --> 00:57:45,319
<b>That's a terrible story.</b>

822
00:57:46,362 --> 00:57:47,821
<b>Forget noble blood.</b>

823
00:57:48,322 --> 00:57:52,159
<b>The sword must be
drawn by those who know how to use it.</b>

824
00:57:52,242 --> 00:57:54,036
<b>What if a villain draws the sword?</b>

825
00:57:54,912 --> 00:57:56,080
<b>Someone who is not just.</b>

826
00:57:56,205 --> 00:57:58,248
<b>Justice doesn't make the sword.</b>

827
00:57:58,624 --> 00:58:01,251
<b>The sword decides what justice is.</b>

828
00:58:02,336 --> 00:58:05,547
<b>It seems that the things in your world
keep changing.</b>

829
00:58:07,049 --> 00:58:08,217
<b>Anyway, goodbye.</b>

830
00:58:08,759 --> 00:58:11,553
<b>I want to know how this story ends.</b>

831
00:58:23,816 --> 00:58:25,192
<b>Did you come alone?</b>

832
00:58:25,776 --> 00:58:26,944
<b>Are you expecting someone?</b>

833
00:58:33,075 --> 00:58:34,743
<b>I know the room service is pretty good,</b>

834
00:58:35,285 --> 00:58:37,371
<b>but I thought you might want
some home-cooked food.</b>

835
00:58:50,634 --> 00:58:52,803
<b>Since you're here,
I need to show you this.</b>

836
00:58:55,514 --> 00:58:57,224
<b>I gave this to your king.</b>

837
00:58:57,307 --> 00:59:01,770
<b>Right. His Majesty left it with me,
but I can't look up anything on it.</b>

838
00:59:04,773 --> 00:59:05,649
<b>I see.</b>

839
00:59:06,442 --> 00:59:07,943
<b>This is why he brought all that change.</b>

840
00:59:10,070 --> 00:59:12,781
<b>Why can't you look up anything?
Is there no Wi-Fi connection?</b>

841
00:59:13,574 --> 00:59:15,784
<b>You'll see why.</b>

842
00:59:16,410 --> 00:59:18,203
<b>I can't even say it.</b>

843
00:59:29,965 --> 00:59:31,925
<i><b>Want to see what I've been looking up?</i></b>

844
00:59:32,801 --> 00:59:34,011
<i><b>A king never</i></b>

845
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:36,054
<i><b>leaves any traces.</i></b>

846
00:59:37,431 --> 00:59:41,018
<i><b>Are you working now
or just doing day-to-day stuff?</i></b>

847
00:59:41,894 --> 00:59:43,770
<i><b>To me, every moment in your world</i></b>

848
00:59:45,022 --> 00:59:46,023
<i><b>was scandalous.</i></b>

849
00:59:47,357 --> 00:59:48,775
<i><b>Because of Lieutenant Jeong Tae-eul.</i></b>

850
00:59:53,447 --> 00:59:56,366
<b>I'm amazed that you didn't delete this
all this time.</b>

851
01:00:01,497 --> 01:00:03,665
<b>All deleted. You can now use this
to look things up.</b>

852
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,376
<b>I thought you'd want to keep it.</b>

853
01:00:08,795 --> 01:00:09,922
<b>I'll remember it.</b>

854
01:00:11,924 --> 01:00:14,593
<b>We shouldn't leave evidence, you know.</b>

855
01:00:15,594 --> 01:00:19,848
<b>We need to make sure those from your world
don't leave any traces in this world.</b>

856
01:00:22,392 --> 01:00:23,560
<b>You know what?</b>

857
01:00:25,062 --> 01:00:27,981
<b>Besides His Majesty himself,
you're the only one</b>

858
01:00:28,065 --> 01:00:31,026
<b>who can delete what His Majesty wrote.</b>

859
01:00:35,072 --> 01:00:36,406
<b>Can you handle it?</b>

860
01:00:37,783 --> 01:00:40,160
<b>-Handle what?
-Everything that will happen</b>

861
01:00:40,744 --> 01:00:42,037
<b>after Traitor Lee Lim is caught.</b>

862
01:00:43,288 --> 01:00:45,707
<b>You two belong to different worlds.</b>

863
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:48,502
<b>Will you travel back and forth?</b>

864
01:00:50,295 --> 01:00:52,214
<b>His Majesty is the King of a country.</b>

865
01:00:52,839 --> 01:00:54,758
<b>He needs to be with someone
who will be his queen.</b>

866
01:00:56,009 --> 01:00:57,678
<b>Can you abandon everything you have here</b>

867
01:00:59,388 --> 01:01:01,974
<b>and become the Queen
of the Kingdom of Corea?</b>

868
01:01:03,976 --> 01:01:06,186
<b>And keep the two worlds a secret</b>

869
01:01:08,355 --> 01:01:09,314

870
01:02:02,159 --> 01:02:03,118

871
01:02:04,911 --> 01:02:06,413
<b>Your Majesty...</b>

872
01:02:11,418 --> 01:02:12,502
<b>What's the matter?</b>

873
01:02:16,423 --> 01:02:17,341
<b>Buyeong...</b>

874
01:02:18,717 --> 01:02:20,802
<b>His Highness Prince Buyeong...</b>

875
01:02:24,056 --> 01:02:27,976
<b>His Highness Prince Buyeong...</b>

876
01:03:33,041 --> 01:03:34,793
<b>Ma'am!</b>

877
01:03:35,168 --> 01:03:36,878

878
01:03:38,839 --> 01:03:41,007
<b>Ma'am.</b>

879
01:03:42,134 --> 01:03:43,051
<b>Ma'am.</b>

880
01:03:44,678 --> 01:03:47,180
<b>-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!</b>

881
01:04:13,290 --> 01:04:14,458
<b>Earlier today,</b>

882
01:04:16,752 --> 01:04:17,794
<b>it was very sunny.</b>

883
01:04:20,338 --> 01:04:21,715
<b>Because it was so sunny,</b>

884
01:04:22,883 --> 01:04:24,009
<b>I wondered</b>

885
01:04:25,677 --> 01:04:27,053
<b>if you would have been able to</b>

886
01:04:28,696 --> 01:04:32,658
<b>gather your strength

887
01:04:35,312 --> 01:04:37,481
<b>So I rushed home.</b>

888
01:06:01,815 --> 01:06:02,774
<b>Hey.</b>

889
01:06:05,652 --> 01:06:06,778
<b>How have you been?</b>

890
01:06:12,617 --> 01:06:13,451
<b>It took you</b>

891
01:06:14,619 --> 01:06:15,829
<b>a while this time.</b>

892
01:06:20,542 --> 01:06:22,002
<b>Because I had to come from far away.</b>

893
01:06:26,548 --> 01:06:27,674
<b>I realized that</b>

894
01:06:30,260 --> 01:06:32,095
<b>I never even gave you a single flower.</b>

895
01:06:33,471 --> 01:06:34,389
<b>That's why</b>

896
01:06:36,808 --> 01:06:38,226
<b>I crossed the universe for you.</b>

897
01:07:11,259 --> 01:07:12,385

898
01:07:17,057 --> 01:07:18,433

901
01:07:30,111 --> 01:07:31,738
