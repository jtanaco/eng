1
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:01,090
I saw that Leon was still there.

2
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,560
I guess someone kept taking care of it.

3
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:11,500
I wonder how that happened.

4
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:15,940
Actually, that's not Leon.

5
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:17,960
Right?

6
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:20,070
No wonder.

7
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,240
I planted it not long ago.

8
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,800
On purpose.

9
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:29,120
Right here.

10
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,020
I forgot.

11
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,800
What this place was.

12
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,570
It's the asyli,

13
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,320
so no one can see us or find us,

14
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:05,540
so just for a while.

15
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:29,240
I was afraid of being held back by the past,

16
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:33,480
so I kept walking forward without looking back,

17
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:38,490
but I realized that I was always at this place.

18
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,680
Maybe...

19
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,900
I had been walking here all this time.

20
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:51,130
Now, my legs hurt,

21
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:57,070
and I just want to stay today.

22
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,640
Because if we're here,

23
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:07,650
we will be okay.

24
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:41,810
(Episode 9)

25
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:50,550
I have to go now.

26
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,360
Okay. Sleep well, Ji Su.

27
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,330
Get home safely.

28
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,500
Do you want some ramyeon?

29
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,830
Do you not eat ramyeon now?

30
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:32,670
Not much.

31
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:36,800
So people in your neighborhood really don't eat this.

32
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,870
You must've lost half your joy in life.

33
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:43,340
Is that so?

34
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:47,340
- You won't eat that? - What?

35
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,550
No.

36
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,860
Eating ramyeon and drinking coffee in a convenience store.

37
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,090
It's just like a date the youth go on.

38
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:05,900
If we speak like the youth do,

39
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,460
does that make us a couple?

40
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:18,880
We might...

41
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,820
get stoned.

42
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,890
I'm not afraid of being stoned,

43
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:35,790
but if we get stoned, it will hurt others too.

44
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:39,720
I'll get stoned for us both.

45
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:45,140
It's not like you're Iron Man.

46
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:48,400
You can't take it all.

47
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:52,150
I can. Because I have you.

48
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:57,390
You are my Iron Man suit.

49
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:03,280
If I'm your suit, doesn't that mean I'm the one who gets stoned?

50
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:06,830
Is that what it means?

51
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:15,030
He's lucid 20 percent of the time.

52
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:18,400
He's a kind, mild-mannered gentleman 50 percent of the time.

53
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:21,970
The rest of the time, he's a sick old man...

54
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:23,950
who is too tired to talk.

55
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,340
It must be so hard on you.

56
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:32,250
It was my dad who first taught me to play the piano.

57
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,710
"Child on the Island".

58
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,410
Your father played the piano too?

59
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,650
Slowly, with one hand.

60
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:45,020
I never understood him in my life,

61
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,860
but these days I do.

62
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,570
He was like a tiger for over 50 years,

63
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,770
and now he's a kitten.

64
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:55,900
He must be so flustered when he's lucid.

65
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:58,080
So...

66
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,880
I get it when he throws things and yells at me.

67
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,210
Just because I get it...

68
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,390
doesn't mean I just take it.

69
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:09,820
I get angry too.

70
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,920
Listening to old songs on the radio is her only hobby.

71
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:21,030
Your mother was a beauty.

72
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:23,290
Last time, her radio was broken,

73
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:25,710
so I sang a song for her myself.

74
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,600
- Did you? - Yes.

75
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,970
What did you sing?

76
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:33,970
"Because I Love You".

77
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:38,980
Did you sing well?

78
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:40,390
Not really.

79
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,210
I just sang, ignoring the beat and notes.

80
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,390
Sing it for me too.

81
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:49,200
I can't sing.

82
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,500
Liar.

83
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,640
I know how well you can sing.

84
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:58,030
That was back then. I forgot how.

85
00:07:58,810 --> 00:07:59,840
Did you really?

86
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,140
Yes.

87
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,380
Was my head heavy?

88
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:42,150
It was light.

89
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:44,780
That's not a compliment.

90
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:48,980
Go on inside.

91
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,260
I'll really go now.

92
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,570
Who is it?

93
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:10,440
Mr. Kang the secretary.

94
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,340
What's going on?

95
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:18,240
Up there.

96
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:23,790
Over here.

97
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,420
- Is this the one? - That's it.

98
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,750
This is the newest and best door lock.

99
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,330
Fingerprint access, tampering alarm,

100
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:33,960
waterproof, dust-proof, earthquake-proof.

101
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,590
Even a mob of thieves can't break in.

102
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,220
(Vice-president Han Jae Hyun)

103
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,470
Hi, Ji Su.

104
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,340
The people here won't listen to me.

105
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,580
You tell them to leave.

106
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:54,510
They won't leave until the police drag them away.

107
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,210
- Jae Hyun. - They're doing it for me.

108
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:58,590
Not you.

109
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:00,960
I want to sleep in peace.

110
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,560
You must eat well if you're to stay up all night.

111
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:13,390
Do you disapprove?

112
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,090
Pardon?

113
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:17,070
It's not for work or family matters.

114
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,780
I keep making you do things that people ridicule.

115
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,780
That?

116
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:25,600
It must be hard physically and psychologically too.

117
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:30,010
I bet I'm the only person in all of Korea...

118
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:33,690
who knows the life you lived.

119
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:37,690
It's not Ms. Yoon, your wife, or the chairman.

120
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:41,930
I know more than anyone about the life you led so far.

121
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:46,260
I'm on your side. Without question or condition.

122
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,590
You've grown up.

123
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,600
I always was tall,

124
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,710
but you're just taller.

125
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,910
You even talk back at me now?

126
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:57,340
I apologize.

127
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,140
Thanks.

128
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,090
(Convalescent Ward)

129
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:25,360
(Celebrate with your family)

130
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,580
It's "Child on the Island".

131
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:37,320
My daughter played the piano well.

132
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:40,980
What did you say, Dad?

133
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:47,330
My daughter played the piano well, ma'am.

134
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:50,250
Hello.

135
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:54,040
Yes. Hello.

136
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,460
What's that?

137
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,810
It wouldn't fit in your home,

138
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:04,740
and I knew you'd refuse it.

139
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,180
So I donated it here.

140
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,470
I said it would be good for the patients,

141
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,380
and the director accepted it.

142
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:15,820
I squeezed out what little creativity I had.

143
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:17,590
Does it look okay?

144
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:19,880
It's not okay. It must've cost a fortune.

145
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,030
I asked them to let anyone play it.

146
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,170
That's what I said,

147
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,170
but I hope you play.

148
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,490
Give it a go.

149
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,910
Your father's memory might return.

150
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:40,640
So, will you be detained or not?

151
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,550
I wouldn't know.

152
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,240
Are you speaking in rhymes?

153
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,690
Is that a challenge?

154
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:50,090
Not only are you on the verge of being detained

155
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:52,480
You were sued for something you did five years ago

156
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,460
How are you so relaxed?

157
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,460
Man, yes.

158
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,890
What on earth are you doing?

159
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,540
- My gosh. - You wouldn't know.

160
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,630
Then what? Should I pray?

161
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,170
To avoid being detained?

162
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:08,870
You would be really crazy if you were in your right mind.

163
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,640
I'm in a great mood these days.

164
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,810
You're crazy.

165
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,780
Gosh.

166
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:18,880
Hey.

167
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:22,750
Look at you. You are crazy.

168
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,220
- Hey. - What?

169
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,350
What time do you get off work?

170
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:28,720
Do you want to have a drink?

171
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,760
I can get off right now.

172
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:33,330
Is this room soundproof?

173
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,540
Soundproof? Why would you ask?

174
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:39,100
Can I spend the night here?

175
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:41,130
Hang on.

176
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:43,870
At night, in a soundproof...

177
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,180
You fool. You and Ji Su?

178
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:50,510
Gosh, you have an imaginative mind.

179
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:52,690
Too bad it's in the gutter.

180
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:54,850
Hey, what are you saying?

181
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,530
Tell me honestly and I'll let you stay!

182
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:00,120
What? How dare you?

183
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,500
(911 Ambulance)

184
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:40,620
Can you spare me some time in the evening?

185
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,620
Ji Su.

186
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,890
I'll go back to you.

187
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,740
I won't stop,

188
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:01,900
and I won't look back.

189
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,650
These past few days,

190
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:17,110
until today,

191
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,850
I felt as if I was in a movie.

192
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:26,030
Out of all we did,

193
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:29,040
this was my best scene.

194
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:35,930
The longer I walk with you,

195
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:39,050
the heavier my footsteps become.

196
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,670
Everything you taught me,

197
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,020
I kept in my heart.

198
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,990
So I wouldn't feel ashamed...

199
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:51,350
if I ever met you again.

200
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,560
I'll take a path...

201
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,730
where I can stand proudly in front of anyone.

202
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,240
I won't deceive anyone anymore.

203
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:05,600
I have things to sort out,

204
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,900
so it might take some time,

205
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,050
but I will go back to you.

206
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:06,270
(Chief Prosecutor Kim Hak Cheol)

207
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,070
Everyone's so busy, first thing in the morning.

208
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,400
- Let's begin. - Okay.

209
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:20,790
How far is Jae Hyun taking this?

210
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,560
According to Chief Prosecutor Kim,

211
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,680
the prosecutor got a search warrant according to...

212
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,920
the Real-name Transaction Law, Capital Market Law,

213
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,390
and International Tax Collection Law.

214
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,030
Other than the dividends sent to the borrowed-name accounts...

215
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:38,270
I believe your slush fund too...

216
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:42,370
How does that fool know about that too?

217
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:45,810
He gathered information when he was in Strategy and Planning.

218
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:47,820
That's why I wanted to...

219
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,380
If only it hadn't been for Seo Kyung...

220
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,800
It was definitely him who alerted the press about...

221
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,300
the borrowed-name accounts.

222
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:05,160
I told him to do time,

223
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,860
and he's preparing to pay tax.

224
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:09,300
He's planning to take those shares.

225
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:10,830
I apologize, sir.

226
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:16,780
The best offense is the best defense.

227
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:21,320
You only win a fight when your opponent is down and beaten.

228
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:24,490
You don't win if they take a stand.

229
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:30,150
Find a ring to fight him in.

230
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,790
Not where he wants to meet us,

231
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:37,820
but where we can summon him to.

232
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,200
There is something...

233
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:44,930
he is spending a lot of time on.

234
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:28,720
You only watch "Love Letter" or this movie.

235
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:30,840
I watched it.

236
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,220
"Days of Being Wild" is not fun at all.

237
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:43,700
I plan to get rid of this room.

238
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,770
Should I turn it into...

239
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:49,570
a dressing room or a wine bar?

240
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:55,170
We ended up like this because you spend...

241
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,170
too much time here reminiscing.

242
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,280
Even before I met Ji Su again,

243
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:02,910
our marriage was over.

244
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,450
I was inattentive,

245
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,020
and you dated another man.

246
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,700
When my fight with Father is done,

247
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:20,160
one of us will pay the price.

248
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,130
Whether it's me or Father,

249
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:25,510
it'll be hard on you.

250
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,630
It's all in the past.

251
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,400
Must it end this way?

252
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,900
Being abused and discarded...

253
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:37,570
is the natural order for the likes of me.

254
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:44,650
You're not responsible at all for this fight.

255
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:48,060
But still, you will get hurt.

256
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:51,700
What is the best I can do for you?

257
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:55,540
I'm still wondering.

258
00:23:57,930 --> 00:23:59,970
I want only one thing.

259
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:04,780
I'm sorry but...

260
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:07,310
I can't divorce you.

261
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,380
I can't help but weep.

262
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:15,290
That woman should weep too.

263
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,990
If I can't have my love,

264
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:21,800
she can't either.

265
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,570
I may seem like a monster,

266
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,470
but my love was love too.

267
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,150
Are you Ms. Yoon Ji Su?

268
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,060
What do you want?

269
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:57,060
Could you spare me some time?

270
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,390
My chairman wishes to see you.

271
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:01,770
Your chairman?

272
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:11,750
You look alike.

273
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:15,640
What do you mean?

274
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,020
Chief Prosecutor Yoon Hyung Gu's...

275
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,490
only living child.

276
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:24,760
His weakness.

277
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:30,390
The world is a small place,

278
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:33,090
Ms. Yoon Ji Su.

279
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:36,930
Did your father never mention me?

280
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:44,130
Until that incident, we were very close.

281
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,320
Did you know your father wanted to be a politician?

282
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,290
That requires money,

283
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:55,060
and businessmen require connections with prosecutors.

284
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:58,460
We sometimes met for a drink...

285
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,620
and to play golf.

286
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:02,890
He was so proud that...

287
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:04,920
his daughter went to Seoul National University.

288
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:07,300
Was that you?

289
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:12,010
You can't have asked to see me to talk about the past.

290
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:18,810
I'm smiling as I speak, so you might get me wrong.

291
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:22,640
I don't always smile.

292
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:28,410
If it hadn't been for that accident, he'd have gotten into politics...

293
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:31,580
and become an assemblyman and prime minister.

294
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,800
Why is the daughter of such a noble man...

295
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:37,700
seeing my son-in-law?

296
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:45,310
Do you need money?

297
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:49,170
Then say so. I knew your father...

298
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,140
and can give you a certain amount.

299
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:01,290
I warned my son-in-law many times.

300
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:04,080
When it comes to my daughter,

301
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:08,620
I find it impossible to control my temper.

302
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,570
This is a warning of sorts,

303
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:16,830
so it would be best for you to act wisely.

304
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,790
(Murderous Company)

305
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:33,580
(I report the brutality of Hyung Sung!)

306
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:51,900
How long was he there for?

307
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:53,430
Pardon? Who do you mean?

308
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:55,540
Lee Se Hun's client.

309
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:57,710
That man?

310
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:00,780
It was shortly before you were imprisoned.

311
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,840
It has been a bit over four years.

312
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:07,140
He's the person who threw the raw eggs at you.

313
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:11,220
(I report the brutality of Hyung Sung!)

314
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,120
Sir.

315
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:18,320
I looked into the prosecutor.

316
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,300
Did you know that was his father?

317
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:21,770
Who?

318
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:27,310
Kwon Hyuk Soo.

319
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,830
I see. That Kwon Hyuk Soo.

320
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,520
You can't just barge in here without making an appointment.

321
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:42,290
When you negotiated last year with the union,

322
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:43,960
you promised to raise 20 percent of the basic salary...

323
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,960
and 50 percent of our bonus...

324
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,800
and to give permanent positions to 50 percent of contract workers.

325
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:50,420
The terms were all settled,

326
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:52,800
but none of that had come true over the past year.

327
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,240
And we didn't even get to start negotiating for this year's demands.

328
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:57,660
I requested to see you multiple times,

329
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:59,240
but you didn't get back to me at all.

330
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:02,040
Not giving you an answer was the position we took. But...

331
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:05,510
I'm sure there was a precedent to execute those terms.

332
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:07,280
That if the economy gets bad,

333
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,250
the negotiation won't be valid?

334
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,140
The company suffered a blow because the company invested...

335
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:14,410
in the Australian steel business without analyzing the demands.

336
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:16,880
Is that our fault?

337
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,120
When you guys decided on that, you didn't discuss it with us.

338
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,800
The management has the sole right...

339
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,620
to decide on the investments the company makes.

340
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:25,860
It's not to be negotiated with the labor union.

341
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,920
Are you telling us that you call all the shots,

342
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,270
but we'll pay for your consequences?

343
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:31,710
Because of that investment, the entire company is struggling.

344
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:35,570
For now, until the shipbuilding industry and economy get better,

345
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:37,480
we must just hang in there and bear it through.

346
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,250
We're the last ones to enjoy the fruit,

347
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:41,070
but we're the first ones to suffer from the fall.

348
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,980
Is that the motto of Hyung Sung Group?

349
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:45,340
Think whatever you want.

350
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:52,490
It's so easy for you people to say to hang in there.

351
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:55,620
But to us, it's a matter of survival.

352
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:02,160
As it is a matter of survival, you must decide yourself...

353
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:04,130
before someone else does it for you.

354
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,070
Back then, Han Jae Hyun was the director...

355
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:08,810
of Strategy and Planning Department.

356
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:10,630
Based on what I have gathered,

357
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,840
right after Hyuk Soo met with Han Jae Hyun,

358
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,720
he declared the union failed to negotiate...

359
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,520
and decided to go on a strike.

360
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:20,020
But that strike didn't last a day.

361
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,320
Right.

362
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,080
From what I can conclude from this, I believe...

363
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,820
Hyuk Soo had been taken advantage of by the company.

364
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:28,230
What?

365
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:30,530
The strike didn't proceed as planned...

366
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:33,800
because Hyuk Soo got a new set of terms from the company.

367
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,070
That the company would give them the raise as promised...

368
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:39,770
and other demands would be met.

369
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:43,810
He persuaded the union members with the offer...

370
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,010
and ended the strike.

371
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:47,640
And they dropped all the charges against the management.

372
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:52,020
But afterward, the company had a change of heart.

373
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:57,320
The employees who led the strike were terminated.

374
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:00,580
And even the employees who were involved were separated...

375
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,460
and sent to other subsidiaries.

376
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,660
And when that happened, Hyuk Soo was the only one who stayed.

377
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,360
And he even got promoted to the unit leader.

378
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:14,930
But it's obvious how the people who left and stayed...

379
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,140
treated him.

380
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:22,070
Hyuk Soo.

381
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:25,020
My poor baby.

382
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,720
We must make him pay...

383
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:31,760
for this tragedy...

384
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:34,350
as he had the biggest part in this.

385
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:39,230
Young Min, is everything okay?

386
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:41,590
Yes.

387
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:44,270
But your grades have been dropping.

388
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:45,830
I'm sorry.

389
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:48,070
If you are, study harder.

390
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,630
Okay.

391
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:51,600
By the way,

392
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:54,210
are you interested in studying abroad?

393
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,610
Abroad?

394
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:58,220
This company runs a lot of good programs.

395
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:01,080
They select students with good grades and send them abroad.

396
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,490
And this time, you were selected.

397
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,530
But my grades have been going down.

398
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:08,500
It has nothing to do with your...

399
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,890
You used to get good grades before. Right?

400
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:14,730
Wouldn't that cost a lot of money?

401
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:16,390
If you're willing to go...

402
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:20,400
It won't cost a thing.

403
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:21,900
That company...

404
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:24,710
will pay for your education and living expenses.

405
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,520
Yes, Young Min.

406
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:38,020
I got selected for a scholarship program to study abroad.

407
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,060
Study abroad?

408
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,960
It's a scholarship program from Hyung Sung Group.

409
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:46,360
Hyung Sung Group sponsors scholarship students.

410
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,360
It will be favorable when he applies for jobs at Hyung Sung Group.

411
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:52,740
But don't they usually give that out to college students?

412
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:54,510
Right.

413
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:57,510
That's why I was very surprised that Young Min was selected.

414
00:32:57,810 --> 00:33:01,100
That just means that Young Min is that much distinguished.

415
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:03,480
I see.

416
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:06,880
I'll tell you more about it when you come down this weekend.

417
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:09,650
Okay.

418
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:11,610
- Right? - My gosh.

419
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:13,420
- You look much better. - Bye.

420
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:16,150
- You should tell us how. - My goodness.

421
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:29,280
- Is that him? - I heard about them.

422
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:31,710
- Are you serious? - Is that true?

423
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:33,280
- Really? - I heard they're having an affair.

424
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:35,570
- My gosh, I had no idea. - They are having an affair.

425
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:38,070
- They shouldn't do that. - My gosh.

426
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:39,680
- I can't believe her. - How could she?

427
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,820
- I know, right? - Unbelievable.

428
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:46,320
- How could they do this at school? - This is awful.

429
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,420
She must be ashamed.

430
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,390
Young Min.

431
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:54,300
I have a bad feeling about it.

432
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,800
About what?

433
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:58,570
The scholarship program.

434
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:00,970
Why?

435
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:05,300
There are no free lunches in life...

436
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,580
except for lunches from me.

437
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:10,350
But once you start eating meals outside,

438
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:12,410
you'd have to pay for the food.

439
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:15,320
So it doesn't matter whether they are mere feelings or things,

440
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,050
if they are too much,

441
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,030
it makes you wonder how you are going to...

442
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,220
return the favor.

443
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:26,030
I'm just worried that you might get a stomachache...

444
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:28,470
when you have to worry about how you'll pay for the meals.

445
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,930
It's disappointing, right?

446
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:35,700
A bit.

447
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:39,080
But I knew it wouldn't work anyway.

448
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:40,910
Why not?

449
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,870
You can't come with me.

450
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:47,080
Why would I go with you?

451
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,950
People study abroad by themselves.

452
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:52,330
Because I'll always be glued to you.

453
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:09,030
- Dad. - Yes?

454
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:10,240
Let's go home now.

455
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,330
Okay.

456
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:23,160
Aren't you cold?

457
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:27,450
It's really cold for me.

458
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:32,370
When I go out to the street for the strike,

459
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:35,120
I try to layer up as much as I can,

460
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:38,070
but it's still very cold.

461
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:59,990
My son didn't commit suicide.

462
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,690
The company...

463
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:04,430
and Vice-president Han Jae Hyun made him end his own life.

464
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,260
According to Mr. Kwon,

465
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:08,200
the father of the late deputy speaker...

466
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,030
from Hyung Sung Steel's labor union who died five years ago,

467
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:11,730
Vice-president Han Jae Hyun...

468
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:13,370
who was the director of the Strategy and Planning Department...

469
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:18,110
(Murderous Company! I report the brutality of Hyung Sung!)

470
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:28,620
Are you trying to confirm it?

471
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:31,490
I'll show you...

472
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,490
what Han Jae Hyun did.

473
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:38,230
If that's true, he will face an appropriate punishment.

474
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:40,800
I don't plan to cover it up and side with him.

475
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:44,470
I wonder if you'll say that after when this is all over.

476
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,800
Are you targeting him because of me?

477
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:52,610
Han Jae Hyun was in the middle of that case.

478
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:55,910
And he had the biggest deciding power regarding the union matters.

479
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:57,410
He called the shots.

480
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:02,550
To be honest, I did start this because of you.

481
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:08,120
But once I got started, I began to develop an interest in Han Jae Hyun.

482
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:14,030
I found more stories along with this one.

483
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:17,770
And the main genre of the stories is crime.

484
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:26,380
Did you expect that the arrest warrant would be dismissed?

485
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:28,110
Are you the actual owner of the accounts under borrowed names?

486
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:29,580
What about the accusation regarding the slush fund?

487
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:32,380
- Give us a comment. - How do you feel right now?

488
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:37,620
Why? Why on earth do you want to drink at a place like this?

489
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:39,520
Why? Are you really broke?

490
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,490
I came here a few days ago, and it was nice.

491
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:43,660
Drinks here are much better, but cheaper.

492
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:45,730
All right. Then,

493
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:49,770
you should order eels or chicken gizzards at least.

494
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:51,570
What is this? Look at this empty table.

495
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:54,040
You know that I go for the food, not the drinks.

496
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,510
Sure thing. I'll turn this table into a buffet.

497
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:57,570
That's right!

498
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:00,880
- Ma'am. - Turn this into a buffet.

499
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:08,050
It makes me wonder if you guys ended up like this...

500
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,750
because of the era you were in.

501
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:13,720
What if...

502
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:16,960
you didn't have to study hard?

503
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:20,830
What if you didn't have to protest like the 80s?

504
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,000
Music, movies, and books. You name it.

505
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:27,470
Our era was the golden era.

506
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,870
Right.

507
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:31,040
I keep trying to figure it out,

508
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:34,810
but I still think it was a great era. You know?

509
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:36,350
But...

510
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:40,620
it was cruel as awesome as it had been.

511
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,020
It took away a lot of good people.

512
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:48,490
And it turned a good man into a bad one too.

513
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,840
Hello?

514
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:12,050
This is Kim Mi Hwa. Do you remember me?

515
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:15,620
Yes. Hello, Mi Hwa. Have you been well?

516
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:18,290
Of course.

517
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:19,390
What about you?

518
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:21,920
I've been well too. But what is this about?

519
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:24,130
I heard from Sun Hee.

520
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:26,460
Can you play the keyboard for us too?

521
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,130
The keyboard?

522
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,300
There's a separate labor union in the supermarket, not the company.

523
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:33,240
And we also have a culture festival.

524
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:37,610
Of course, I should go. I have your back.

525
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:39,080
Okay.

526
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,750
Then, I'll see you tomorrow. Okay.

527
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:22,950
- Jae Hyun. Wake up. - What?

528
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:24,020
What?

529
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:26,820
You're here.

530
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:34,330
Wait. How much have you been drinking?

531
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:39,100
Dong Jin kept feeding me drinks. Dong Jin gave me those drinks.

532
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,100
You should go home. Why did you come here?

533
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:42,840
Going home was tough.

534
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:47,010
It bothers me that an old man who always protests...

535
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:49,650
in the same spot stopped coming.

536
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:53,020
And it also bothers me that his son died...

537
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:54,720
because he had been wrong.

538
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:59,860
And I'm worried about my mother too.

539
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:06,600
I'm also worried about her stupid son.

540
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,630
I'm worried about Seo Kyung.

541
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,600
And Jun Seo too.

542
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:24,180
I'm worried about you...

543
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:28,250
and Young Min.

544
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:33,360
My gosh, I decided to go back to you.

545
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:38,660
But I keep seeing obstacles on my way to you.

546
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:42,600
It's because I live in a tough world.

547
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:48,270
The path coming to me is bumpy and rocky.

548
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,340
So coming to me...

549
00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:55,740
will be very hard.

550
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:09,290

I need Mr. Kang's number.

554
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:45,490
He's not a man, but a package.

555
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,360
I'm not inviting him in to seduce him.

556
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:50,270
This is beyond my control.

557
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:53,100
I'll lock the door and go to sleep.

558

Next time, I'll let you freeze to death on the street.

between Jun Seo's father and Young Min's mom?

564

- Isn't that obvious? - Right?

565
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:40,870
I could tell there was definitely something going on that day.

566

That day?

567

Listen. I saw them when they came to school last weekend.

568
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:48,240
I could feel the intense gaze between each other.

569
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,880
They did that even at school?

570

My gosh, they've got some nerves!

571

- Yes? - It's me, Jun Woo.

572
00:47:11,890 --> 00:47:13,230
- My gosh. - Gosh, it hits the spot.

573
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:15,600
I couldn't say hi properly earlier.

574
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:17,030
You look great.

575
00:47:17,370 --> 00:47:18,430
- Really? - Yes.

576
00:47:18,430 --> 00:47:21,340
Are you dating a guy? You're glowing so radiantly.

577
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:22,670
Is it botox?

578

What are you talking about? She was always pretty.

579
00:47:25,170 --> 00:47:26,940
By the way, you looked incredibly pretty...

- That's right. - Yes, since you're pretty...

582
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:32,750
and have delicate fingers.

583
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:34,780
Gosh, I used to play the keyboard too,

584
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:37,490
but I kept pressing two keys, so I quit.

This is so delicious.

- Where are you going? - Who else but her boyfriend?

599

You can't do that on your birthday. We need to eat together.

600
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:30,530
We can eat now.

601

Dad said to wait until dinnertime.

604
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:36,370
So we didn't even buy a cake yet.

Just come back in time.

It's your birthday. How can we eat without you?

You're never home these days too.

609
00:49:44,510 --> 00:49:47,120
All right. I'll try to be early.

This may seem like a lie, but Jun Woo took a leave.

644

Then you can drive yourself.

645

This may seem even more like a lie,

You live alone, eat alone,

00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:43,810
My daughter will be cold out in the rain.

668
00:54:46,510 --> 00:54:47,820
Ji Young!

669
00:54:48,450 --> 00:54:49,820
Honey!

670
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:01,130
Ji Su.

671
00:55:03,670 --> 00:55:04,800
Excuse me.

672
00:55:19,410 --> 00:55:21,120
Your mother is a great cook.

673
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:25,390
Doesn't it look like I made it?

674
00:55:25,390 --> 00:55:26,520
No, it doesn't.

675
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:30,090
You know everything.

676
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:37,970
You're so much darker now.

677
00:55:38,870 --> 00:55:40,170
Is it difficult here?

678
00:55:40,370 --> 00:55:43,570
I'm used to running around at school, so it's fine.

679
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:46,110
By the way, are you sure...

680
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:48,540
it's okay to be here on your birthday?

681
00:55:50,410 --> 00:55:51,480
We have breaking news.

682
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:54,020
Another unprecedented accident has happened.

683
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:57,620
This afternoon, a popular department store in Seoul collapsed.

684
00:55:57,820 --> 00:56:00,760
Fire trucks and ambulances are currently on-site,

685
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:03,260
with rescue operations underway.

686
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:05,630
We're going to the department store to fix the clock today.

687
00:56:05,830 --> 00:56:07,330
Should we get the strawberry cake there?

688
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:14,440
The death rate is expected to be substantially high.

689
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:16,240
We will now contact a reporter on-site...

690
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:18,440
to look into details.

691
00:56:35,490 --> 00:56:36,490
Ji Su!

692
00:56:37,190 --> 00:56:38,860
Hold on a moment.

693
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:41,560
We're not sure yet, so...

694
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:44,570
Dad told me to come to his office right away.

695
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:47,740
He won't say anything else,

696
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:49,540
but he said to come.

697
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:52,640
But still... It's going to be fine. It will be all right.

698
00:56:53,210 --> 00:56:55,180
I should still hurry up and go.

699
00:56:56,340 --> 00:56:57,510
I'm sorry.

700
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:20,740
I'm sorry, sir.

701
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:24,240
Please let me go out for a moment.

702
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:25,270
Go back inside.

703
00:57:26,370 --> 00:57:28,510
Please, sir. Let me go out.

704
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:30,250
It will be considered desertion if you go out.

705
00:57:32,510 --> 00:57:34,320
Then I will do so, sir.

706
00:57:35,850 --> 00:57:38,690
Just this... Let go.

707
00:57:38,690 --> 00:57:39,890
Let go of me!

708
00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:42,120
Ji Su!

709
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:45,190
Let go of me...

710
00:57:58,840 --> 00:57:59,870
Ladies and gentlemen,

711
00:58:00,070 --> 00:58:02,140
our train will be stopping momentarily...

712
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:03,710
in order to maintain distance.

713
00:58:04,450 --> 00:58:06,980
We apologize for the inconvenience.

714
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:29,340
What do I do...

715
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:49,360
No.

716
00:58:50,190 --> 00:58:51,760
I need to go.

717
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:57,730
Please open this door!

718
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:16,350
This is all my fault.

719
00:59:18,250 --> 00:59:19,290
I...

720
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:22,590
I was too late.

721
00:59:25,290 --> 00:59:28,230
I told them I would be early.

722
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:31,200
What will happen to Mom?

723
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:36,940
Please open this door.

724
00:59:38,410 --> 00:59:40,540
Please open this!

725
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:43,650
I need to go!

726
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,380
Please open this door!

727
01:00:57,450 --> 01:00:59,490
Ji Su.

728
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:02,020
Ji Su?

729
01:01:05,430 --> 01:01:06,790
I don't remember.

730
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:10,700
I remember everything...

731
01:01:11,730 --> 01:01:14,240
that happened that day,

732
01:01:17,310 --> 01:01:18,410
but I can't recall...

733
01:01:19,610 --> 01:01:21,410
the last moment I saw Mom and Ji Young,

734
01:01:23,510 --> 01:01:26,080
no matter how hard I try.

735
01:01:32,190 --> 01:01:33,290
Ji Su...

736
01:02:26,470 --> 01:02:28,340
(When My Love Blooms)

737
01:02:28,940 --> 01:02:32,980
I don't think I've been able to take a single step away from that day.

738
01:02:32,980 --> 01:02:35,080
Mom, please look over here!

739
01:02:35,220 --> 01:02:37,750
A deep wound also leaves a deep longing.

740
01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:41,260
How can you make that decision so easily?

741
01:02:41,260 --> 01:02:43,120
Nothing was ever easy.

742
01:02:43,490 --> 01:02:44,830
I had to put in my everything.

743
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:46,930
How could you know that just now?

744
01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:49,100
This is all your mom's fault!

745
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:50,260
I'm sorry, Young Min.

746
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:53,000
I think we need some time to heal.

747
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:56,140
Yes, I think you may be right.
