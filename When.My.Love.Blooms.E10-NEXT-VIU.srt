1
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,480
- What's wrong? - What's going on?

2
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,510
- Call the conductor. - What's that sound?

3
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:16,350
- Why is the light off? - What's going on?

4
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,120
- Goodness. - I can't be late.

5
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,220
Ladies and gentlemen,

6
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:22,350
we will be stopping momentarily due to a problem with the generator.

7
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:25,360
The train will start again as soon as we finish maintenance.

8
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,060
We apologize for the inconvenience.

9
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,230
It's okay.

10
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:50,820
It's raining. I need to go find my daughter.

11
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,250
My daughter will be cold out in the rain.

12
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,190
Ji Young!

13
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,160
Honey!

14
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,300
We're going to the department store to fix the clock today.

15
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,000
Should we get the strawberry cake there?

16
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,600
Dad told me to come to his office right away.

17
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,610
I should still hurry up and go. I'm sorry.

18
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:18,110
(Halt)

19
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,790
Ji Su.

20
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,360
Excuse me.

21
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,230
We might be late.

22
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,940
What do I do...

23
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,150
No.

24
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,420
I need to go.

25
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:37,560
Please open this door!

26
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,510
I...

27
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:03,880
I was too late.

28
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,450
I told them I would be early.

29
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:12,520
What will happen to Mom?

30
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:18,400
Please open this door.

31
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,910
Ji Su.

32
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:29,440
Ji Su?

33
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,350
I don't remember.

34
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,180
I remember everything...

35
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,690
that happened that day,

36
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:45,890
but I can't recall...

37
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,960
the last moment I saw Mom and Ji Young,

38
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,530
no matter how hard I try.

39
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,710
Ji Su...

40
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,750
Ji Su!

41
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:15,790
Ji Su.

42
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,050
(Episode 10)

43
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,820
I hoped it was the emergency room.

44
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,130
I prayed it was the emergency room.

45
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,330
That they were somehow alive.

46
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,070
I prayed and prayed.

47
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
We're going to the department store to fix the clock today.

48
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,270
Should we get the strawberry cake there?

49
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,290
I'm sorry.

50
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,190
I'm so sorry.

51
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,880
We're going to the department store to fix the clock today.

52
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,180
Should we get the strawberry cake there?

53
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,310
Whatever you want.

54
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:31,380
Get back early. Your dad will get mad again.

55
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,420
Yes, ma'am.

56
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:35,420
That brat. Look at her leaving without a proper goodbye.

57
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,360
I barely remember your face now!

58
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,480
Mom.

59
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,620
Ji Young.

60
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:09,790
Ji Young!

61
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,760
Mom!

62
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:16,490
Mom! Ji Young! Yoon Ji Young!

63
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:20,060
Mom! Look over here!

64
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:24,670
Mom, I'm... Will you look over just once?

65
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:26,870
Ji Young!

66
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:29,710
Look at me just once.

67
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,010
Just once.

68
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:36,080
Show me your face just one time.

69
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:39,020
Please, let me see you.

70
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,060
It's always the same dream.

71
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,260
However hard I scream,

72
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:56,300
Mom and Ji Young never look at me.

73
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,280
I should've looked at them more often.

74
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,820
She said she could barely remember my face.

75
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,290
I should've looked at them every day...

76
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:22,460
and told them that I loved them.

77
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,370
I have changed so much.

78
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,040
What if they don't recognize me?

79
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,840
I miss them so, so much.

80
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,910
What if I never see them again?

81
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,080
That's what I always think.

82
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,490
How could they not recognize you?

83
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,000
They'll be watching you every day.

84
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,240
I bet they noticed your white hair too.

85
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:13,240
"Ji Su has white hair now." That's what she'll say.

86
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:22,050
Your mother and sister...

87
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:26,060
will laugh and worry together,

88
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:30,630
and then discuss what you should do.

89
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,800
I bet they'll scold me for...

90
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:41,210
worrying about the afterlife when I have enough to worry about.

91
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:42,970
Very much.

92
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,250
It's possible that...

93
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,950
I haven't yet taken...

94
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,720
a single step away from what happened that day.

95
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,890
Do you have to?

96
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:09,070
That day might not be something you must...

97
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:10,600
overcome or leave behind,

98
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,210
or get away from.

99
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:21,110
A deep wound also means a deep longing.

100
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,450
You hurt because you miss them,

101
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,820
and miss them more because you hurt.

102
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,590
It's not about how...

103
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:33,890
you get through it but how you accept it.

104
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,360
If you keep facing yourself and looking inward,

105
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,970
then one day, your mother and sister's face...

106
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,240
will come back to you.

107
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:52,580
Was it like that for you?

108
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:06,220
In Dong Jin's words, you bet.

109
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,200
I put on a brave face, but I'm a long way off.

110
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,230
I'm about halfway there, I guess?

111
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:33,850
My daughter. Help me find my daughter.

112
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:35,250
- Please. - Get off me.

113
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:38,060
Please help me find my daughter.

114
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:44,060
Ji Young.

115
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:46,230
Ji Young.

116
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,670
Help me find her.

117
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:51,800
Please, doctor. My daughter.

118
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,570
My daughter and wife should be here.

119
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:57,810
- What? - Find her for me.

120
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:59,940
- Please. - Did they call to say they're here?

121
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,450
They should be here.

122
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:05,080
They were hurt. They'll be in bed with injuries.

123
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,180
Sorry.

124
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,590
Please, help me find my daughter.

125
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:37,110
The receiver cannot be reached. You will be directed to voicemail.

126
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,430
Hey!

127
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,660
- What will you do? - Let go.

128
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:52,230
I just heard them talk. I said I'm not sure!

129
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:54,330
I don't care. I'll kill them all.

130
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:55,630
- Han Jun Seo! - Jun Seo!

131
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:58,570
I said I didn't like you from the start!

132
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:04,040
I want you to die! Just die already!

133
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,780
What now? What's this about? What did I do wrong?

134
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,280
I just hate everything!

135
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,250
I hate you and your darn mom!

136
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,520
Why are you cursing my mom? Why?

137
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,650
Because all this is your mom's fault!

138
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,460
I was waiting for you.

139
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,330
You both came at the same time.

140
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,050
Jun Seo.

141
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:02,170
Young Min.

142
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:09,680
Young Min hit Jun Seo again.

143
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:14,610
Didn't I tell you last time that we should've taken full measures?

144
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:16,710
A thief becomes a robber.

145
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:18,950
Old proverbs are never wrong.

146
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:21,420
Do your bruises hurt?

147
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,330
Do they?

148
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:26,750
What happened?

149
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,910
Young Min.

150
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,000
Look at Mom.

151
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,950
Will you really not tell?

152
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:49,370
Shall we let it go again?

153
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:54,480
Then I can't help you this time.

154
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:57,210
I said last time that...

155
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:59,190
this would never happen again.

156
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:07,490
Are you...

157
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:12,170
angry with me?

158
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:21,710
Neither of them will say what it was about.

159
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:25,850
Rather than that, the important fact is that...

160
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:27,390
Young Min hit Jun Seo first.

161
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:30,390
Isn't the reason more important than who started the fight?

162
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:32,960
Ms. Kim.

163
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,400
Were there any students with them or who saw the fight?

164
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:38,720
Speak up.

165
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,400
I was told you were there.

166
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,440
If you don't talk,

167
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:45,840
you'll be called to the School Violence Committee,

168
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,730
and it'll go on your record.

169
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:50,640
Who hit whom first?

170
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,610
Jun...

171
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:56,180
I mean, Young Min lashed out first.

172
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,250
There must be a reason.

173
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:10,200
Because Young Min's mom and Jun Seo's dad...

174
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,600
are up to no good.

175
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:54,770
Young Min.

176
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,410
Mom heard everything.

177
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,310
I know why you refused to see me.

178
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:08,620
It really...

179
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:12,280
breaks my heart.

180
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:15,720
Mine too.

181
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,440
Is it true what Jun Seo said?

182
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,610
Young Min.

183
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,070
I don't know what you'll think of it.

184
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,620
It might make you angrier,

185
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:43,620
or it might make you feel better, I don't know.

186
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:52,130
But I'll tell you what happened long ago.

187
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,370
Jun Seo's dad...

188
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:05,910
was Mom's first love.

189
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:47,850
The two people...

190
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,190
that got along the worst were left with each other.

191
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:56,600
Dad!

192
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,430
Where are you going?

193
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,230
They're gone.

194
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:04,870
They're really gone.

195
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,640
She hasn't gone!

196
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:10,570
Why has Ji Young gone?

197
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:13,000
If you say that once more,

198
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:15,180
I will kill you myself!

199
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:56,780
Why are you here?

200
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:08,840
Will you not come back to university?

201
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,210
I think I'll quit.

202
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,680
I get why,

203
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,970
but there's no need to quit.

204
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:21,680
Take some time off, and when you're ready...

205
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,470
My dad was fired.

206
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:27,280
For abusing his authority and taking bribes.

207
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:31,820
And he admitted to everything when he was questioned.

208
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:35,630
It's as if...

209
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:40,170
my dad is slowly dying instead of living.

210
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:48,070
The department store is a five-minute walk from my house.

211
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:53,450
I think every day that my dad could die.

212
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:02,660
That's why I want to leave this place.

213
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,520
What about Jae Hyun?

214
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:40,130
Thanks to those moments that were as pretty as flowers,

215
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,630
I think...

216
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:45,630
I can go on.

217
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:49,460
Sorry and thank you.

218
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:51,500
Jae Hyun.

219
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:09,250
(To Jae Hyun)

220
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:50,860
There you are.

221
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,340
Yoon Ji Su.

222
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:49,620
(To Jae Hyun)

223
00:25:58,370 --> 00:25:59,930
(Thanks to those moments that were as pretty as flowers,)

224
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:01,520
(I think I can go on. Sorry and thank you. Jae Hyun.)

225
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:18,150
She isn't anywhere.

226
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:22,620
She moved away.

227
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,660
She quit university too.

228
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:30,930
Young Woo.

229
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:33,520
Did she tell you anything?

230
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,990
No.

231
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:38,610
What about her friend?

232
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:41,000
Ji Su's closest friend who studies engineering.

233
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:42,680
Hye Jung?

234
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:45,680
Do you think she's in the dark too?

235
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:54,150
If I were her, even I wouldn't want to see anyone.

236
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:58,890
I do feel really bad for her,

237
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,720
but she should fight.

238
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,220
Why did she disappear on her own?

239
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:05,100
The brat.

240
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,700
I will keep looking...

241
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,600
until I must return to my base.

242
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:13,710
Once I go back,

243
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:16,230
can you guys keep looking?

244
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,710
It'll be so hard on her and she's on her own.

245
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:26,710
If something bad were to happen...

246
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,250
I can't survive that.

247
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:39,200
I was physically healthy and mentally stable,

248
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:42,560
but there was nothing I could do for her.

249
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,230
The woman I loved with all my heart was crumbling.

250
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:52,240
But the only thing I could do was watching her crumble from afar.

251
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:55,180
So throughout my life,

252
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:59,090
it had broken my heart and tortured me.

253
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:02,920
Do you understand where I'm coming from?

254
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:09,930
But I always wished that she would lead a good life.

255
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:14,290
And by chance, we met again.

256
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:18,290
She was struggling just like before.

257
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:21,440
So it felt like I was transported back to the past.

258
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,230
It had pained me.

259
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:29,850
But you have Mom, Dad.

260
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,920
I had...

261
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:44,050
no choice but to leave.

262
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:51,600
After that day,

263
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,110
I felt as if...

264
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:58,500
I didn't deserve...

265
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:03,950
to be happy...

266
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:08,690
from loving someone or being loved by someone.

267
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:18,600
You're so little,

268
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:23,670
but I gave you such a big burden to carry.

269
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:31,440
I'm sorry, Young Min.

270
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:58,170
- Yes? - Hello.

271
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:00,260
I'm calling from the sanatorium.

272
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:02,470
Is this Mr. Han Jae Hyun?

273
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:03,800
Yes, it is. What is this about?

274
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:08,270
Mr. Yoon Hyung Gu's daughter isn't answering her phone.

275
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:11,920
The patient had left the sanatorium and hasn't come back.

276
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:17,620
His mother isn't like the other mothers.

277
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,130
Other moms are willing to cover up anything for their children...

278
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:21,590
and trying to make a good impression.

279
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:23,520
But she isn't interested in doing so to the point...

280
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,930
that it bothers me.

281
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:28,260
I'd expect that from her.

282
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:30,960
But for now, I did make this...

283
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:33,460
into Young Min's fault, not Jun Seo's.

284
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,440
But I'm a bit worried about...

285
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,770
how Young Min and his mother will handle this.

286
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:40,710
Their claim won't do anything. They don't have any proof.

287
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:42,680
That's true.

288
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,420
By the way, if a student violates the school policy...

289
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:48,190
and causes serious trouble,

290
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:51,310
can't you expel the student with your authority as the principal?

291
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:53,780
Yes, I can do that.

292
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,700
Even if the School Violence Committee is held,

293
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:58,700
expelling him would be the highest degree of punishment.

294
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:01,400
And they don't make such decisions to middle school students.

295
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:04,260
I'm concerned that people might question it.

296
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:07,440
So what? I'm sure the gossip won't last long.

297
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:10,940
Do you think people are interested in other people's lives?

298
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:13,500
You're right. They are not.

299
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:17,510
Then, I'll call you again as we proceed further.

300
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:18,810
Sure.

301
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:24,390
(Three-way Supermarket)

302
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,020
You didn't answer your phone.

303
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,790
It's been off.

304
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,020
The sanatorium called me.

305
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:36,400
Your father left but didn't come back.

306
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:42,470
Do you know a place he might go?

307
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:46,040
It's raining. He probably went there.

308
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:00,460
What are you doing here again? You're breaking my heart.

309
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,960
What if something really happens to you?

310
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,400
(Emergency Center)

311
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:09,140
Ji Su.

312
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,140
Isn't it a relief...

313
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:16,970
that we found your mom and Ji Young?

314
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:24,120
I heard a lot of families couldn't even find the bodies.

315
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:28,310
We should be grateful.

316
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:32,720
But still,

317
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,360
I...

318
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:40,060
miss them a lot.

319
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:48,140
Dad.

320
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,840
Do you have a minute?

321
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:09,280
You said you were curious...

322
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:12,880
about why I left.

323
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:22,170
It wasn't your fault.

324
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,400
And I knew it too well.

325
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:29,740
But I was scared that I might resent you for it.

326
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:32,880
If I weren't leaving to see you,

327
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:36,510
I would have turned back to see them that day.

328
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:40,840
And Mom and Ji Young wouldn't even have been at the department store.

329
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:44,650
We would have been together and spent a peaceful evening.

330
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:49,190
Resenting myself wouldn't probably have been enough.

331
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:52,900
I would have found someone else to blame.

332
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,190
And that would have been you.

333
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,970
I thought that after resenting you,

334
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:03,630
I might even end up hating you.

335
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,170
I thought we might hurt each other...

336
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:08,970
and that would be more painful.

337
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:14,220
But this time, Young Min got hurt.

338
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:18,150
Of course, it's not your fault again.

339
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:21,050
But I'm confused.

340
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:23,260
It makes me wonder...

341
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:25,720
if my talk with him wasn't enough after the last incident.

342
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:28,840
I understand that a mother can have a big influence,

343
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:33,030
but a son would be scared of his dad.

344
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,530
When it crosses my mind,

345
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:38,110
I stop myself.

346
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:41,150
I think to myself that...

347
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,380
I'm blaming you again like a fool...

348
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,440
and I'm making the same mistake...

349
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:48,720
now and 25 years ago.

350
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,820
Jae Hyun,

351
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,490
the kids are emotionally and physically hurt.

352
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:04,440
They need time to heal.

353
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:07,740
Perhaps, we do too.

354
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,940
Okay.

355
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,150
You might be right.

356
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:04,490
(Homeroom Teacher)

357
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:11,740
Yes.

358
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:16,210
Yes. Okay. I see.

359
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:24,940
The School Violence Committee will be held.

360
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,990
Mom.

361
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:31,110
Are you still sorry?

362
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:35,050
Yes.

363
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:38,050
Then,

364
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,670
can you let me do what I want?

365
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:46,740
Yes.

366
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:48,800
Sir,

367
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:51,800
you cannot change your mind and must proceed...

368
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:54,070
even if he comes to you and tries to talk you out of it.

369
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:56,220
Okay.

370
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:04,190
- Will the committee be held? - Do you think it shouldn't be?

371
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,760
He attacked my son twice.

372
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:10,130
I won't let it slide this time.

373
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:12,220
What will you do?

374
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:15,090
I will publicly humiliate him and get him expelled from school.

375
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:19,710
But I hit him too.

376
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:26,800
Is what you told me yesterday the whole story?

377
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:28,240
About what?

378
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:31,280
Did he really just hit you? Without any reason?

379
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,150
There was a reason.

380
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:39,460
He said I looked down on him and bullied him.

381
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,400
Forget it then. Have your meal.

382
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:53,400
You can tell your side when the committee is held.

383
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,940
Why did you come now?

384
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:57,610
Young Min has something to tell you.

385
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:00,780
Young Min.

386
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:04,670
I will listen to both sides with impartiality.

387
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:07,110
If I listen to one side of the story and make a decision,

388
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:08,880
it will be partial.

389
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:12,280
I know that you will only believe Jun Seo.

390
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,420
What do you mean?

391
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,420
When did I only believe Jun Seo?

392
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:21,800
I did not hit him first.

393
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:25,090
But I was mad and hit him back. And that was wrong.

394
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,110
I will face my punishment.

395
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:30,240
That's why the School Violence Committee will be held.

396
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:32,740
I don't want to face the punishment from the school.

397
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:37,110
The school didn't do anything for me...

398
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:40,240
when I was bullied at school.

399
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:43,280
So...

400
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:46,190
I'm going to leave this school.

401
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:26,970
Okay. Just cry.

402
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:29,360
You can cry.

403
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:33,970
I know how that must feel.

404
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,530
It's all right.

405
00:40:58,340 --> 00:40:59,770
Does it mean I'm an elementary school graduate?

406
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:03,810
I'm a high school graduate.

407
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:07,150
I know that you love me, but you shouldn't follow the same path.

408
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:10,180
Young Min.

409
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:13,920
You can transfer to another school. Why did you quit school?

410
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:16,520
I thought that would end this quickly.

411
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,290
That way, it will hurt you less.

412
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:24,860
Don't you hate me?

413
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:30,540
I was angry that there was a rumor about you and Han Jun Seo's dad...

414
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:32,540
of all people.

415
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,580
I'm sorry.

416
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:43,580
You might think I don't mean it because I say it too often.

417
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:48,190
But I'm really sorry.

418
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:53,690
By the way, what will happen with you and his dad?

419
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,000
Will you not see him...

420
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,430
if I don't want you to?

421
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:12,040
Yes.

422
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,980
That kid quit school. Did you tell him to do that?

423
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,120
He did?

424
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,990
It was his mother's doing then.

425
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:23,390
She wanted him to leave school before he got kicked out.

426
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:26,590
Isn't this petty?

427
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:28,190
What's your point?

428
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:34,530
I'm telling you the divorce you want won't be easy.

429
00:42:35,170 --> 00:42:37,500
Do you think you can raise another man's son...

430
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:39,870
after abandoning your beloved son?

431
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:52,220
Dad, do you remember Young Min?

432
00:42:53,290 --> 00:42:54,350
Hello.

433
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:07,630
It's okay.

434
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:16,510
It's Saturday.

435
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:19,810
It would have been better if Jae Hyun was eating with us.

436
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:23,850
He goes to work on Saturday too. You know that he's a workaholic.

437
00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:30,020
I didn't mean it in a bad way.

438
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:35,090
I didn't tell him that you were coming over on purpose.

439
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:40,270
I just wanted to talk to you in private.

440
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,670
Did something happen?

441
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:50,480
Jae Hyun does everything you tell him to do.

442
00:43:50,910 --> 00:43:52,950
He loves you dearly.

443
00:43:54,110 --> 00:43:55,880
If you tell him that you like me,

444
00:43:56,350 --> 00:43:58,420
I thought he might not leave me.

445
00:43:58,950 --> 00:44:00,020
Something is...

446
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:02,690
going on between you two.

447
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:06,960
Can you stop Jae Hyun, Mother?

448
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:13,730
When did you get here?

449
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:16,170
Why are you here alone?

450
00:44:19,610 --> 00:44:20,840
Did something happen?

451
00:44:23,110 --> 00:44:25,710
I should ask you that. What's the matter with you?

452
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:30,280
Seo Kyung asked me to stop you.

453
00:44:32,650 --> 00:44:34,250
You said you met her.

454
00:44:35,350 --> 00:44:37,460
Did something happen between you and her?

455
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:43,030
I know the life you had led after she left.

456
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:46,230
If I were to only think about you,

457
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:49,000
I would tell you to divorce her.

458
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:52,270
But when I thought about your son,

459
00:44:53,770 --> 00:44:55,810
I can't bring myself to say that.

460
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:05,650
What a surprise. You came out to greet me.

461
00:45:05,850 --> 00:45:07,120
Did you drink?

462
00:45:08,450 --> 00:45:09,960
After you asked my mother to come?

463
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:12,160
I told her everything I wanted to tell her.

464
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:23,370
Seeing your reaction,

465
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:27,370
I guess you won't listen to your mother either.

466
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:28,670
It's between you and me.

467
00:45:29,410 --> 00:45:30,880
There's nothing my mother can do.

468
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:32,810
That can't be.

469
00:45:33,350 --> 00:45:36,220
I'll do everything. I'll use everyone.

470
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:41,450
It's a pity that your father passed away pretty early.

471
00:45:42,290 --> 00:45:43,890
He would probably be on my side.

472
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:46,760
I just need you to make your decision.

473
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:48,860
I can't.

474
00:45:49,730 --> 00:45:52,400
How could I make a decision like this so easily?

475
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:54,430
Nothing in life was easy.

476
00:45:55,430 --> 00:45:58,100
I had to risk everything I had on every decision I made.

477
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:10,420
(Bada Piano)

478
00:46:14,950 --> 00:46:17,090
- Bye, Yu Bin. - Bye.

479
00:46:22,290 --> 00:46:24,760
- Is that your friend, Yu Bin? - She's not my friend.

480
00:46:26,370 --> 00:46:27,570
Are you here for a lesson?

481
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:29,900
She doesn't have any lessons.

482
00:46:30,870 --> 00:46:33,270
I can play it better even if I don't get any lessons.

483
00:46:34,510 --> 00:46:36,710
That's ridiculous. How can you play it...

484
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:37,710
when you don't get any lessons?

485
00:46:37,710 --> 00:46:39,340
I can play.

486
00:46:39,810 --> 00:46:41,710
You don't even have a piano at home.

487
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:43,850
I can still play.

488
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,220
Then would you like to try?

489
00:46:58,600 --> 00:46:59,830
Ms. Yoon.

490
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,000
Mom said I need to be home for dinner.

491
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:05,940
All right, Yu Bin. Go on home.

492
00:47:06,510 --> 00:47:08,340
Good-bye, ma'am.

493
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:16,850
Byeol, how did you play that?

494
00:47:16,850 --> 00:47:18,280
Are you sure you never had lessons?

495
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:20,820
Then can you play anything else?

496
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:40,470
Are you sure you never had lessons, Byeol?

497
00:47:40,770 --> 00:47:43,080
- Yes. - And you can't read notes?

498
00:47:44,210 --> 00:47:47,310
But you can tell how to play as soon as you hear it?

499
00:47:47,410 --> 00:47:48,450
Yes.

500
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:52,990
Would you like to take classes, Byeol?

501
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:57,020
Mom says we don't have the money, no matter what.

502
00:47:57,860 --> 00:48:00,560
I can teach you for free if you come around this time.

503
00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:01,790
But I don't have any money.

504
00:48:01,790 --> 00:48:03,360
I won't be taking any.

505
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:05,200
I just want to hear you play.

506
00:48:08,230 --> 00:48:09,330
Go on.

507
00:48:17,210 --> 00:48:18,640
Ms. Yoon.

508
00:48:19,610 --> 00:48:21,180
Thank you.

509
00:48:32,290 --> 00:48:33,690
(For Rent)

510
00:49:00,090 --> 00:49:01,620
(For Rent)

511
00:49:07,290 --> 00:49:08,560
I know you're a busy man,

512
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:10,300
so I'll just verify a few things and get it over with.

513
00:49:11,630 --> 00:49:13,130
The plaintiff's main argument is that...

514
00:49:13,130 --> 00:49:14,700
the suicide of Kwon Hyuk Soo...

515
00:49:14,870 --> 00:49:17,140
was due to the malicious destruction of the labor union,

516
00:49:17,370 --> 00:49:20,340
and that you were in the middle...

517
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:22,010
of that case.

518
00:49:22,010 --> 00:49:23,210
Do you admit to it?

519
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:24,480
That is not true.

520
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:26,780
Yes, I can tell too.

521
00:49:27,050 --> 00:49:29,250
The reference material the plaintiff submitted...

522
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:31,050
were all circumstances and speculations...

523
00:49:31,050 --> 00:49:32,680
and had no proof, except that...

524
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:34,520
you were the director of the Strategy and Planning Department.

525
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:36,860
There was illegal destruction of the union.

526
00:49:39,290 --> 00:49:40,360
Sorry?

527
00:49:40,590 --> 00:49:43,560
What I meant earlier was that I wasn't involved in it.

528
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:45,830
I didn't mean that...

529
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:49,230
an unfair labor practice on Hyung Sung's side didn't exist.

530
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:51,600
Five years ago, a meticulous and malicious...

531
00:49:52,270 --> 00:49:54,610
destruction of the labor union was enacted...

532
00:49:54,610 --> 00:49:55,710
and that...

533
00:49:56,610 --> 00:49:59,850
directly contributed to the death of Kwon Hyuk Soo.

534
00:50:01,010 --> 00:50:03,620
Sir, do you understand...

535
00:50:03,850 --> 00:50:06,450
what you are saying and what results...

536
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:08,150
it may bring?

537
00:50:08,490 --> 00:50:09,890
I do,

538
00:50:10,690 --> 00:50:12,220
and I am fully prepared.

539
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:29,270
Are you looking for that old man?

540
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:31,140
I don't see him today.

541
00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:36,950
This is the Certificate of Disposition...

542
00:50:37,150 --> 00:50:39,480
from the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office.

543
00:50:40,590 --> 00:50:42,420
"No charges".

544
00:50:42,690 --> 00:50:44,360
"Disposition of non-indictment".

545
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:48,290
What does this mean?

546
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:51,630
It means he can not be punished, due to a lack of evidence...

547
00:50:51,730 --> 00:50:53,800
to prove that Han Jae Hyun is guilty...

548
00:50:54,970 --> 00:50:56,670
or because he did not constitute a crime.

549
00:50:56,670 --> 00:50:57,970
Then...

550
00:50:58,770 --> 00:51:00,610
what happens now?

551
00:51:00,810 --> 00:51:02,210
Legally,

552
00:51:03,010 --> 00:51:05,140
there's nothing we can do now.

553
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:10,550
He is a nasty and meticulous man.

554
00:51:11,350 --> 00:51:12,920
Goodness, Hyuk Soo.

555
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:16,390
My poor boy. What can we do?

556
00:51:18,390 --> 00:51:20,490
I can't live like this.

557
00:51:21,730 --> 00:51:26,430
I just can't live like this, Mr. Lee.

558
00:51:34,210 --> 00:51:36,740
I don't think I can live like this either.

559
00:52:12,510 --> 00:52:14,380
I understand that...

560
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:17,220
you own a lot.

561
00:52:17,950 --> 00:52:20,020
The whole country knows that.

562
00:52:22,290 --> 00:52:25,590
I also know how you obtained it,

563
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:28,560
so I won't ever be taking anything you offer.

564
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:32,400
I heard you think dearly of your son,

565
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:33,930
but I guess that was wrong.

566
00:52:33,930 --> 00:52:35,830
It's because I think dearly of him.

567
00:52:37,670 --> 00:52:39,670
And please stop tailing me.

568
00:52:40,410 --> 00:52:41,410
I will report you...

569
00:52:41,410 --> 00:52:43,340
for illegal tailing and surveillance.

570
00:52:48,650 --> 00:52:50,950
I haven't shown even the slightest amount...

571
00:52:51,350 --> 00:52:53,820
of what I own and what my powers are...

572
00:52:54,350 --> 00:52:55,650
because I pitied...

573
00:52:56,620 --> 00:52:58,360
your sick dad...

574
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:01,430
and what happened to your mom and sister.

575
00:53:01,490 --> 00:53:05,000
I'm sorry but I have no interest at all.

576
00:53:05,530 --> 00:53:07,370
I don't want anything from you...

577
00:53:07,730 --> 00:53:09,470
carrot nor stick.

578
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:11,340
It's all illegality and blackmail to me.

579
00:53:36,090 --> 00:53:38,630
(Murderous Company, I report the brutality of Hyung Sung!)

580
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:56,350
I'll show you...

581
00:53:56,350 --> 00:53:58,180
what Han Jae Hyun did.

582
00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:03,960
It's been 25 years since we promised this.

583
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:08,560
I guess so.

584
00:54:20,570 --> 00:54:22,640
I don't think it tastes the same.

585
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:27,050
It was really good back then.

586
00:54:27,650 --> 00:54:29,980
It must be because you were really hungry back then.

587
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:31,180
No.

588
00:54:33,850 --> 00:54:35,520
It's because of the change.

589
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:41,130
Because you've changed.

590
00:54:43,930 --> 00:54:46,970
It's a relief the arrest warrant was dismissed,

591
00:54:47,430 --> 00:54:48,800
but I'm not sure.

592
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,670
I don't know what the truth is...

593
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:54,510
or what is right.

594
00:54:57,710 --> 00:55:01,010
And I know the old man who protests alone...

595
00:55:02,010 --> 00:55:03,650
in front of the company.

596
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:06,050
I helped him out when he was having a hard time.

597
00:55:09,050 --> 00:55:10,360
Did that...

598
00:55:13,090 --> 00:55:15,690
really happen to his son because of you?

599
00:55:17,730 --> 00:55:19,360
It's a long story,

600
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:22,000
but the conclusion is "no".

601
00:55:23,970 --> 00:55:26,770
You may not believe me because of all I've done,

602
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:31,640
but I don't intend on lying to you.

603
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:35,110
This is like a thorn in my side,

604
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:36,750
but if you can wait a while,

605
00:55:38,050 --> 00:55:39,420
I will tell you the long story.

606
00:55:40,650 --> 00:55:42,220
Although I won't be able to at the moment.

607
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:52,460
(Jae Hyun)

608
00:55:57,840 --> 00:55:58,940
Jae Hyun.

609
00:56:00,570 --> 00:56:02,210
I think I'll have to hear it.

610
00:56:03,810 --> 00:56:05,410
The long story.

611
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:09,450
Yoon Hyung Gu's daughter came to see me this afternoon.

612
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:11,320
She's a tough one.

613
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:14,450
Unlike her father,

614
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:18,360
she has a kind of temper or spite.

615
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:24,060
She got me full of thoughts, wondering what I should do...

616
00:56:24,230 --> 00:56:25,960
with this ignorant fool.

617
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:30,640
- Sir... - I told you to sit down, already.

618
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:32,870
I came to see you...

619
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:36,110
because of something I found while looking into Yoon Hyung Gu.

620
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:38,110
What is it?

621
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:41,180
It goes all the way back to my father.

622
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:44,420
I got a call when I was in the army.

623
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:49,090
That my father had taken his own life.

624
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:54,660
After being tormented by false accusations that...

625
00:56:55,460 --> 00:56:56,630
he had betrayed his colleagues,

626
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:00,600
taking the lead in the destruction of the labor union,

627
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:06,200
and acting as the informant on the company's side.

628
00:57:07,770 --> 00:57:09,970
Unlike the bastards in the union...

629
00:57:09,970 --> 00:57:11,980
who call for a strike whenever possible,

630
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:14,580
there was a man who tried to hear the company's side as well.

631
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:17,020
He was that man, and he was a perfect fit...

632
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:18,480
for our plan.

633
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:21,020
He was good with people, so things worked out well,

634
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:22,520
and the existing labor union dissolved.

635
00:57:23,390 --> 00:57:26,490
We agreed on a restructuring with the new labor union, but...

636
00:57:26,490 --> 00:57:28,690
So what are you trying to say?

637
00:57:28,890 --> 00:57:31,900
He sued the company...

638
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:33,300
for unfair labor practice.

639
00:57:33,430 --> 00:57:34,800
And we stopped that, didn't we?

640
00:57:35,130 --> 00:57:36,740
Yes, the prosecution worked things out...

641
00:57:36,740 --> 00:57:38,370
and laid the dissolution of the labor union...

642
00:57:38,370 --> 00:57:40,040
and the layoffs to his charge.

643
00:57:40,670 --> 00:57:42,910
Because of that, the executives of the dissolved union labor...

644
00:57:42,910 --> 00:57:44,540
and the employees who had been laid off...

645
00:57:44,910 --> 00:57:47,110
all ended up suing him.

646
00:57:47,550 --> 00:57:50,950
So all the charges on the company were dismissed,

647
00:57:51,350 --> 00:57:54,290
and he was the one charged for illegal destruction...

648
00:57:54,290 --> 00:57:55,520
of the labor union.

649
00:57:58,090 --> 00:58:01,230
He committed suicide sometime after,

650
00:58:03,190 --> 00:58:08,000
and we just confirmed that...

651
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,370
he was Han Jae Hyun's father.

652
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:16,610
It was the most lonely funeral.

653
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:51,510
(When My Love Blooms)

654
00:58:52,940 --> 00:58:56,450
If someone was to take the blame for what happened to my father,

655
00:58:57,980 --> 00:58:59,250
it has to be me.

656
00:59:00,450 --> 00:59:03,490
Yoon Ji Su's son used violence against Jun Seo.

657
00:59:03,490 --> 00:59:05,360
What are you trying to say?

658
00:59:05,890 --> 00:59:08,090
I don't know how to fight nicely.

659
00:59:08,790 --> 00:59:11,300
I will win and rip you apart to pieces.

660
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:12,400
Let's end this.

661
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:15,130
I don't want to repeat the most painful mistake...

662
00:59:15,130 --> 00:59:16,670
in my life.

663
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:19,140
Since I need to be happy.
