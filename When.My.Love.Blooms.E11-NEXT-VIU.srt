1
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:09,580
It goes all the way back to my father.

2
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,520
I got a call when I was in the army.

3
00:00:13,689 --> 00:00:17,159
That my father had taken his own life.

4
00:00:20,959 --> 00:00:22,760
After being tormented by false accusations that...

5
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:24,799
he had betrayed his colleagues,

6
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,629
taking the lead in the destruction of the labor union,

7
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:34,269
and acting as the informant on the company's side.

8
00:00:35,739 --> 00:00:38,739
He sued the company...

9
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:40,280
for unfair labor practice.

10
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,710
And we stopped that, didn't we?

11
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:43,479
Yes, the prosecution worked things out...

12
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:45,080
and laid the dissolution of the labor union...

13
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,089
and the layoffs to his charge.

14
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:49,790
Because of that, the executives of the dissolved union labor...

15
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:51,689
and the employees who had been laid off...

16
00:00:51,689 --> 00:00:53,989
all ended up suing him.

17
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,859
So all the charges on the company were dismissed,

18
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,130
and he was the one charged for illegal destruction...

19
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:02,430
of the labor union.

20
00:01:04,969 --> 00:01:08,169
He committed suicide sometime after,

21
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,710
and we just confirmed that...

22
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,219
he was Han Jae Hyun's father.

23
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,419
It was the most lonely funeral.

24
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,499
No one came.

25
00:01:33,499 --> 00:01:34,669
(1996)

26
00:01:35,669 --> 00:01:36,869
It was as if...

27
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,669
my father had been abandoned.

28
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,740
Why he took his own life,

29
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,109
both Mom and I...

30
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,150
had no idea at all.

31
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,219
Until we found...

32
00:01:51,219 --> 00:01:54,749
all the complaints issued against him in his bag.

33
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:58,119
Those who didn't attend the funeral...

34
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:00,990
were named in the complaints.

35
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:04,429
They blamed him for the broken union.

36
00:02:04,729 --> 00:02:06,899
They blamed him for their lost jobs.

37
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:09,699
They were sure he embezzled from the company...

38
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:12,600
and demanded there should be a thorough investigation.

39
00:02:15,109 --> 00:02:17,310
The path my father had taken his whole life,

40
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:21,979
the path that I was following,

41
00:02:23,049 --> 00:02:24,380
disgusted me.

42
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:29,989
How I should live and what I should live for.

43
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,030
That's when I made up my mind.

44
00:02:35,229 --> 00:02:37,660
How could we only realize that now?

45
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:42,229
For fear that our company would be connected to his death,

46
00:02:42,429 --> 00:02:44,100
we made it look like he'd resigned...

47
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,639
and deleted all his files.

48
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:47,870
When we ran Mr. Han Jae Hyun's identity,

49
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:49,810
nothing showed up.

50
00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:51,410
I apologize, sir.

51
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,040
And Jae Hyun.

52
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,049
Since when did he know?

53
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,149
Did he know when he approached Seo Kyung?

54
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,190
I don't believe so.

55
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,560
According to IT,

56
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,620
Mr. Han first accessed...

57
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,989
the files on the labor union five years ago.

58
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:12,899
But five years ago,

59
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:15,699
a union member called Kwon Hyuk Soo killed himself.

60
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:19,070
The old man's son?

61
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,679
His death reminded me of my father.

62
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,810
What began with a belief...

63
00:03:27,649 --> 00:03:29,579
turned into foolish naivete,

64
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:32,320
and the colleagues' resentment and hatred...

65
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,790
sent him to his death.

66
00:03:37,359 --> 00:03:38,489
It was the same.

67
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,399
That's when I started to search for the truth...

68
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,970
and found out that Chairman Jang was behind...

69
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:51,139
both the deaths.

70
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:55,739
The days I'd spent as his loyal hound...

71
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,739
became too much to handle.

72
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,579
That is why...

73
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:05,850
I didn't turn down the four-year stint in prison.

74
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,230
It must've hurt so much.

75
00:04:21,599 --> 00:04:23,529
Being alone for so long.

76
00:04:26,039 --> 00:04:27,610
While I was behind bars,

77
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:30,010
I thought a lot about my father.

78
00:04:55,899 --> 00:04:57,500
The resentment and fury...

79
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,199
I felt after my father had died...

80
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:10,180
was actually my guilt and yearning for him.

81
00:05:14,149 --> 00:05:15,620
As time went by,

82
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,690
I felt more guilty...

83
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,529
and missed him even more.

84
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,800
Dad...

85
00:05:31,969 --> 00:05:33,370
Dad.

86
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:37,639
Dad.

87
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:39,240
Dad.

88
00:05:40,449 --> 00:05:41,949
Dad.

89
00:05:55,459 --> 00:05:56,730
It's nothing.

90
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,630
Why can't you drink it?

91
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:06,769
It's delicious.

92
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:14,849
Jae Hyun.

93
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,149
Your father...

94
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:23,449
will miss you a lot too.

95
00:06:27,089 --> 00:06:28,930
Just like him,

96
00:06:29,159 --> 00:06:32,029
you're warmhearted and sweet.

97
00:06:33,329 --> 00:06:34,730
You may have lost out,

98
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:37,599
but you always sided with the weak.

99
00:06:39,969 --> 00:06:43,610
I also think he'll be very curious about you.

100
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:46,310
About how you will live...

101
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,980
from now on.

102
00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:51,250
And what you will live for.

103
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:04,630
(Noodles in Anchovy Broth)

104
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:14,209
We are so very connected in a twisted way.

105
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:47,709
(Fall of 1995)

106
00:07:55,649 --> 00:07:57,050
Excuse me.

107
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,250
Did the family here move away?

108
00:08:00,889 --> 00:08:04,190
I haven't seen anyone leave in a while.

109
00:08:04,589 --> 00:08:07,360
I don't know if they moved.

110
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:41,289
FM Music City's last song of the day...

111
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:43,029
is from Light and Salt.

112
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:45,659
"Do Not Leave My Side".

113
00:11:50,779 --> 00:11:51,880
Jae Hyun.

114
00:11:53,549 --> 00:11:54,620
Hey.

115
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:55,819
You're out on break?

116
00:11:58,289 --> 00:12:01,059
Did Ji Su ever come by?

117
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:02,760
Would she come here?

118
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,630
You said she left on purpose.

119
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:07,330
But still. Just in case.

120
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,269
She's not at home or on campus.

121
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:45,139
Hi, this is Yoon Ji Su's boyfriend, Han Jae Hyun's pager.

122
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,600
If you're a guy, press 1 or 2.

123
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,169
And if you're a girl, just hang up. He's taken.

124
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:51,380
Besides, his girlfriend has a bad temper.

125
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,909
What are you doing? I'll scold you.

126
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:59,750
Hi, this is Yoon Ji Su's boyfriend, Han Jae Hyun's pager.

127
00:12:59,819 --> 00:13:01,350
If you're a guy, press 1 or 2.

128
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:03,850
And if you're a girl, just hang up. He's taken.

129
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:06,260
Besides, his girlfriend has a bad temper.

130
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,460
What are you doing?

131
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:12,700
Hi, this is Yoon Ji Su's boyfriend, Han Jae Hyun's pager.

132
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:14,370
If you're a guy, press 1 or 2.

133
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:16,899
And if you're a girl, just hang up. He's taken.

134
00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:19,370
Besides, his girlfriend has a bad temper.

135
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,330
Did you have to get discharged on such a hot day?

136
00:13:46,299 --> 00:13:49,069
Did you have to come here when I told you not to?

137
00:13:49,069 --> 00:13:50,500
I did out of pity.

138
00:13:50,669 --> 00:13:53,539
You have no dad or girlfriend.

139
00:13:54,669 --> 00:13:56,669
Did you look for Ji Su?

140
00:13:56,809 --> 00:14:00,439
Thanks to you, I became great friends with the music majors.

141
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:03,850
They grew up wanting for nothing,

142
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:05,080
and they're so naive.

143
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,179
You got their pager numbers...

144
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,389
instead of looking for Ji Su.

145
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:10,250
You're talking about pagers?

146
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,860
Hey. The day after tomorrow, I get my new phone.

147
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:16,059
- Landline? - Cellphone.

148
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,799
You hold it like this and go...

149
00:14:18,059 --> 00:14:19,730
"Ideal for Korea's geography".

150
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:22,069
- "Any"... - Stop talking nonsense and walk.

151
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:25,139
You should get one too now that you're a civilian.

152
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:26,340
I need to save money.

153
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,340
Don't you need to have money to save?

154
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:30,569
- I'll make some. - Doing what?

155
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,409
Anything.

156
00:14:33,939 --> 00:14:35,980
Will you not take the bar exam?

157
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:38,120
I have no time for that.

158
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,480
I'll graduate fast and make money.

159
00:14:41,649 --> 00:14:44,189
My mom's weaker and can't work much longer.

160
00:14:44,659 --> 00:14:46,519
My dad's friends and colleagues...

161
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,689
are all gone.

162
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:50,659
What'll you do with money?

163
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:55,569
I have to repay a debt.

164
00:14:56,069 --> 00:14:58,340
You're in debt? To whom?

165
00:14:59,939 --> 00:15:01,639
- My dad. - Your dad?

166
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:06,980
Did your dad lend you the money for your tuition?

167
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:11,620
That's totally the American way.

168
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:19,889
My dad gave me the money he made by working day labor.

169
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:23,090
You just kept it?

170
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,360
I couldn't spend it.

171
00:15:30,669 --> 00:15:32,799
So I want to return it.

172
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,769
With a million times in interest.

173
00:16:03,769 --> 00:16:06,069
Do you miss your dad a lot?

174
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,539
I don't know.

175
00:16:10,539 --> 00:16:12,409
Why don't you know?

176
00:16:14,649 --> 00:16:15,809
I don't remember him.

177
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,679
When I was out on break,

178
00:16:20,419 --> 00:16:22,289
I last saw him outside my house.

179
00:16:24,189 --> 00:16:25,789
It was late and dark.

180
00:16:28,929 --> 00:16:30,059
I don't remember him.

181
00:16:31,059 --> 00:16:32,500
Why is it like this?

182
00:16:35,299 --> 00:16:37,870
No one lived as tough as you have.

183
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,879
To Ji Su who will be somewhere.

184
00:17:56,879 --> 00:18:00,119
I plan to turn into a different person.

185
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:04,890
If we meet again one day,

186
00:18:07,089 --> 00:18:08,660
even if I'm very different,

187
00:18:10,329 --> 00:18:11,629
please recognize me.

188
00:18:32,816 --> 00:18:34,155
Will that be enough?

189
00:18:35,056 --> 00:18:37,286
He'll come at us with all he's got.

190
00:18:38,755 --> 00:18:40,326
According to Legal,

191
00:18:40,326 --> 00:18:42,395
there's nothing he can find fault with.

192
00:18:43,026 --> 00:18:46,296
They say the prosecutors are likely to go after him instead.

193
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:50,266
Did he not know that?

194
00:18:51,806 --> 00:18:53,675
What is he up to?

195
00:18:54,846 --> 00:18:58,116
I'm on the lookout as nothing has surfaced yet.

196
00:18:58,876 --> 00:19:00,876
- The problem is... - What's the problem?

197
00:19:01,116 --> 00:19:02,786
The ledgers we prepared...

198
00:19:02,786 --> 00:19:04,215
in case of a search and seizure,

199
00:19:04,215 --> 00:19:06,586
the prosecutors took without much of an issue.

200
00:19:08,185 --> 00:19:10,425
It bothers me that they took the past 10 years' worth of...

201
00:19:10,425 --> 00:19:12,925
electronic banking and shareholder meeting minute books.

202
00:19:13,356 --> 00:19:14,725
From our subsidiaries too.

203
00:19:14,725 --> 00:19:17,766
You should've doctored those in advance as well.

204
00:19:17,965 --> 00:19:19,665
It's too much work...

205
00:19:19,665 --> 00:19:22,366
to make sure that the subsidiaries' records correspond...

206
00:19:22,366 --> 00:19:24,606
Why do you make so many excuses these days?

207
00:19:26,705 --> 00:19:28,745
Everyone dies for a reason,

208
00:19:28,745 --> 00:19:30,145
but you have too many reasons.

209
00:19:37,415 --> 00:19:40,356
Mr. Han. The chairman wishes to see you.

210
00:19:45,356 --> 00:19:48,266
I heard you had a busy day yesterday, but you're here early.

211
00:19:49,126 --> 00:19:51,165
You came in early yourself.

212
00:19:51,165 --> 00:19:54,636
I wish the sun would rise earlier each morning.

213
00:19:55,005 --> 00:19:57,306
The joy of work is the joy of life.

214
00:20:01,905 --> 00:20:05,016
What? Do you want me to get to the point?

215
00:20:07,346 --> 00:20:08,445
But then,

216
00:20:09,386 --> 00:20:12,116
I guess our current relationship isn't the kind...

217
00:20:12,116 --> 00:20:13,556
where we exchange niceties.

218
00:20:17,155 --> 00:20:20,225
How far do you want to take this?

219
00:20:23,266 --> 00:20:26,296
Is there no point in asking when we both know the answer?

220
00:20:32,876 --> 00:20:35,145
Do you want to replace me as Hyung Sung's chairman?

221
00:20:39,346 --> 00:20:40,846
All the investigations...

222
00:20:40,846 --> 00:20:42,745
has turned you very silent.

223
00:20:43,086 --> 00:20:45,685
Let's start with the most recent issue.

224
00:20:46,586 --> 00:20:49,155
A prosecutor you became very close with...

225
00:20:49,455 --> 00:20:51,326
searched Seo Kyung's and my offices.

226
00:20:51,755 --> 00:20:54,866
Is it because of Hyung Sung's slush fund and dividends?

227
00:20:54,866 --> 00:20:56,395
They are not Hyung Sung's.

228
00:20:56,995 --> 00:21:00,636
They are your slush fund and dividends.

229
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:04,465
That is your bare face.

230
00:21:04,465 --> 00:21:07,205
I like this. I enjoy such conversations.

231
00:21:07,405 --> 00:21:09,905
Your words are so pungent and pointed.

232
00:21:12,276 --> 00:21:13,376
But...

233
00:21:14,816 --> 00:21:17,856
do you know the law of exception between family?

234
00:21:18,286 --> 00:21:20,255
The dividends and slush fund...

235
00:21:20,255 --> 00:21:21,925
from your borrowed name accounts.

236
00:21:22,725 --> 00:21:25,455
Even if it goes to me or your wife,

237
00:21:26,195 --> 00:21:28,925
none of us can be held legally responsible.

238
00:21:30,465 --> 00:21:33,296
Theft between family isn't legally theft.

239
00:21:34,935 --> 00:21:38,076
The law of exception applies only to those related by blood.

240
00:21:38,336 --> 00:21:41,876
That literally means people who share blood.

241
00:21:42,145 --> 00:21:45,445
Unfortunately for you, sir, we are not related by blood.

242
00:21:46,816 --> 00:21:48,915
As you never failed to stress,

243
00:21:48,915 --> 00:21:52,386
you and I are from different blood.

244
00:21:57,126 --> 00:22:01,425
You want to come after me and leave Seo Kyung out of this.

245
00:22:01,725 --> 00:22:03,866
I didn't take a single cent.

246
00:22:03,866 --> 00:22:05,866
Everything went to Seo Kyung.

247
00:22:06,596 --> 00:22:09,665
You can tell the prosecutors it's my money,

248
00:22:09,665 --> 00:22:11,505
but I'll say it's my daughter's.

249
00:22:12,675 --> 00:22:13,975
You know that...

250
00:22:14,745 --> 00:22:17,376
how much I loathe going to prison.

251
00:22:18,975 --> 00:22:21,116
Even if I have to sell out my daughter,

252
00:22:21,116 --> 00:22:22,816
I won't ever go to prison.

253
00:22:23,245 --> 00:22:24,286
Yes.

254
00:22:25,485 --> 00:22:28,126
I know very well that you will never let that happen.

255
00:22:28,126 --> 00:22:29,786
It's the same for you too.

256
00:22:30,685 --> 00:22:33,155
She's the mother of your son.

257
00:22:33,895 --> 00:22:35,866
You can't let her get locked up in prison.

258
00:22:36,665 --> 00:22:39,266
On top of that, the money she has...

259
00:22:40,165 --> 00:22:42,965
will be your son, Jun Seo's money.

260
00:22:43,235 --> 00:22:44,306
You know that, right?

261
00:22:47,536 --> 00:22:49,046
I'll handle it myself.

262
00:22:50,376 --> 00:22:52,745
Since we're talking about Jun Seo, let's talk about this.

263
00:22:53,175 --> 00:22:56,586
I heard Yoon Ji Su's son physically harmed Jun Seo.

264
00:22:57,546 --> 00:22:59,215
I was asked how I wanted to handle this.

265
00:22:59,215 --> 00:23:01,185
The news reached me too.

266
00:23:01,826 --> 00:23:03,955
What are you getting at?

267
00:23:04,185 --> 00:23:06,155
Don't ask me questions...

268
00:23:07,096 --> 00:23:09,195
you already know the answers to.

269
00:23:16,606 --> 00:23:17,766
Jae Hyun.

270
00:23:19,376 --> 00:23:21,005
Can you spare some of your time today?

271
00:23:21,945 --> 00:23:24,106
I need to talk to you too.

272
00:23:26,846 --> 00:23:28,745
Let's meet there tonight.

273
00:23:30,645 --> 00:23:32,155
Where we started.

274
00:23:35,685 --> 00:23:38,395
So tell me whom you lost.

275
00:23:39,326 --> 00:23:40,626
I told you my story,

276
00:23:40,626 --> 00:23:43,296
but why won't you share yours? It's not fair.

277
00:23:44,165 --> 00:23:47,066
I definitely know what you have lost.

278
00:23:47,796 --> 00:23:48,866
Do you remember it?

279
00:23:48,866 --> 00:23:49,935
Your sanity.

280
00:23:51,205 --> 00:23:52,435
Is that funny?

281
00:23:53,536 --> 00:23:56,846
I like you very much.

282
00:23:57,745 --> 00:23:59,645
Let's date.

283
00:24:00,215 --> 00:24:02,386
What? Gosh.

284
00:24:06,655 --> 00:24:08,655
That's the only ride I cannot go on.

285
00:24:09,985 --> 00:24:12,356
I can ride the scariest rollercoaster here...

286
00:24:12,455 --> 00:24:15,326
with my eyes open and my arms upraised high.

287
00:24:16,326 --> 00:24:19,165
But I just can't ride that one.

288
00:24:19,735 --> 00:24:21,036
Why is that?

289
00:24:24,066 --> 00:24:25,336
My mother...

290
00:24:25,975 --> 00:24:28,376
left me here.

291
00:24:31,675 --> 00:24:35,346
I was only seven years old then.

292
00:24:37,046 --> 00:24:40,516
I'm cruel because I take after my mother.

293
00:24:50,826 --> 00:24:52,235
You must face it to break it.

294
00:24:53,296 --> 00:24:54,435
Break what?

295
00:24:55,866 --> 00:24:56,905
Your trauma.

296
00:24:58,376 --> 00:25:01,136
Do you think I'm really scared of this ride?

297
00:25:01,505 --> 00:25:03,475
It's just boring.

298
00:25:03,546 --> 00:25:04,915
I'm not a little kid.

299
00:25:06,675 --> 00:25:08,745
I'll make it so that the last person...

300
00:25:09,386 --> 00:25:12,485
you saw on this ride isn't your mother.

301
00:26:04,165 --> 00:26:05,536
If you were going to leave me,

302
00:26:07,276 --> 00:26:09,175
you should have disappeared that day.

303
00:26:10,175 --> 00:26:11,445
What is this?

304
00:26:12,516 --> 00:26:13,616
In the end,

305
00:26:14,816 --> 00:26:16,386
I'm being abandoned again.

306
00:26:23,856 --> 00:26:25,395
Let's go back to that time.

307
00:26:26,455 --> 00:26:29,026
I'll leave Se Hwi, be nice to you,

308
00:26:29,266 --> 00:26:30,626
and love only you.

309
00:26:31,096 --> 00:26:33,735
It's not that I wasn't capable of doing these.

310
00:26:34,495 --> 00:26:35,866
I just chose not to.

311
00:26:36,366 --> 00:26:38,435
It got a bit boring.

312
00:26:39,136 --> 00:26:41,806
So I thought I wanted to give you a wake-up call.

313
00:26:43,046 --> 00:26:46,316
I was looking for something fun and new.

314
00:26:47,546 --> 00:26:50,886
But I don't like any of them. It's all boring.

315
00:26:52,955 --> 00:26:54,386
I'm sorry,

316
00:26:56,755 --> 00:26:59,596
but it will feel like we're putting together a broken glass window.

317
00:27:02,225 --> 00:27:03,866
I should apologize to you.

318
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:08,306
I will never let you go.

319
00:27:09,005 --> 00:27:11,935
A broken glass window? Why can't I piece it together?

320
00:27:12,306 --> 00:27:15,505
Since I broke it, I'll put it together.

321
00:27:17,005 --> 00:27:18,276
I can put it together...

322
00:27:19,415 --> 00:27:21,145
flawlessly.

323
00:27:51,245 --> 00:27:53,276
What are you doing, Ms. Yoon?

324
00:27:56,386 --> 00:27:57,546
Ma'am.

325
00:28:03,126 --> 00:28:05,695
I'll find a way.

326
00:28:06,995 --> 00:28:08,566
Can you give me some time?

327
00:28:11,995 --> 00:28:13,866
I didn't want to waste your talent,

328
00:28:14,036 --> 00:28:16,136
so I might have been a bit rash.

329
00:28:16,505 --> 00:28:18,336
What does "rash" mean?

330
00:28:22,806 --> 00:28:24,776
Because I wanted something badly,

331
00:28:24,776 --> 00:28:26,745
I ran, but I ended up falling.

332
00:28:28,645 --> 00:28:32,056
Do we have to take some time to want something?

333
00:28:34,356 --> 00:28:35,586
Right.

334
00:28:36,326 --> 00:28:38,655
We should take our time to want something,

335
00:28:42,126 --> 00:28:45,195
but once you want something, it's hard to stop.

336
00:28:46,695 --> 00:28:49,665
I think I was that too.

337
00:28:51,876 --> 00:28:53,276
I was rash.

338
00:28:54,576 --> 00:28:58,576
I bragged to Yu Bin that you were going...

339
00:28:58,576 --> 00:29:00,816
to teach me how to play the piano.

340
00:29:02,445 --> 00:29:04,745
That's not your fault. It's mine.

341
00:29:05,086 --> 00:29:07,316
It's natural for you to want to brag about it.

342
00:29:07,455 --> 00:29:09,755
Trying to do this secretly was my mistake.

343
00:29:11,326 --> 00:29:13,056
What will we do then?

344
00:29:14,326 --> 00:29:17,526
I should open up my own piano academy.

345
00:29:28,005 --> 00:29:32,376
(For Rent)

346
00:29:37,745 --> 00:29:40,116
Don't let anyone see you. Hide here.

347
00:29:40,685 --> 00:29:42,155
I'll bring some money.

348
00:29:49,695 --> 00:29:51,225
Hello, ma'am.

349
00:29:51,225 --> 00:29:53,536
Hello, Ms. Yoon.

350
00:29:59,036 --> 00:30:00,636
Yu Bin's mother...

351
00:30:00,675 --> 00:30:03,376
found out that you didn't graduate college.

352
00:30:04,546 --> 00:30:07,076
You know that Yu Bin and Byeol are in the same class, right?

353
00:30:08,586 --> 00:30:10,546
You gave Byeol a free lesson.

354
00:30:10,586 --> 00:30:12,985
That caused trouble for your job here.

355
00:30:19,596 --> 00:30:21,766
(Jae Hyun)

356
00:30:33,836 --> 00:30:36,846
Then, does it mean you're unemployed?

357
00:30:37,346 --> 00:30:39,745
No. I have a lot of private lessons.

358
00:30:41,745 --> 00:30:43,145
Will that do?

359
00:30:44,346 --> 00:30:45,516
What do you mean?

360
00:30:46,715 --> 00:30:47,985
To make ends meet?

361
00:30:49,326 --> 00:30:50,725
I should make it work.

362
00:30:53,225 --> 00:30:56,695
I can make it work. I don't spend much money.

363
00:30:57,296 --> 00:31:00,695
So losing my job at the academy won't be any problem for me.

364
00:31:04,266 --> 00:31:07,606
Here. This is my personal card, not the corporate card.

365
00:31:08,505 --> 00:31:10,606
The company can't track it. And it doesn't have a limit.

366
00:31:11,576 --> 00:31:13,215
Are you testing me?

367
00:31:13,776 --> 00:31:17,086
"Will you say no to this too?"

368
00:31:17,286 --> 00:31:18,915
I want to help you.

369
00:31:19,616 --> 00:31:21,925
I can't think of any ways to help you except for financially...

370
00:31:21,925 --> 00:31:24,386
to make up for the past 25 years. It's torturing me too.

371
00:31:25,056 --> 00:31:27,556
I didn't know that I lacked imaginations.

372
00:31:27,556 --> 00:31:29,566
Then, you should improve on it.

373
00:31:29,866 --> 00:31:32,066
Use that money to take lessons or go to an academy.

374
00:31:39,435 --> 00:31:40,735
She hasn't changed.

375
00:31:44,876 --> 00:31:46,116
Is it you, Hye Jung?

376
00:31:52,116 --> 00:31:53,415
I didn't order anything.

377
00:31:53,616 --> 00:31:55,185
Aren't you Ms. Yoon Ji Su?

378
00:31:55,586 --> 00:31:56,786
Yes, I am.

379
00:31:59,096 --> 00:32:00,895
My gosh, what's all that?

380
00:32:01,195 --> 00:32:03,126
I see. Will a war break out tomorrow?

381
00:32:04,026 --> 00:32:07,766
Gosh, is this a house or a supermarket?

382
00:32:08,606 --> 00:32:10,106
Do you want to take some of it?

383
00:32:10,836 --> 00:32:12,036
Where did you get all of this?

384
00:32:12,175 --> 00:32:14,336
There's no way you'd buy this much food.

385
00:32:14,536 --> 00:32:16,445
You're a cheapskate who buys rice by the bag.

386
00:32:16,846 --> 00:32:20,675
Hey, did you get registered as someone in need?

387
00:32:20,675 --> 00:32:22,915
Is this from a charity or something?

388
00:32:24,316 --> 00:32:25,516
It's from Jae Hyun.

389
00:32:27,786 --> 00:32:29,185
You're still meeting him?

390
00:32:29,526 --> 00:32:31,326
Sit down. I'll cook you something delicious.

391
00:32:31,856 --> 00:32:32,925
Forget it.

392
00:32:33,255 --> 00:32:35,096
How can I eat here? It's too disturbing.

393
00:32:36,495 --> 00:32:37,695
Let's eat out.

394
00:32:38,796 --> 00:32:39,866
Shall we?

395
00:32:40,435 --> 00:32:42,705
I thought you quit drinking. You haven't been here for a while.

396
00:32:43,435 --> 00:32:45,876
I couldn't come because I'm busy trying to make a living.

397
00:32:46,705 --> 00:32:48,376
I won't charge you. Just come.

398
00:32:49,276 --> 00:32:51,276
Does your liquor fall from the sky?

399
00:32:51,276 --> 00:32:53,616
I'm sure you use your cards to buy the liquor and ingredients.

400
00:32:53,616 --> 00:32:54,945
How could I drink it for free?

401
00:32:55,175 --> 00:32:57,046
Anyway, credit card statements scare me the most.

402
00:32:57,046 --> 00:32:58,685
I hope the 25th of the month doesn't exist.

403
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:01,086
It could go like this. 23rd, 24th, and 26th.

404
00:33:01,086 --> 00:33:02,625
Then, you won't get paid either.

405
00:33:02,625 --> 00:33:04,956
I should change the date of my payment then.

406
00:33:12,996 --> 00:33:14,896
Why aren't you drinking?

407
00:33:17,105 --> 00:33:18,136
It's just because.

408
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:24,545
How will you break this awkwardness? Did you two fight?

409
00:33:24,746 --> 00:33:26,616
We didn't fight.

410
00:33:26,616 --> 00:33:28,375
Do you fight with your fingers?

411
00:33:28,375 --> 00:33:30,985
- Fingers? - Fingers I can't hurt.

412
00:33:36,386 --> 00:33:39,525
Be careful. She might be your middle finger.

413
00:33:39,826 --> 00:33:40,896
In that case...

414
00:33:44,195 --> 00:33:45,735
Don't do that.

415
00:33:46,666 --> 00:33:50,335
My gosh. Don't smile at me. You look gorgeous.

416
00:33:51,105 --> 00:33:52,936
This is why he can't give you up.

417
00:34:51,996 --> 00:34:53,465
Thank you for everything, Young Woo.

418
00:34:56,235 --> 00:34:57,335
And I'm sorry.

419
00:35:30,405 --> 00:35:32,076
- Hello? - Hi.

420
00:35:32,235 --> 00:35:33,976
This is the sanatorium.

421
00:35:34,105 --> 00:35:35,206
I see. Hello.

422
00:35:35,206 --> 00:35:39,715
By the way, I was wondering if you could come by today.

423
00:35:40,076 --> 00:35:41,476
What is this about?

424
00:35:41,775 --> 00:35:43,945
Mr. Yoon is asking for you.

425
00:35:45,715 --> 00:35:47,456
Did something happen to him again?

426
00:35:47,786 --> 00:35:51,125
No. Actually, he's doing better.

427
00:35:51,125 --> 00:35:52,695
He's lucid.

428
00:35:54,355 --> 00:35:55,465
I see.

429
00:36:10,405 --> 00:36:11,476
Sir.

430
00:36:15,786 --> 00:36:17,146
I heard you asked for me.

431
00:36:17,985 --> 00:36:19,085
Do you want...

432
00:36:20,116 --> 00:36:22,056
some fresh air?

433
00:36:40,105 --> 00:36:41,335
Don't...

434
00:36:42,246 --> 00:36:44,275
forgive me.

435
00:36:47,076 --> 00:36:48,175
I'll be okay...

436
00:36:50,085 --> 00:36:51,346
if you push me...

437
00:36:52,485 --> 00:36:55,456
from this cliff now.

438
00:37:04,866 --> 00:37:06,536
What are you talking about?

439
00:37:08,235 --> 00:37:10,505
Ji Su didn't do anything wrong.

440
00:37:11,036 --> 00:37:12,375
So...

441
00:37:14,476 --> 00:37:17,005
you should punish me for everything.

442
00:37:20,146 --> 00:37:21,976
I can't let my daughter...

443
00:37:23,886 --> 00:37:26,386
be in any more pain.

444
00:37:33,795 --> 00:37:35,596
The one who prosecuted...

445
00:37:38,096 --> 00:37:41,136
your father for illegal labor acts...

446
00:37:44,666 --> 00:37:46,105
was me.

447
00:37:53,715 --> 00:37:54,715
(May 1995)

448
00:37:54,715 --> 00:37:56,045
The summer that year...

449
00:37:57,045 --> 00:38:00,315
That was the summer when my life had stopped.

450
00:38:00,556 --> 00:38:03,355
When you ran away with Ji Su,

451
00:38:04,425 --> 00:38:07,525
your father reported the management of Hyung Sung Group...

452
00:38:07,525 --> 00:38:09,425
to the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office...

453
00:38:09,425 --> 00:38:11,565
for disbanding the labor union.

454
00:38:12,866 --> 00:38:14,396
As soon as I heard about it,

455
00:38:14,396 --> 00:38:16,706
I knew he was your father.

456
00:38:18,036 --> 00:38:23,576
That time, I was utterly enraged against you and Ji Su.

457
00:38:24,306 --> 00:38:27,746
And your father showed up in front of me.

458
00:38:28,445 --> 00:38:30,416
And so did Chairman Jang San.

459
00:38:32,146 --> 00:38:34,815
Chairman Jang asked me to quash...

460
00:38:34,815 --> 00:38:38,456
your father's report against Hyung Sung Group.

461
00:38:39,195 --> 00:38:40,755
But instead of doing so,

462
00:38:42,155 --> 00:38:45,125
I made them prosecute your dad.

463
00:38:47,936 --> 00:38:51,706
I used the evidence your father submitted...

464
00:38:51,706 --> 00:38:53,775
to report Hyung Sung Group's crimes...

465
00:38:54,806 --> 00:38:58,246
and framed your father for those crimes.

466
00:38:59,916 --> 00:39:02,076
Your father was in despair.

467
00:39:02,485 --> 00:39:04,445
Chairman Jang was happy.

468
00:39:05,315 --> 00:39:07,355
And I was satisfied.

469
00:39:09,025 --> 00:39:10,425
Chairman Jang...

470
00:39:11,025 --> 00:39:14,456
promised to support me so I could become a politician.

471
00:39:15,425 --> 00:39:18,726
I felt as if the deeper my rage for you and Ji Su became,

472
00:39:19,096 --> 00:39:21,235
the bigger my reward became.

473
00:39:22,405 --> 00:39:24,735
I told myself that I was livid,

474
00:39:25,436 --> 00:39:27,436
but I was smiling.

475
00:39:28,436 --> 00:39:32,976
And that summer, my life came to an end.

476
00:39:36,786 --> 00:39:37,815
I had lost...

477
00:39:39,155 --> 00:39:42,625
a house and a family to return to.

478
00:39:43,826 --> 00:39:47,396
I lost my job and career.

479
00:39:48,195 --> 00:39:50,896
I didn't know the meaning of the scale...

480
00:39:52,195 --> 00:39:57,036
Lady Justice was holding in front of the courthouse.

481
00:39:58,636 --> 00:40:00,405
And I had forgotten...

482
00:40:01,335 --> 00:40:04,275
the warning of the sword which she held in the other hand.

483
00:40:07,775 --> 00:40:09,116
That summer,

484
00:40:10,686 --> 00:40:11,945
it only took a moment...

485
00:40:16,056 --> 00:40:18,125
for me to lose everything.

486
00:40:19,155 --> 00:40:20,956
Ever since then,

487
00:40:23,565 --> 00:40:26,036
my clock stopped running.

488
00:40:30,065 --> 00:40:31,405
Now,

489
00:40:33,735 --> 00:40:37,246
my body wants to stop running as well.

490
00:40:43,215 --> 00:40:46,485
I am truly sorry.

491
00:40:53,795 --> 00:40:56,125
The crime I have committed against you...

492
00:40:57,666 --> 00:41:00,195
is too grave and deep.

493
00:41:03,366 --> 00:41:04,536
Please...

494
00:41:05,605 --> 00:41:08,875
accept my apology.

495
00:41:36,266 --> 00:41:38,266
Did something happen at the sanatorium?

496
00:41:38,266 --> 00:41:39,576
You don't look good at all.

497
00:42:04,195 --> 00:42:05,226
Jun Seo.

498
00:42:08,195 --> 00:42:09,565
Do you want to go on a trip with me?

499
00:42:13,036 --> 00:42:15,275
We can go camping, like last time,

500
00:42:15,706 --> 00:42:17,576
or we can go night fishing.

501
00:42:18,346 --> 00:42:20,076
Or we can go hiking.

502
00:42:23,215 --> 00:42:25,886
There's a beach in Gangneung...

503
00:42:25,886 --> 00:42:27,655
and other fun things to do.

504
00:42:31,886 --> 00:42:33,855
There are more exciting things to do...

505
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:36,565
outside that small world in your hand,

506
00:42:38,795 --> 00:42:40,036
so give it a thought.

507
00:42:53,146 --> 00:42:54,215
Dad.

508
00:42:58,786 --> 00:42:59,985
You're late.

509
00:43:00,355 --> 00:43:02,956
You must have a lot of plans since it's your first leave.

510
00:43:03,755 --> 00:43:05,085
Why are you out here?

511
00:43:06,295 --> 00:43:08,056
And why are you smoking again?

512
00:43:09,525 --> 00:43:13,366
I was just having a hard time falling asleep.

513
00:43:19,976 --> 00:43:21,105
Let's go inside.

514
00:43:26,916 --> 00:43:30,445
He left this so you can get something to eat before you go back.

515
00:43:30,445 --> 00:43:32,386
I guess that's why he's working.

516
00:43:41,855 --> 00:43:45,266
What kind of work is Dad doing?

517
00:43:45,596 --> 00:43:47,636
He won't say,

518
00:43:48,335 --> 00:43:51,565
but he always comes back with his hands all dirty,

519
00:43:51,766 --> 00:43:54,076
so it can't be anything easy.

520
00:43:58,675 --> 00:44:00,346
It looks like he gave me...

521
00:44:01,646 --> 00:44:03,146
his whole daily pay.

522
00:44:03,146 --> 00:44:04,985
(30 dollars)

523
00:45:10,116 --> 00:45:11,416
How are things going?

524
00:45:12,616 --> 00:45:13,815
Nothing special.

525
00:45:14,585 --> 00:45:17,786
I played several parts, but I'm not getting any leads.

526
00:45:19,755 --> 00:45:22,666
Why do you keep seeing me?

527
00:45:22,666 --> 00:45:23,795
Obviously...

528
00:45:26,396 --> 00:45:27,536
because I like you.

529
00:45:29,936 --> 00:45:32,105
Me or my money?

530
00:45:34,806 --> 00:45:36,146
What's up with you today?

531
00:45:36,505 --> 00:45:39,545
Did something happen at home again?

532
00:45:42,315 --> 00:45:46,085
You don't want me to get a divorce, do you?

533
00:45:47,215 --> 00:45:49,155
That way you can toy with me for a while...

534
00:45:49,155 --> 00:45:51,056
and then move on elsewhere.

535
00:45:53,326 --> 00:45:54,396
You're right.

536
00:45:55,625 --> 00:45:57,326
I don't want you to get a divorce.

537
00:46:00,436 --> 00:46:02,065
Because I think you'd have a hard time.

538
00:46:07,306 --> 00:46:08,875
I know you still love him a lot.

539
00:46:10,275 --> 00:46:11,306
Your husband.

540
00:46:14,045 --> 00:46:17,516
I'm sorry. I'm practicing this these days.

541
00:46:31,402 --> 00:46:33,573
I have a lesson, so have the lunch box...

542
00:46:33,573 --> 00:46:36,002
and fruit when Grandpa wakes up.

543
00:46:37,542 --> 00:46:39,542
What if Grandpa gets mad?

544
00:46:39,942 --> 00:46:41,743
He doesn't even remember me.

545
00:46:41,743 --> 00:46:43,183
You'll be better off, then.

546
00:46:43,442 --> 00:46:45,683
He doesn't get mad at strangers.

547
00:46:45,843 --> 00:46:46,882
I'll be back.

548
00:46:47,783 --> 00:46:48,882
Okay.

549
00:47:13,873 --> 00:47:15,113
Hello.

550
00:47:15,113 --> 00:47:16,143
Yes.

551
00:47:17,913 --> 00:47:19,982
You should put on some weight.

552
00:47:20,352 --> 00:47:23,823
You're so scrawny, just like your mother.

553
00:47:25,823 --> 00:47:28,723
What grade are you in, again?

554
00:47:30,022 --> 00:47:31,422
Eight grade, sir.

555
00:47:32,163 --> 00:47:33,332
Right.

556
00:47:34,292 --> 00:47:36,832
Do middle schoolers play with these?

557
00:47:37,263 --> 00:47:40,502
I brought these for you because I thought you were younger.

558
00:47:41,132 --> 00:47:44,473
I don't have anything else to give you.

559
00:47:44,873 --> 00:47:47,013
It's okay, sir. I like these.

560
00:47:47,373 --> 00:47:48,712
Is that so?

561
00:47:49,783 --> 00:47:52,183
Then take this.

562
00:47:52,812 --> 00:47:54,482
And this too.

563
00:47:55,513 --> 00:47:57,683
And this.

564
00:47:58,422 --> 00:48:00,422
Take this as well.

565
00:48:02,962 --> 00:48:06,433
But this isn't for free.

566
00:48:07,763 --> 00:48:08,832
Sorry?

567
00:48:09,462 --> 00:48:13,232
I'm giving these for you to listen to your mother...

568
00:48:13,332 --> 00:48:15,832
and always take her side.

569
00:48:17,402 --> 00:48:18,442
Yes, sir.

570
00:48:19,143 --> 00:48:23,843
Your mother has gone through so much,

571
00:48:24,843 --> 00:48:28,212
so you need to make her happy...

572
00:48:29,252 --> 00:48:30,922
by supporting her...

573
00:48:31,723 --> 00:48:33,623
and taking her side.

574
00:48:34,593 --> 00:48:37,962
The two of you need to live...

575
00:48:38,292 --> 00:48:39,832
happily ever after...

576
00:48:40,863 --> 00:48:44,332
for a long long time, okay?

577
00:49:07,393 --> 00:49:08,993
Are you sure you won't regret it?

578
00:49:09,692 --> 00:49:10,922
Quitting school.

579
00:49:14,792 --> 00:49:16,062
Yes.

580
00:49:16,062 --> 00:49:18,163
And you won't say why you got into that fight?

581
00:49:18,933 --> 00:49:20,232
I'm sorry.

582
00:49:23,143 --> 00:49:24,303
But Young Min,

583
00:49:24,672 --> 00:49:26,102
you are in the worst situation...

584
00:49:27,373 --> 00:49:29,882
when it comes to childcare.

585
00:49:30,843 --> 00:49:32,982
That means I can win you back 99 percent...

586
00:49:32,982 --> 00:49:35,613
if I file a lawsuit.

587
00:49:36,082 --> 00:49:39,252
So you'd be better off telling me.

588
00:49:40,223 --> 00:49:43,422
Why you got into that fight, and why you decided to drop out.

589
00:49:44,062 --> 00:49:46,763
If it's a financial reason,

590
00:49:46,863 --> 00:49:48,533
I have no other choice but to bring you back.

591
00:49:48,632 --> 00:49:50,263
It's not like that.

592
00:49:50,462 --> 00:49:52,732
Then what is it?

593
00:50:02,413 --> 00:50:06,312
But I think I will like living with you as well.

594
00:50:13,852 --> 00:50:16,053
(Caregiver)

595
00:50:17,363 --> 00:50:19,493
- Yes, ma'am? - Ms. Yoon,

596
00:50:19,493 --> 00:50:22,763
your father suddenly showed difficulty in breathing,

597
00:50:22,832 --> 00:50:25,232
so he was taken to the ER.

598
00:50:33,913 --> 00:50:35,373
His pneumonia symptoms worsened,

599
00:50:35,973 --> 00:50:37,942
so he currently can not breathe on his own.

600
00:50:45,482 --> 00:50:51,062
(Intensive Care Unit)

601
00:51:00,332 --> 00:51:01,533
Ji Su.

602
00:51:02,033 --> 00:51:04,502
I got a call from Hye Jung. She told me to hurry ahead.

603
00:51:05,803 --> 00:51:06,843
I see.

604
00:51:07,573 --> 00:51:09,783
What's going on?

605
00:51:12,343 --> 00:51:16,053
He had pneumonia, and it worsened.

606
00:51:29,033 --> 00:51:31,433
Were you surprised to get my call?

607
00:51:32,363 --> 00:51:33,933
Yes, a bit.

608
00:51:34,433 --> 00:51:37,303
We don't know how long your mom will have to stay at the hospital,

609
00:51:37,303 --> 00:51:39,812
so she said you can spend the night at my place...

610
00:51:39,812 --> 00:51:41,743
and come to the hospital tomorrow morning.

611
00:51:42,143 --> 00:51:43,212
Okay.

612
00:51:43,812 --> 00:51:49,013
Oh, and my husband may look a bit threatening,

613
00:51:49,183 --> 00:51:51,582
but he isn't a bad guy, so don't worry and eat with him.

614
00:51:52,082 --> 00:51:54,493
Then, you can watch TV...

615
00:51:54,922 --> 00:51:56,792
or study if you'd like to.

616
00:51:58,323 --> 00:52:01,493
But is Grandpa okay?

617
00:52:01,493 --> 00:52:02,632
Hey.

618
00:52:03,562 --> 00:52:06,402
Your grandpa is a strong man.

619
00:52:06,873 --> 00:52:08,132
You may not know it,

620
00:52:08,132 --> 00:52:11,402
but he used to be one of the top three...

621
00:52:11,402 --> 00:52:14,042
strongest men in the country.

622
00:52:15,473 --> 00:52:16,683
He looked skinny.

623
00:52:16,843 --> 00:52:19,542
Not strong like a wrestler,

624
00:52:19,542 --> 00:52:22,053
but like taking in bad guys and so.

625
00:52:23,082 --> 00:52:24,223
That power.

626
00:52:25,382 --> 00:52:26,422
Okay.

627
00:52:30,893 --> 00:52:33,663
(Dong Jin)

628
00:52:35,462 --> 00:52:36,602
What?

629
00:52:36,602 --> 00:52:38,663
What do you say we go to Young Woo's bar tonight?

630
00:52:39,002 --> 00:52:41,172
I landed some extra cash.

631
00:52:41,772 --> 00:52:43,902
Goodness, you.

632
00:52:43,902 --> 00:52:47,473
This is not the time for that.

633
00:52:57,123 --> 00:52:59,183
- Yes, Dong Jin. - Aren't you going to the hospital?

634
00:53:00,022 --> 00:53:01,652
- Hospital? - I knew it.

635
00:53:01,652 --> 00:53:03,123
Of course, Ji Su didn't tell you.

636
00:53:03,493 --> 00:53:04,562
What are you talking about?

637
00:53:05,123 --> 00:53:08,292
Ji Su's father is in the ICU right now.

638
00:53:12,502 --> 00:53:14,502
(Intensive Care Unit)

639
00:53:18,973 --> 00:53:20,442
Are you Mr. Yoon Hyung Gu's guardian?

640
00:53:21,073 --> 00:53:22,913
Do you have any other family members heading over?

641
00:53:23,683 --> 00:53:25,113
Not anymore.

642
00:53:25,743 --> 00:53:27,382
He does have a young grandchild, though.

643
00:53:27,712 --> 00:53:31,823
I think you should come in and spend your final moments.

644
00:54:03,683 --> 00:54:05,852
Doesn't he need to have the ventilator on?

645
00:54:05,852 --> 00:54:07,553
He signed the papers saying he will forego...

646
00:54:07,553 --> 00:54:08,993
any life-sustaining treatment.

647
00:54:12,922 --> 00:54:15,562
I'm sorry, Ji Su.

648
00:54:18,763 --> 00:54:21,873
If you're really sorry, then you need to get back up.

649
00:54:22,703 --> 00:54:23,843
I never...

650
00:54:24,873 --> 00:54:27,772
gave you a proper hug.

651
00:54:30,982 --> 00:54:34,252
No, it's okay.

652
00:54:35,312 --> 00:54:36,382
I will take...

653
00:54:37,553 --> 00:54:40,422
all the wicked things I have done...

654
00:54:41,993 --> 00:54:44,593
and the burden...

655
00:54:46,093 --> 00:54:49,462
I had given you with me,

656
00:54:50,363 --> 00:54:51,462
so that...

657
00:54:53,573 --> 00:54:57,042
you will only be left with the good things.

658
00:55:00,473 --> 00:55:01,573
Make sure...

659
00:55:03,482 --> 00:55:06,752
to live happily, Ji Su.

660
00:55:14,553 --> 00:55:18,292
Dad, I'm so sorry.

661
00:55:23,933 --> 00:55:25,763
Dad.

662
00:55:26,363 --> 00:55:28,203
Make sure to tell Mom and Ji Young...

663
00:55:29,703 --> 00:55:32,172
that I'm sorry.

664
00:55:33,002 --> 00:55:34,113
Okay?

665
00:55:35,013 --> 00:55:36,113
Dad?

666
00:55:39,442 --> 00:55:41,982
Dad!

667
00:55:44,323 --> 00:55:45,852
Dad!

668
00:57:08,033 --> 00:57:09,132
I don't want...

669
00:57:15,113 --> 00:57:17,783
anyone to leave me anymore.

670
00:58:17,073 --> 00:58:18,942
(When My Love Blooms)

671
00:58:19,803 --> 00:58:23,413
The one your father hated the most was me.

672
00:58:24,613 --> 00:58:27,283
I couldn't dare say it to you,

673
00:58:27,683 --> 00:58:31,252
so I'm leaving this letter.

674
00:58:31,982 --> 00:58:33,283
The chief prosecutor is who?

675
00:58:33,852 --> 00:58:37,422
The people may be dead, but the facts live on.

676
00:58:37,663 --> 00:58:41,663
I really don't want anyone to leave me anymore, but...

677
00:58:42,732 --> 00:58:43,832
It's all right.

678
00:58:45,033 --> 00:58:46,263
Everything will be all right now.
