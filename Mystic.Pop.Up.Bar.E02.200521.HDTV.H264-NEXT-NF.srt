ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGION AND INCIDENTS

00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:15,890
PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

4
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,690
This is only our third date.

5
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:27,690
Don't you think we're moving too fast?

6
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:33,320
Do you still want me to wait
when I've already held back twice?

7
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:36,700
How can I when I have such

8
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:39,080
a beautiful girlfriend?

9
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:41,040
Your girlfriend?

10
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:44,580
Does that mean
this is our first day as a couple?

11

13
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,070
He sure is enjoying himself.

14
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:14,150
Poor thing...

15
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,990
Wake him up already.
It's time to sign the contract.

16
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:21,080
Isn't that a bit too mean?
He's just getting started.

17
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:33,340
I'm sorry, Special Case.

18
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,630
I don't want to do this, but...

19
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,300
Hey, wake up!

20
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,510
Where is she?

21
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:44,310
Where did she go?

22
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,640
How was the dream I designed for you?

23
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:48,980
Didn't it make up
for all those missed chances?

24
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,310
What?

25
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,900
Have I been cured then?

26
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,230
Not exactly.

27
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,570
That was just a sneak peek.

28
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,780
Sign the contract and work for a month,

29
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,120
then I'll grant your wish.

30
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,660
Work for you for a month?

31
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:06,160
What's with that sigh?

32
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:08,540
You only have to touch nine people.

33
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:09,870
No? Forget it then.

34
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,670
That's not it.
Let me at least read it first.

35
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:19,680
I don't know
if I should be doing this though.

36
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:23,140
Some people may want
to keep their worries hidden,

37
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,970
so who am I to make them talk?

38
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:26,970
Come on, now.

39
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,810
What's the problem
when I'll be solving their issues

40
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:31,690
right away?

41
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,400
We're doing them a favor. Don't you agree?

42
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,770
I'm right, aren't I?

43
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,280
Yes, of course. You're absolutely right.

44
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,910
ARTICLE 4: DURATION, ARTICLE 5: OBLIGATION

45
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:45,870
ARTICLE 6

46
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:49,370
"Your spiritual vision may be enhanced
during work

47
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,290
and the effects may be permanent."

48
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,420
-What does this mean?
-Well...

49
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,920
It's nothing. Don't worry about it.

50
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:02,130
It doesn't seem like "nothing."

51
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,640
Your ability doesn't work on us.

52
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:11,440
Let me be brutally honest with you.

53
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,690
A spiritual vision

54
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:16,110
is like a passage that connects
the Living Realm with the Afterlife.

55
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,190
You're a special case
whose spiritual vision is still intact.

56
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:22,030
Working with us

57
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:24,280
might cause your spiritual vision
to expand.

58
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,830
Even though we enter dreams,

59
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:30,250
we still travel back and forth
on the road that leads to the Afterlife.

60
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:31,750
What will happen to me then?

61
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:35,210
Well, it could cause people

62
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:37,630
to spill their guts out

63
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:41,010
from just brushing against you
or just looking at you.

64
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:42,550
What?

65
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,840
Just by looking at me?

66
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:48,350
That'll never happen, so don't worry.

67
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,390
Bring me nine people within one month

68
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,020
and I'll fix this condition for you.

69
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:55,230
Must I tell you again
that it's my specialty?

70
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:58,110
What if I can't do it in one month?
Won't you help me then?

71
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:01,280
It's not that she won't,
she can't help you.

72
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,610
This hag will be dragged away
if she doesn't meet quotas.

73
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,660
You'll be dragged away?

74
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:09,790
It's the same story for any employee.

75
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:13,460
Even in our world,
if you can't meet your quota,

76
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,830
you're forcibly transferred.

77
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,880
Then what about me?

78
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,500
You'll be stuck like that forever.

79
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:20,710
Forever in a worsened state?

80
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,180
What the hell?

81
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:28,140
I'm sorry, but I can't agree to this.

82
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:30,930
I wouldn't have come
if I knew there was a catch.

83
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:34,390
I'm telling you not to worry.

84
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,980
I solved the issues of
99,991 people until now.

85
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,230
Nine more is a piece of cake.

86
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:43,860
But you're trying to hire me
because you can't do it.

87
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,370
Anyway, I'm out.

88
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,880
Hey.

89
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,340
You.

90
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,840
Me?

91
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,380
Yes, you.

92
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:07,180
I'm going to kill you tonight

93
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,220
and walk into hell myself.

94
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:16,020
-Don't come any closer.
-Let go of this.

95
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,350
-Get away!
-You're dead.

96
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,730
-Wait.
-Get back here!

97
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,230
Goodness.

98
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,110
Just by looking at me?

99
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,910
I can't let that happen.

100
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:33,240
It's too much of a gamble.

101
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,370
-<i>Kang-bae, are you in there?</i>
-Ms. Andong?

102
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,040
-Ma'am, come on in.
-<i>Right.</i>

103
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:43,710
-Goodness.
-Good evening.

104
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:47,800
I thought you'd be a little peckish,
so I brought you these.

105
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:49,590
They look delicious.

106
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,390
Thank you for always looking out for me.

107
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:55,220
It's my pleasure to help out
a hard-working young man.

108
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:56,980
Thank you for the food.

109
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:01,060
Eun-su's wedding is on May 9, right?

110
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:03,270
Isn't that on her birthday?

111
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,190
That's right.

112
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,070
She's getting married on her birthday.

113
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:13,330
Are you going to come to the wedding
instead of seeing your girlfriend?

114
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:16,290
How can I miss Eun-su's wedding?

115
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,710
Besides, I don't have

116
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,210
a girlfriend.

117
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,390
But Weol-ju...

118
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,470
What?

119
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,980
Is there even a way to cure Special Case?

120
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,980
All I have to do is
take him to the Dream World

121
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:46,070
and shut down his spiritual vision.

122
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,230
That's simple enough.

123
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,570
All he needs to do is sign the deal,

124
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,030
but how do I get him to do so?

125
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,450
Don't I know it.

126
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:58,830
Right?

127
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01,540
-It's good.
-It's a proper meal...

128
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:06,380
Ms. Weol-ju?

129
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:12,590
You guys must have had
a tough day at work.

130
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,970
Please dig in.

131
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:15,760
Who is she?

132
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,220
She's someone I know.

133
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:22,560
May I ask how you know
our employee Mr. Han?

134
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:24,400
Me?

135
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:26,820
I run a small business in the neighborhood

136
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,740
and I'm here to offer Mr. Han a job.

137
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:30,820
A job?

138
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,820
We're not in the same business,
so don't worry.

139
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,330
We'll have him work briefly
at night with me,

140
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:38,370
so he can work both jobs.

141
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:39,410
At night?

142
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,960
What kind of business
are you talking about?

143
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,540
Well...

144
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,380
I...

145
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,260
will wait for you in the car, ma'am.

146
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:58,720
Hey.

147
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:04,600
I can't go into any details,

148
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:08,440
but I offer comfort to customers
by serving them alcohol.

149
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:10,190
So a bar

150
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,030
-that only opens at night?
-It's obvious.

151
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:15,360
Mr. Han is just the talent
that I've been looking for,

152
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:18,450
so I have taken the liberty of
offering him the job in person.

153
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,540
Talent? Kang-bae?

154
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,000
What kind of a talent?

155
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,960
It's not about what he's good at.

156
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,330
Let's just say that
he has the perfect physical trait.

157
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,460
He wins over my customers
like nobody's business.

158
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,470
-The perfect physical trait?
-No way.

159
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:38,180
Could we talk in private?

160
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,390
Enjoy your lunch then, everyone.

161
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:41,720
-Have a good day too.
-Come on!

162
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,810
I already said no.
You can't come in here like this.

163
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,110
It's a crime to let talent go to waste.

164
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:54,990
True happiness finds you
when you do something you're good at.

165
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:56,700
And this can help you.

166
00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:00,030
You'll be happy, I'll be happy,
everyone will be happy.

167
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:04,410
No matter how hard it is for me,
I'm going to live my life as it is.

168
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,080
I've been coping
without my limbs just fine.

169
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:09,340
I don't want to gamble and go blind.

170
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:11,050
You should leave.

171
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,850
If I were going to cave in easily,
I wouldn't have come.

172
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:25,940
Here we go.
The surprise discount starts now.

173
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,310
Marinated pork!

174
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:31,190
Sold to just five people for only 990 won.

175
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:34,440
Hurry up, everyone.
Run, ladies. Yes, run for it.

176
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,360
Five, four, three, two, one.

177
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:39,280
Let the discount begin!

178
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:41,490
What the hell are you doing?

179
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:43,950
This.

180
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:49,000
-A discount?
-What?

181
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,140
Young man, hear me out.

182
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,600
I think my husband is cheating on me.

183
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,510
Move!

184
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,100
I think my kid is going
to flunk the entrance exam again.

185
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,690
My mother-in-law is driving me nuts.

186
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:11,060
-Young man!
-Hear me out too.

187
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,230
Over here.

188
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,730
-Hear me out.
-Me too.

189
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,530
My husband...

190
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:18,990
-I'm sorry.
-Young man!

191
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:26,910
-At least hear me out.
-Let us talk.

192
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,330
-Don't go.
-Stop running.

193
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:30,000
-Come on.
-Where are you going?

194
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:46,850
Should I tell them where you are?

195
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,020
You're unbelievable.

196
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,400
The ladies are coming.

197
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:54,190
Where did he go?

198
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:56,110
I wasn't done talking.

199
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,860
I need 15 more days

200
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,950
to tell him about my evil mother-in-law.

201
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:02,410
I have a lot to tell him too.

202
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:06,160
-Ladies!
-Okay, fine. I'll do it.

203
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,790
I'll do it.

204
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:19,380
I'm glad you changed your mind.
You can't live like this.

205
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:20,920
Do you need a pen?

206
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,680
Okay, fine.

207
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:26,470
How about a test run first?

208
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,680
-What?
-We'll try it with one person

209
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:30,180
and think of it as an internship.

210
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,020
Then I'll be able to know

211
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,060
if I'm cut out to meet your quota.

212
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,570
We'll finalize the deal afterwards.
What do you say?

213
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:39,860
Jeez.

214
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:42,530
Your cautiousness will be your downfall,

215
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:43,860
but fine.

216
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:46,910
Be at the bar later then.

217
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,920
Why on earth would you buy me
something so expensive?

218
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
You know I can't even wear makeup.

219
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:00,090
These are organic products
that are mild enough

220
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:02,300
for people who are allergic to cosmetics.

221
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:06,430
You need a pop of color
since it's my wedding day.

222
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:09,310
It doesn't make a difference
if they're organic or not.

223
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,100
Use these yourself

224
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,560
and explain my condition
to your future in-laws

225
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,520
so that they don't get the wrong idea.

226
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,860
I won't be wearing any makeup

227
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:21,740
because I'm allergic to cosmetics.

228
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,320
My gosh.

229
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:25,410
All right, fine.

230
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:29,080
Jeez, I'm famished.

231
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,500
Mom, this place serves grilled mackerel.

232
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:36,000
It smells incredible.
Let's eat here, okay?

233
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:39,630
Come on, let's eat. It smells delicious.

234
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:40,880
TODAY'S MENU: GRILLED MACKEREL

235
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,220
It's the oil that
makes a grilled mackerel perfect.

236
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,590
The taste of grilled fish
and the crunchy skin.

237
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:51,180
Mom, here you go. All right.

238
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,980
MYSTIC POP-UP BAR

239
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,600
Moist and strongly seasoned.

240
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,190
It really is delicious.

241
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:02,150
Kang-bae, why haven't you told us that
you work at a bar with delicious food?

242
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:06,110
It's my first day today.
It could just be a temporary job.

243
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:09,120
Then we should come by often.

244
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,540
It's even better than grilled beef.

245
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:17,750
I've always been known
for my grilled mackerel.

246
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:21,340
It's not as good as
what my mom makes though.

247
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,880
Eun-su, don't be rude.

248
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,470
You have way more experience
cooking mackerels.

249
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:31,260
She raised me by herself
while running a grilled fish restaurant.

250
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:33,140
Isn't she incredible?

251
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:36,270
Don't praise me
for something everyone does.

252
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,940
She's right, you know.
It truly is admirable.

253
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,020
Right?

254
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,320
Hi, honey.

255
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,030
That was today, wasn't it?

256
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,490
Gosh, I totally forgot.
I'm with my mom right now.

257
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,620
Sorry. I'll be right there.

258
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,580
Mom, I'm sorry.

259
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:02,420
I forgot that I had dinner plans
with his friends.

260
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,920
How could you let that skip your mind?
You should get going.

261
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:08,550
Make sure you stay and finish this, okay?

262
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:11,350
Kang-bae, look after my mom for me.

263
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:13,470
Sure thing. Don't worry. See you around.

264
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:16,850
Your daughter seems like the sweetest.

265
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:19,730
There's no doubt
you did a good job raising her.

266
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:23,480
You're wrong.

267
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:28,030
I have never been a good mother.

268
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,240
Can I have some water?

269
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:40,000
Water?

270
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,670
Here you go.

271
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:52,390
MYSTIC POP-UP BAR

272
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,770
This is a plate for the bones.

273
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:12,910
Who told you to serve water
and give out empty plates?

274
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,080
You're supposed to touch
the person I choose

275
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,580
and make them tell their story.

276
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:17,660
What?

277
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:19,250
Ms. Andong?

278
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:21,620
Of course.
Do we have another customer here?

279
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,960
Now go over to her. Come on!

280
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,090
Get going.

281
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,930
So how much is everything?

282
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:36,220
I'd better get going.

283
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:39,100
Ms. Andong, please stay a little longer.

284
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:46,980
Sure.

285
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:48,980
Why not?

286
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:57,780
I have wronged my dear Eun-su.

287
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,540
You wronged her?

288
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:04,960
I'm not even sure where I should begin.

289
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:15,640
<i>I became a widow at a young age</i>

290
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:19,140
<i>and opened a grilled mackerel diner
to make a living.</i>

291
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:22,890
<i>A young woman by the name of Lee Sun-hwa</i>

292
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:25,230
<i>helped me out.</i>

293
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,900
<i>She was an orphan and quite lonely too.</i>

294
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:32,110
<i>That's how we bonded so quickly.</i>

295
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,490
ANDONG BAR

296
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:38,870
Why haven't you married yet?

297
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,160
Have you even had a boyfriend?

298
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:46,630
I'm too shy, you see.

299
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,050
I've been moving from place to place
working as a housekeeper, so no.

300
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:54,760
You can't die a virgin though.

301
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:58,010
What if

302
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,220
I got married and gave birth to a child

303
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:06,940
only to let it become an orphan like me?

304
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:10,900
Gosh. Why would you say such harsh things?

305
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:15,200
If that happens by any chance,
I'll take care of the kid for you.

306
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,610
So just find someone already.

307
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,990
Your only worry should be
about snagging the right guy.

308
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:22,200
I got married once,
but I wouldn't mind doing it again.

309
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:25,080
You should go for it.

310
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:27,620
<i>Then a guy entered the diner.</i>

311
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:29,250
We're closed...

312
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:53,860
<i>I fell for the guy hard.</i>

313
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,280
<i>He was tall, handsome,</i>

314
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,660
<i>kind, and sincere.</i>

315
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:01,450
<i>I wanted to make him mine.</i>

316
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,290
Is Sun-hwa not here today?

317
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:06,370
Yes, she went to the sauna.

318
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:08,500
I see.

319
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:15,130
It must be exhausting
to drive the truck around the country.

320
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:18,800
Mr. Ko, go ahead and have some.

321
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:20,720
But I didn't order any oysters.

322
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,680
Dig in.

323
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,850
I hear that oysters are good for men.

324
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:28,390
<i>Whenever he was in town,</i>

325
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,520
-<i>he came by my diner.</i>
-I'll eat it myself.

326
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:34,190
-No, let me.
-<i>I thought he had feelings</i>

327
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,360
<i>for me too.</i>

328
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,950
-<i>Boy, was I wrong.</i>
-How fascinating.

329
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,740
You've been bragging
about that new camera of yours,

330
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,410
so make us look good, okay?

331
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,960
All right then.

332
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:51,630
There we go.

333
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,380
Make sure you develop one for each of us.

334
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,800
Sure thing. I'll take the photo then.

335
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,380
In one, two, three.

336
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,430
-Thank you for doing this.
-Don't mention it.

337
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,600
We have something to tell you.

338
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,140
What? We?

339
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,150
Sun-hwa is with child.

340
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,280
It's been three months.

341
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,530
We're planning to get married soon.

342
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:24,280
No wonder Sun-hwa has been
rejecting all the men around here.

343
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:26,830
She was already taken!

344
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:28,950
-Congratulations.
-Thanks.

345
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,910
There you go.

346
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,210
-<i>My blood boiled.</i>
-All right.

347
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:35,210
-Bottoms up.
-<i>I couldn't keep a straight face.</i>

348
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:36,420
<i>Congratulations.</i>

349
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:40,300
<i>So I applied layers of makeup
to mask my expression.</i>

350
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,930
<i>Darker, thicker, and more colorful.</i>

351
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,560
<i>It was as if I was mad.</i>

352
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,480
<i>Sun-hwa gave birth to a girl,</i>

353
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,230
<i>but I never visited.</i>

354
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:57,650
<i>I hated her guts for stealing my man,
so how could I?</i>

355
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:00,780
Is that so? There, there.

356
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,450
<i>It was a disgusting act of jealously.</i>

357
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,370
Damn.

358
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,590
Good evening.

359
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:23,380
Goodness, it's you, honey.

360
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:25,680
Or should I say Baby Daddy?

361
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,970
Congratulations.

362
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:31,430
I stopped by to show my gratitude.

363
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:35,730
Thank you for taking
good care of my Sun-hwa.

364
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:37,400
Your Sun-hwa?

365
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,650
Your Sun-hwa?

366
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:45,570
Look here, Mr. Ko.

367
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:50,120
I'm glad that you two
are in love and all, but...

368
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,170
Should I tell you this?

369
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:59,130
No, I shouldn't.

370
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:01,170
Did something happen to Sun-hwa?

371
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,260
Your problem is that you're too naive.

372
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,800
Come on.

373
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:14,180
Do you really believe
that you're the father of the baby?

374
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:17,520
-What?
-You two had a long distance relationship.

375
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:20,940
You don't even know
anything about her past.

376
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,440
Well,

377
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,450
how could you know

378
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,320
when that minx never told you?

379
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:30,080
What do you mean by that?

380
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,000
I'm only telling you this
because you're like a brother,

381
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:38,040
so take what I tell you to heart.

382
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,290
What happened is that...

383
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:56,020
Honey, that's not true.

384
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,890
Rumors don't come out of nowhere.

385
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,600
That's ridiculous!

386
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:01,150
Honey, please...

387
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:04,360
Damn it.

388
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,700
You crazy bitch.

389
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:10,370
What did my drunk brain yap about?

390
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,700
I need to go over there
and tell him that I lied.

391
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:24,250
Honey!

392
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:26,920
Dong-gil!

393
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:29,010
-Sun-hwa...
-Dong-gil!

394
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:30,470
-Sun-hwa...
-Honey!

395
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,550
<i>The door to hell opened there and then.</i>

396
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:14,300
<i>The baby only had me to take care of her,</i>

397
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,770
<i>so I had to raise her
even though I wanted to die myself.</i>

398
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,900
<i>As Eun-su grew up,
she resembled her mother more and more.</i>

399
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,730
<i>The amount of guilt it brought</i>

400
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,570
was truly too much to bear.

401
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,660
What I said while intoxicated

402
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:38,790
put me in Hell forever.

403
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:41,920
My dying wish

404
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:47,300
is to have Eun-su meet her birth father,

405
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,420
but I've had no luck finding him.

406
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:55,760
It's frustrating
because this lung cancer I have

407
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:57,810
will take my life soon.

408
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,270
Cancer?

409
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,310
Don't tell Eun-su.

410
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:04,600
My poor daughter

411
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:08,320
shouldn't have
the best day of her life ruined.

412
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,240
Unbelievable.

413
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,530
Think about it.

414
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:19,660
That girl has been calling her mom
all this time,

415
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:22,290
not knowing what she had done.

416
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,380
You're a fraud. Your daughter...

417
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:29,090
Actually, she's not even your daughter.

418
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,670
Aren't you sorry for what you did?

419
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:42,230
Gosh, what on earth did I say?

420
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:44,600
Get out.

421
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:48,110
I refuse to serve drinks
to a murderer like you.

422
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:49,980
Ms. Weol-ju, how can you say that?

423
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:51,990
She's not a murderer.

424
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:56,030
Swords and guns are not
the only weapons that can kill.

425
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:57,990
You?

426
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:00,990
It was your tongue that killed her

427
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,290
and destroyed a family.

428
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:07,040
She probably serviced
the Crown Prince well every night.

429
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:09,960
I think she's on a path
to becoming his concubine.

430
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,840
I knew it. Those born of lowly status

431
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,170
only know how to sell their bodies.

432
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:17,140
And all you do

433
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,350
is apologize?

434
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:23,520
Do you think you can avoid going to hell
if she forgives you?

435
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,270
That won't happen.

436
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:29,360
You should carry your sins with you
until you die

437
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:32,190
and be judged at the gates of hell.

438
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:36,360
I think that's enough.

439
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,240
Please.

440
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,040
I'm sorry.

441
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,380
I shouldn't have said that.

442
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,920
I'll be going now.

443
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:56,800
Ms. Andong.

444
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,050
Ms. Andong.

445
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:08,190
Don't you think you were being too harsh?

446
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:11,860
She's dying. Shouldn't we try to help her?

447
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:15,070
Just because she's dying doesn't mean
we should go easy on her.

448
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:17,450
Why did you even want me to work here?

449
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:20,320
You said we'll help people
and grant their wishes.

450
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:23,120
You never said we'll be scolding them
and kicking them out!

451
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,250
Are you going to take responsibility
if she collapses from shock?

452
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,630
"Take responsibility"?

453
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:35,670
She's the one
who should take responsibility.

454
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,930
You reap what you sow, got it?

455
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:12,350
What are you doing?
Why did you skip lunch?

456
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,600
Are you tired?

457
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,440
Is it because you have
that side job at night?

458
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:22,020
I'm quitting that job for good today.

459
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,440
Why? You said you had
the perfect body for it.

460
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:29,110
There's nothing I can do alone.

461
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,070
I need that drink.

462
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:34,370
That's right.

463
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,040
With that drink...

464
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:42,920
I guess Special Case isn't coming back.

465
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:44,590
We don't need that idiot.

466
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:46,340
Are you sure?

467
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:50,180
I can manage alone.

468
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:53,640
Welcome.

469
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,480
A bottle of soju, please.

470
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:01,560
-Soju?
-Anything else?

471
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:06,530
That jerk. I'm going to grill him alive.

472
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:11,110
That's it. Let it all out
and it will make your drink taste better.

473
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:18,950
He fooled me.

474
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,710
Apparently, he's married.

475
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:25,380
His wife showed up at work today.

476
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:27,250
She pulled out my hair

477
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:30,720
and accused me of being a homewrecker.

478
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,930
Okay, got it.

479
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,850
Let me pour you one.

480
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:36,970
That jerk.

481
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:40,270
Let's teach him a lesson.

482
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:41,940
I loved him.

483
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:46,610
I loved him with all my heart!

484
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:52,400
I get it, but try not to spill the drink.

485
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,570
No, you shouldn't...

486
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:05,670
Oh, my.

487
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:09,380
You sure managed yourself just fine.

488
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:10,970
Well...

489
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:12,720
It was a bad case.

490
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,970
Whatever.

491
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:15,970
MYSTIC POP-UP BAR

492
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:22,850
-Darn it.
-Gosh, she's heavy.

493
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:24,520
Why did she drink so much?

494
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,400
-Put me down!
-What's with her?

495
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,020
-Hey!
-Fine, I get it.

496
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:29,400
Pull yourself together. Hey!

497
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:31,190
My goodness.

498
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:19,620
If I drink this,
I can enter people's dreams.

499
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:30,250
Ms. Andong.

500
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,470
Ms. Andong, wake up!

501
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:39,390
Cancer?

502
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:43,680
You have cancer?

503
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:48,900
Why didn't you tell me?

504
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:54,190
Why did you suffer alone?

505
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:10,080
Hey, Special Case.
By any chance, did you...

506
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:14,130
Why did you do that?

507
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:18,130
You are never to use that drink
no matter what.

508
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:21,390
Understood?

509
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:24,260
Don't drink and don't touch it, okay?

510
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:25,850
That brat.

511
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:28,600
Hey! Where are you?

512
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:49,620
I'm sorry.

513
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,800
Gosh, this is bad.

514
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,140
Eun-su!

515
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:06,180
Eun-su!

516
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:13,440
What? Where am I?

517
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,610
Gosh.

518
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:29,120
Gosh, I'm scared.

519
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:31,620
Hello? Anybody here?

520
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:42,630
I knew this would happen.

521
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:53,270
Mom, I'm so scared.

522
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:00,940
Is anybody there?

523
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:02,820
Excuse me! Help!

524
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:05,870
You fool.
Why didn't you turn on the light?

525
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,910
How dare you steal the <i>ssanggapju</i>?

526
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,920
Ms. Weol-ju.

527
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:17,710
Ms. Weol-ju. You came for me.
I was scared.

528
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:20,170
Why didn't you listen?

529
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:23,300
If you enter the Dream World
before I plan it thoroughly,

530
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:26,640
you could end up trapped
in the person's subconscious forever!

531
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:31,480
So we are in Eun-su's dream?

532
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:35,730
This looks like a movie theater.
Is this also your design?

533
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,230
This is just a basic template.

534
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:40,030
You can see what goes through
the person's mind on the screen.

535
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:43,570
Forget it. I don't know
why I'm telling this to a thief like you.

536
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,030
Oh, the movie is starting.

537
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:52,700
Since we're already here,
let's watch a little bit, shall we?

538
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,920
<i>Eun-su, hang in there.
Mommy is taking you to the hospital.</i>

539
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,840
<i>My baby.</i>

540
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,880
<i>Discipline your kid better, woman.</i>

541
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:07,390
People say she's a spoiled brat
because she has no father.

542
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:11,600
Fine! Then why are your kids such
spoiled brats when they have a father?

543
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:14,890
Stay away from my daughter,
or I'll teach you a lesson!

544
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:17,270
Goodness, what exactly
are you going to do?

545
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:20,650
-I said, stay away from her!
-Break it up!

546
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:24,360
What are you talking about?

547
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,110
No way.

548
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:28,490
My restaurant is still doing pretty well.

549
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:30,280
A high school student shouldn't work.

550
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:34,410
Just focus on your studies, okay?

551
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,460
SAVINGS ACCOUNT

552
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:40,340
Here. Use this money.

553
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:44,130
<i>Get everything you need for your wedding.</i>

554
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:46,010
Ms. Andong

555
00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:48,390
was a real mother.

556
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:51,890
It's the least she should do.

557
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:54,640
Still...

558
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:59,520
What happened?
Is there a fire or something?

559
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,650
Mom!

560
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,370
Doctor! Help!

561
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:12,370
Mom!

562
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,250
Mom!

563
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:17,920
Excuse me.

564
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,540
Please wait outside.

565
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:23,670
Ma'am, can you hear me?

566
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:30,260
Ms. Weol-ju, shouldn't we grant
Ms. Andong's wish before she...

567
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:31,720
Cut it out.

568
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:35,640
Steal my <i>ssanggapju</i> again,
and you're dead meat.

569
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,570
Mom!

570
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,280
Ms. Weol-ju

571
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:54,660
Wait!

572
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:56,620
I'll do it.

573
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,290
I'll sign the contract.

574
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:03,460
Nine people within a month.
I'll sign the contract.

575
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:05,500
So please grant Ms. Andong's wish.

576
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,300
<i>Gosh, what should I do?
He wants to sign the contract?</i>

577
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:12,550
<i>That changes everything.</i>

578
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,140
<i>Should I forget everything and help her?
But that hurts my pride.</i>

579
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:17,980
<i>Wait, who cares about pride
when I'm so close to my 100,000th case?</i>

580
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,060
Ms. Weol-ju?

581
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:24,310
Let's sign it right now.

582
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,610
Well?

583
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,610
Fine, wait here.

584
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:34,530
I'll go get the contract
and <i>ssanggapju</i> from the bar.

585
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:44,000
Look who's here.
I didn't expect to see you here.

586
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:45,590
What are you doing here?

587
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:47,590
Can't you see my uniform?

588
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:50,130
What do you think Death is doing
at the hospital?

589
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:52,880
Let me see.

590
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,510
The name of the deceased is...

591
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:11,570
Mom, no!

592
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:21,080
Mom, don't leave me!

593
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:25,540
There's some time left
until the funeral anyway, right?

594
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:30,090
Everyone says they need just a few days.

595
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:31,970
In the end, I have to chase them.

596
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:34,890
Come on, I'll be with her all the time.

597
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:38,430
Also, Guibanjang at the bar
will make sure she doesn't disappear.

598
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:42,980
If I don't grant her wish, her spirit
will wander the Living Realm forever.

599
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:45,270
Right?

600
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:49,940
I really shouldn't.

601
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:55,990
Why are you glaring at me?
Fine, you can take her.

602
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:58,740
But she has to be back by morning
the day after tomorrow.

603
00:37:58,830 --> 00:37:59,830
Don't be late.

604
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:00,990
Okay.

605
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:02,700
Don't be late.

606
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:09,290
MYSTIC POP-UP BAR

607
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:18,220
-So you're going to look for her father?
-Yes.

608
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:21,640
After you've lashed out at her like that?

609
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,350
I guess you're that desperate, huh?

610
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:25,230
It's not just one case.

611
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:28,940
Nine cases depend on this.
He signed the contract.

612
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,320
You didn't have to.

613
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:39,530
Now that you're dead, let me pour you one.

614
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:54,260
Are you saying
Ms. Andong is here sitting with us?

615
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:55,510
Yes.

616
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:58,260
Is she a ghost now?

617
00:38:58,340 --> 00:38:59,430
That's right.

618
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:09,940
Thank you so much for being nice to me.

619
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:12,150
I'll never forget your kindness.

620
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,160
Rest in peace.

621
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:30,080
My goodness.

622
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,340
I'm the one who should thank you.

623
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:38,510
I know it's shameless of me,

624
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:41,260
but please help me.

625
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:47,640
When I'm gone,
my daughter will be left all alone.

626
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,690
Please tell us everything you know
about Mr. Ko.

627
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:57,320
All I know is that his name is
Ko Dong-gil.

628
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,950
I don't even know
his birthday or hometown.

629
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,240
Oh, wait.

630
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:09,120
It's an old photo of him.
I'm not sure if it'll be of any help.

631
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,630
This is more than enough.

632
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:20,430
What's this?

633
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:21,550
Wait.

634
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,010
Unbelievable. It actually works.

635
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:29,940
Did you get it?
I'm looking for a man called Ko Dong-gil.

636
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:32,980
The photo was taken 30 years ago. Okay.

637
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:35,270
-What is he doing?
-He's tracking down Mr. Ko.

638
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:37,820
The Afterlife Police Agency
has an incredible network.

639
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,650
With a name and a photo,

640
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:41,530
they can find anyone in no time.

641
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:45,120
I might not look it, but I used to be
in the Criminal Department.

642
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:49,500
Mr. Ko has a daughter?

643
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:51,670
Yes. He never told you?

644
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:55,380
Who knows anything about his past?
Not even he does.

645
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,750
What do you mean?

646
00:40:57,340 --> 00:41:00,510
He tried to take his life once.

647
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:04,090
He did survive, but he lost his memory.

648
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:07,180
When he first came here,
all he remembered was his name.

649
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:09,470
He's in that room. Go talk to him.

650
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:11,890
Thank you.

651
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:15,900
He lost his memory?

652
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,520
What should we do?

653
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:18,860
Let's see what we can do.

654
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:21,700
Go get some mackerel first.

655
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:32,160
Oh, my. This is delicious.

656
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:34,420
You're a good cook.

657
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:38,130
But why are you making all this for me?

658
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:39,710
That's not the point.

659
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:43,510
Does the mackerel remind you of anyone,
by any chance?

660
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:47,140
Not really.

661
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:48,720
It should.

662
00:41:48,810 --> 00:41:51,770
A long time ago, you met your wife
at a mackerel restaurant,

663
00:41:51,850 --> 00:41:53,350
do you remember?

664
00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:57,230
I've never been in a relationship
my whole life.

665
00:41:57,310 --> 00:42:01,150
You must be mistaken.

666
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:03,150
We have no choice.

667
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:15,120
Sir, eat slowly.

668
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:27,180
The mackerel

669
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:30,260
does remind me of something

670
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:31,510
-What is it?
-What is it?

671
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:34,270
It was a long time ago.

672
00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:38,560
After that day, I couldn't eat
mackerel for quite a while.

673
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:41,940
While

674
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:44,860
having mackerel,

675
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:49,070
a huge bone got stuck in my throat.

676
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:53,700
I tried eating rice, drinking water,
and all that, but I couldn't get it out.

677
00:42:53,790 --> 00:42:57,290
I thought I was going to die.

678
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,250
Other than that?

679
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:01,000
Other than that?

680
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,090
Nothing.

681
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,680
He doesn't seem to remember anything.

682
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:11,510
What if we get into his dream?

683
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,680
Ms. Andong's funeral is tomorrow.

684
00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:16,730
Before that, we have to take him
to the bar, make him drink <i>ssanggapju</i>,

685
00:43:16,810 --> 00:43:18,810
and refresh his memory.

686
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:21,360
Do you expect him to follow us
all the way to Seoul?

687
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:23,440
I don't think so.

688
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,360
Right.

689
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:31,320
Well, the thing is...

690
00:43:32,370 --> 00:43:35,160
I still have the <i>ssanggapju</i>
I stole yesterday in my bag.

691
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:37,210
I thought Ms. Andong's daughter drank it.

692
00:43:37,290 --> 00:43:40,130
She did, but there's some left.

693
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:43,040
Just a tiny bit. A small glass, maybe?

694
00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:46,130
Bravo!

695
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,340
Were you going to steal that too?

696
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:50,430
I'll let it slide this time.

697
00:43:51,010 --> 00:43:52,430
If you don't, what can you do?

698
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:55,970
Kang-bae, the relationship
between you and Mystic Pop-up Bar

699
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:58,310
can be compared to that of
the red bean paste and a bun

700
00:43:58,390 --> 00:44:01,520
or FC Barcelona and Messi
in terms of soccer.

701
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:04,900
In other words, you're completely equal.

702
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:07,400
You understand?

703
00:44:07,690 --> 00:44:08,530
Sorry?

704
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,530
Cut it out. Let's go inside.

705
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,470
What's the point of living like this?

706
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:49,190
You've lived such a lonely life.

707
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:52,780
Is this his first memory?
Where could his wife and daughter be?

708
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,870
Should we go deeper into his subconcious?

709
00:44:58,450 --> 00:45:00,290
Gosh.

710
00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:01,830
I really

711
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:03,960
didn't want to do that.

712
00:45:23,310 --> 00:45:25,520
Are we in Mr. Ko's subconcious now?

713
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:28,530
We're even deeper than that.

714
00:45:28,730 --> 00:45:30,280
We are beyond his deepest subconscious.

715
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:33,240
We're looking for the memories
that have been locked away by Mr. Ko.

716
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:35,370
Be quiet and focus.

717
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:38,990
-A cockroach!
-Gosh!

718
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:41,500
-Hey!
-Be careful!

719
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:42,910
Stop pushing me!

720
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:44,290
My gosh.

721
00:45:46,670 --> 00:45:48,170
It's okay. Keep going down.

722
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:52,880
How deep is this place anyway?

723
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:55,340
-It's infinite.
-There's no end?

724
00:45:55,550 --> 00:45:56,720
So be careful.

725
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,970
If you lose your footing,
you'll fall into the infinite darkness.

726
00:46:00,430 --> 00:46:03,980
You'll keep falling until your ego
and your soul disappear.

727
00:46:04,270 --> 00:46:06,230
It's like the black hole of the soul.

728
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:08,650
-Let's go.
-Gosh.

729
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:10,110
Keep going down.

730
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:33,130
Gosh, unbelievable.

731
00:46:42,770 --> 00:46:43,980
Come here.

732
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:48,650
You have to enter a password.

733
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:51,900
Why does this have to be so high-tech?

734
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:53,990
I wish we could just knock down the door.

735
00:46:54,070 --> 00:46:55,320
Do you know the password?

736
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:59,660
I don't. Should we try "1111"?

737
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:00,780
"1111"?

738
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:07,370
<i>Authorization failed.</i>

739
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:11,540
-What's going on?
-No!

740
00:47:11,630 --> 00:47:13,500
It's crumbling away!

741
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:15,210
It's collapsing!

742
00:47:18,590 --> 00:47:21,850
How could you be so reckless?
You should use your head.

743
00:47:21,930 --> 00:47:24,930
But we have nothing to go on.
We'll just have to take a wild guess.

744
00:47:25,770 --> 00:47:29,940
At least try to think what's
the most commonly used password.

745
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:31,650
What's that?

746
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:36,900
-<i>Authorization failed.</i>
-No?

747
00:47:37,490 --> 00:47:38,450
What's happening?

748
00:47:38,530 --> 00:47:39,860
-No!
-Gosh.

749
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:43,910
I don't want to die.

750
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,410
<i>You have one more try remaining.</i>

751
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:49,670
-Gosh.
-Hey.

752
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:53,340
What? The "most commonly used password"?
"Use your head"?

753
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:56,590
Hey, stay still. We might fall.

754
00:47:56,670 --> 00:47:59,300
Calm down, Ms. Weol-ju. Please.

755
00:48:05,310 --> 00:48:06,810
Could it be his birthday?

756
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:10,190
It might be in Mr. Ko's profile
from the Intelligence Agency.

757
00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:11,270
Let me see.

758
00:48:11,810 --> 00:48:12,860
Where's my phone?

759
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:14,770
Gosh.

760
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:18,900
I can't move right now.
Can you two look for my phone?

761
00:48:18,990 --> 00:48:19,860
Okay.

762
00:48:19,950 --> 00:48:21,240
Is it in my pocket?

763
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:22,950
I don't think so.

764
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:24,950
Hold on. Not there.

765
00:48:25,330 --> 00:48:27,330
-Where is it?
-Is it there?

766
00:48:27,410 --> 00:48:30,290
This is your phone, right?
I'll take it out.

767
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:32,920
-Please don't touch my armpit.
-Why isn't it coming out?

768
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,920
-Not my armpit!
-Hold on.

769
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,130
Hey!

770
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:49,310
I'm sorry.

771
00:48:50,690 --> 00:48:52,400
I should have stayed still.

772
00:48:52,850 --> 00:48:54,900
But my armpits are extremely ticklish.

773
00:48:56,110 --> 00:48:57,150
Don't worry.

774
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:01,570
I'm sorry I've been so harsh on you.

775
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:04,240
If only I had known
things would end like this.

776
00:49:07,830 --> 00:49:09,290
Goodbye, friend.

777
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:11,370
What?

778
00:49:11,870 --> 00:49:12,750
What do you mean?

779
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:17,590
It's too crowded here.
Shouldn't you go first?

780
00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:20,260
-Hey!
-Wait!

781
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:22,760
Hold on!

782
00:49:23,550 --> 00:49:25,300
You said his birthday, right?

783
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:30,430
Eun-su's wedding is on May 9, right?

784
00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:32,100
Isn't that on her birthday?

785
00:49:32,730 --> 00:49:34,560
I think I might know the password.

786
00:49:37,270 --> 00:49:38,270
Wait!

787
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:40,940
Just a second.

788
00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:42,700
What if it's wrong?

789
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:44,700
This is probably right.

790
00:49:44,910 --> 00:49:47,620
Mr. Ko is a father after all.

791
00:49:48,910 --> 00:49:49,990
Try it.

792
00:49:58,420 --> 00:49:59,590
<i>Access granted.</i>

793
00:49:59,670 --> 00:50:01,710
-It worked!
-Yes!

794
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:04,340
-You did it!
-Hey!

795
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:08,140
You aren't completely useless.

796
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:40,420
As expected,

797
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:43,670
it remained in the depths
of his subconscious.

798
00:50:45,590 --> 00:50:46,470
That's a relief.

799
00:50:47,470 --> 00:50:49,140
Now we have to pull it up.

800
00:51:07,610 --> 00:51:10,070
It's okay. Goodness.

801
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:53,050
That is why

802
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:56,170
it's only now that I'm here.

803
00:51:57,970 --> 00:51:59,010
It's okay.

804
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:02,930
I don't know
what to say to you now though.

805
00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:07,020
After the funeral,

806
00:52:08,730 --> 00:52:11,770
after I pick up the pieces,
I'll get in touch with you.

807
00:52:15,650 --> 00:52:17,610
This is Sun-hwa,

808
00:52:18,110 --> 00:52:20,070
your real mother.

809
00:52:24,290 --> 00:52:25,660
She looks like me.

810
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:29,330
And

811
00:52:30,130 --> 00:52:32,630
this is Ms. Andong when she was young.

812
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:39,800
My mom can't wear makeup
because she has allergies.

813
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:41,850
That must've been

814
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:44,720
an atonement for her.

815
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:47,100
Perhaps

816
00:52:48,350 --> 00:52:52,440
she didn't have the courage
to face her foolish self

817
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:55,230
just like me.

818
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:04,370
Was that why you didn't wear makeup?

819
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:07,080
Was it?

820
00:53:08,830 --> 00:53:12,500
You had been suffering alone
all your life,

821
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:19,800
but I had no idea
and told you not to come to school.

822
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:22,680
I even said you embarrassed me
in front of my friends.

823
00:53:29,770 --> 00:53:32,270
I'm sorry, Mom.

824
00:53:33,650 --> 00:53:36,570
I'm so sorry.

825
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:43,820
Thank you for raising me.

826
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:47,870
I was so happy to be your daughter.

827
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:53,960
I love you, Mom.

828
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:01,760
What am I going to do?

829
00:54:02,590 --> 00:54:05,550
I miss my mom already.

830
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:40,760
Let's go.

831
00:54:42,170 --> 00:54:44,970
Now I have no regrets
even if end up in hell.

832
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:52,910
Ms. Andong.

833
00:55:55,660 --> 00:55:56,670
Sun...

834
00:55:57,670 --> 00:55:58,580
Sun-hwa.

835
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:02,250
Sun-hwa.

836
00:56:03,550 --> 00:56:04,510
I

837
00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:07,720
am sorry.

838
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:14,640
It was all my fault. I'm sorry.

839
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:18,140
It was my fault.

840
00:56:24,610 --> 00:56:26,240
Thank you

841
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:30,160
for doing a great job
raising Eun-su for me.

842
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:33,080
No.

843
00:56:34,950 --> 00:56:37,250
It was my fault.

844
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:41,290
I'm sorry.

845
00:56:49,050 --> 00:56:50,340
It's fine.

846
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:54,180
Don't worry anymore,

847
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:58,020
and rest in peace.

848
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:02,440
Okay?

849
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:29,220
Good shot.

850
00:57:29,970 --> 00:57:32,050
Guibanjang, what brings you here?

851
00:57:32,550 --> 00:57:33,930
I came here to play basketball.

852
00:57:34,010 --> 00:57:35,430
Do you play basketball, too?

853
00:57:39,890 --> 00:57:41,640
There is no reason not to.

854
00:57:44,730 --> 00:57:45,900
Here I go.

855
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:02,710
A three-pointer!

856
00:58:10,510 --> 00:58:12,930
Tell me the truth.
You aren't human, are you?

857
00:58:13,220 --> 00:58:14,930
Are you a shooting machine?

858
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:18,560
You should play in the NBA.
What are you doing here?

859
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:19,680
You know,

860
00:58:19,770 --> 00:58:21,100
if I play, people will chase me

861
00:58:21,770 --> 00:58:23,480
instead of the ball.

862
00:58:29,610 --> 00:58:30,740
You're right.

863
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:34,700
All I know in basketball
is how to shoot the ball.

864
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:36,530
Because that's all I can do alone.

865
00:58:39,790 --> 00:58:41,250
You're here for the contract, right?

866
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:43,410
I was going to go see you anyway.

867
00:58:44,670 --> 00:58:45,670
Won't you regret it?

868
00:58:46,170 --> 00:58:47,750
I'm used to failing

869
00:58:48,670 --> 00:58:50,590
whether it's sports or relationships.

870
00:58:51,590 --> 00:58:53,510
That's why I hesitated to take the offer.

871
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:55,890
The price of failure was too much.

872
00:58:55,970 --> 00:58:59,260
Life is about living with other people.

873
00:58:59,350 --> 00:59:02,100
You can't just practice
shooting alone forever.

874
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:03,640
A real game.

875
00:59:06,230 --> 00:59:08,060
You have to live a real life.

876
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:12,190
A real life?

877
00:59:12,860 --> 00:59:14,780
You did a great job

878
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:17,370
with Ms. Andong today.

879
00:59:18,830 --> 00:59:21,080
You and Ms. Weol-ju did all the work.

880
00:59:21,740 --> 00:59:24,080
We couldn't have started it
if it weren't for you.

881
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:26,290
We were a pretty good team.

882
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:30,420
A team?

883
00:59:32,130 --> 00:59:33,340
-It's mine.
-Pass.

884
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:34,800
Shoot it.

885
00:59:35,220 --> 00:59:36,470
-Nice!
-Yes!

886
00:59:36,550 --> 00:59:37,640
Yes!

887
00:59:38,970 --> 00:59:39,970
Nice!

888
00:59:43,350 --> 00:59:44,480
Okay.

889
00:59:45,730 --> 00:59:46,810
I'll join the game.

890
00:59:48,350 --> 00:59:49,520
The real game.

891
00:59:55,780 --> 00:59:57,200
CONTRACT

892
00:59:59,030 --> 01:00:00,280
MYSTIC POP-UP BAR OWNER WEOL-JU

893

PART-TIME EMPLOYEE HAN KANG-BAE

894

WEOL-JU

895
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:19,260
Here.

896
01:00:19,430 --> 01:00:20,390
You'll keep one each.

897
01:00:20,470 --> 01:00:25,600
Special Case, you are Mystic Pop-up Bar's
official part-time employee as of today.

898
01:00:27,270 --> 01:00:28,850
I'm happy to work with you, Ms. Weol-ju.

899
01:00:30,730 --> 01:00:32,400
-You, too, Guibanjang.
-Okay.

900
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:35,240
Don't you dare steal <i>ssanggapju</i> again.

901
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:39,740
If you do, I'll replay the moments you've
been dumped repeatedly in your dream.

902
01:00:40,620 --> 01:00:43,530
I will never steal it again.

903
01:00:43,620 --> 01:00:45,870
Don't scare the kid.

904
01:00:45,950 --> 01:00:50,080
Aren't we going to throw a welcome party
for the new employee?

905
01:00:50,170 --> 01:00:52,210
MYSTIC POP-UP BAR

906
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:10,850
Here you go.

907
01:01:12,730 --> 01:01:15,530
Gosh, it's beautiful when a professional
pours a drink.

908
01:01:16,610 --> 01:01:17,690
It's her job.

909
01:01:17,780 --> 01:01:19,610
It's nothing. Don't flatter her.

910
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:21,030
What do you mean it's nothing?

911
01:01:21,490 --> 01:01:24,160
This is how you should pour beer.

912
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:26,660
MYSTIC POP-UP BAR

913
01:01:37,130 --> 01:01:38,510
What?

914
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:41,840
We're just getting started.
Are you drunk already?

915
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:45,760
I'm sorry.

916
01:01:48,810 --> 01:01:50,480
You guys work at a pop-up bar,

917
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:53,190
but you can't even handle a drink or two.

918
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:56,570
I've drunk you both under the table.

919
01:01:57,070 --> 01:01:58,480
MYSTIC POP-UP BAR

920
01:01:58,570 --> 01:01:59,440
Ms. Weol-ju.

921
01:02:00,490 --> 01:02:01,740
I have a question.

922
01:02:02,860 --> 01:02:04,820
Why does it have to be 100,000 people?

923
01:02:06,330 --> 01:02:08,410
Isn't that too many?

924
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,040
Do you think so?

925
01:02:16,540 --> 01:02:19,170
Yes, it's way too many.

926
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:21,840
Hundred-thousand people?

927
01:02:22,930 --> 01:02:23,970
How can you handle that?

928
01:02:25,180 --> 01:02:26,550
It's ridiculous.

929
01:02:27,140 --> 01:02:28,640
How is that even possible?

930
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:33,270
It's because

931
01:02:35,900 --> 01:02:37,230
I killed 100,000 people.

932
01:02:41,490 --> 01:02:42,360
What?

933
01:03:05,890 --> 01:03:07,550
Because of your fault,

934
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:09,970
the Sacred Tree
that has been defending the country

935
01:03:10,470 --> 01:03:11,890
suffered bad luck.

936
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:14,060
You're aware of that, aren't you?

937
01:03:14,730 --> 01:03:18,310
That is why I've been stuck
in the Hell of Oil Cauldrons for months.

938
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:21,360
Yes, however,

939
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:25,490
the Hell of Oil Cauldrons alone
is not enough to cleanse you of your sin.

940
01:03:26,950 --> 01:03:30,490
The country that had been relying
on the Sacred Tree waned

941
01:03:30,580 --> 01:03:32,660
and was invaded by a neighboring country.

942
01:03:32,750 --> 01:03:35,580
Hundred-thousand people died in this war.

943
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:39,340
Hundred-thousand!

944
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:46,720
What will you do about that?

945
01:03:49,510 --> 01:03:53,180
Go down to the Living Realm and settle
the grudges of 100,000 people.

946
01:03:54,390 --> 01:03:58,020
Listen to their stories and comfort them.

947
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:01,520
That will be your punishment.

948
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:03,610
No.

949
01:04:03,690 --> 01:04:06,900
I will gladly take any other punishment
apart from that.

950
01:04:07,030 --> 01:04:11,030
What? I did not ask for your opinion.

951
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:13,080
That was an order!

952
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:15,080
I took my life because I hated humans.

953
01:04:15,790 --> 01:04:18,080
Yet you want me to live again for humans.

954
01:04:18,670 --> 01:04:19,960
How can you be so cruel?

955
01:04:20,590 --> 01:04:23,000
If making the Sacred Tree suffer bad luck
is such a great sin,

956
01:04:23,090 --> 01:04:24,960
I'd rather be thrown
into the Hell of Extinction

957
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:27,930
and be ripped to pieces and perish.

958
01:04:31,430 --> 01:04:32,310
Is that so?

959
01:04:32,930 --> 01:04:36,100
The Sacred Tree
isn't your only sin though.

960
01:04:46,190 --> 01:04:47,360
Have a look.

961
01:05:29,570 --> 01:05:32,950
So, will you go to the Hell of Extinction?

962
01:05:33,620 --> 01:05:36,330
I can let you be ripped to pieces

963
01:05:36,490 --> 01:05:38,700
and disappear forever as you wish.

964
01:05:39,830 --> 01:05:40,710
No.

965
01:05:41,290 --> 01:05:43,080
No, Yeomradaewang.

966
01:05:43,830 --> 01:05:45,920
Did you say 100,000 people?

967
01:05:47,670 --> 01:05:48,800
I will do it.

968
01:05:51,630 --> 01:05:52,590
I will

969
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:56,310
receive the punishment.
