Chef Park.

6
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:19,820
Hello.

7
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:56,790
I can breathe now.

8
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:59,690
I'm serious.

9
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:02,190
I think you can read my mind better than my colleagues...

10
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:05,100
that I've been working with for four years.

11
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:06,530
You said getting your mouth ready...

12
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:10,370
with cool beer before drinking soju was the best.

13
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:16,570
Chef Park, I'm going to drink hard liquor today.

14
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,780
Hard liquor?

15
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,580
I guess you had a tough day.

16
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:24,720
Yes. Today was infuriating.

17
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,350
I see.

18
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,230
What's my side dish of the night?

19
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,470
Well,

20
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,670
there's a perfect side dish to have...

21
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,310
on a day when you're infuriated.

22
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:49,230
Here you go.

23
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:52,370
It's fun...

24
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,740
to pick at the shells.

25
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,210
I'll show how it's done.

26
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,850
It's good.

27
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,450
Taurine in the Manila clams...

28
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:40,280
will promote the liver function.

29
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,720
This is the best pairing for hard liquor.

30
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,410
This hits the spot.

31
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:06,240
Did you have dinner?

32
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,850
This is a late dinner.

(Access Pass)

34
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,810
Isn't this really petty?

35
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,840
They put names for people with permanent positions.

36
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,440
It only says "Access Pass" for contract workers...

37
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,680
instead of our names.

38
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,850
It's so petty.

39
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,820
Putting names on the card isn't that hard.

40
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,920
Right?

41
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,120
My gosh. I've been working there for years.

42
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,190
But no one calls me by my name.

43
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,130
What's your name?

44
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:07,440
It's Kim Ah Jin.

45
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:10,040
This is on the house for Director Kim Ah Jin.

46
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:11,510
Please dig in.

47
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,510
This is for your quiet and long career at the TV station.

48
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:24,460
Thank you.

49
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:02,960
This is so good.

50
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:06,330
Hello.

51
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,700
Hi, Chef Park.

52
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,430
You're coming here often.

53
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,670
I ought to, you know.

54
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,870
My goodness.

55
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,570
Soju, please.

56
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,640
Sure.

57
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,940
The glasses are in front of you.

58
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:19,940
Okay.

59
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,010
I wonder what he's serving tonight.

60
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:24,780
I can't wait.

61
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:27,750
Chef Park, we'll look forward to your food tonight.

62
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:29,550
Sure.

- In other cities... - That's so cheap.

65
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,020
- At home... - Seriously.

66
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:00,920
- That guy is unbelievable. - I totally agree.

67
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,850
- Don't be ridiculous. - I'm not lying.

68
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:05,860
There aren't many restaurants.

69
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:08,290
What should I do?

70
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:10,930
- Because I live alone... - You're lying again.

71
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:13,860
- No way. - How could they do that?

72
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,300
Why?

73
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:28,680
Dad!

74
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,450
You're intruding on my territory.

75
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:34,720
Why are you here? I told you not to come.

76
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,350
How could I not? I have the most important job.

77
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:38,760
You're exaggerating.

78
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,290
No, I'm not.

79
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:42,590
It's super important to make sure food is properly seasoned.

80
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:45,030
Not everyone can do this. It's too hard.

81
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:47,900
- I thought this... - You should just...

82
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,030
Gosh, that's way too bland.

83
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:50,630
It needs more salt.

84
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,510
Since I was young...

85
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:56,640
- Dad. - Yes?

86
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,310
- Can you hand me a vest? - Sure.

87
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:11,360
- This is all because of you. - No, it's not.

88
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,490
Wait, Dad.

89
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,560
This is a strong young man's job.

90
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:20,330
I'm still a lot stronger than you are.

91
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:23,430
You want to show off your strength? Is that it?

92
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:24,470
What?

93
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
- You're blushing. - Come on.

94
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:29,740
Is it fun teasing your dad?

95
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:33,240
- Why did you come to my house? - Why did you come to my house?

96
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,240
- Are you here to look for... - Are you here to look for...

97
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:41,490
Dad.

98
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:49,190
Try them on.

99
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:52,030
Why did you buy them?

100
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,700
I don't want you to wear worn-out shoes.

101
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:58,240
You have neither a wife nor a girlfriend...

102
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,900
who buys shoes for you.

103
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,170
Do you?

104
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:05,210
I know a cheapskate like you would never buy a new pair of shoes.

105
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,950
And you always spend all your money on others.

106
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:12,320
So, what can I do? As your son, I have to buy you new shoes.

107
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,090
White shoes get dirty easily.

108
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:17,190
They look great on you.

109
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,520
Try walking in them.

110
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:23,330
Do they fit well?

111
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:24,900
Absolutely.

112
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,700

What's wrong?

Wait, what happened?

No! Please!

121

What's wrong?

Pardon?

124
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,520
Then what should I do?

125
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,790
There's a document I have to submit soon.

126
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,930
Actually, permanent employees recently got new computers.

127
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:30,030
You might find some used computers in storage.

128

I packed some food for you.

Don't skip meals.

133
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:06,400
You should eat well too.

134

Just because you're young, doesn't mean you don't get sick.

Dad.

136

I'll pay for half of it.

Come on. Just take a look.

139

This car is still perfectly fine.

140
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:29,820
We bought it when Mom was alive. It's at least 20 years old.

141

But it still works well.

00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,340
What if it breaks down on the road or something?

148
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,340
Hey.

149
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:51,010
Why would you worry about such a thing?

150
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,510
Fine, I get it.

Why do they have to discriminate against contract employees?

00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:38,290
If they had bought me a new computer too,

163
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:41,330
I would have been so touched and worked even harder. Idiots.

00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:14,420
He specifically said that you should do it.

173
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:18,130
I'm just delivering his message.

174
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:23,530
What's that?

175
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,670
"Sweet Munches"?

176
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:29,240
You're submitting a proposal too?

177
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,610
Can't I?

178
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,180
Can contract employees...

179
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:37,280
submit proposals?

180
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,150
I thought they couldn't.

181
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,950
What about you?

182
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,590
You didn't prepare anything because you're a permanent employee?

183
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,860
Or...

184
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,030
is it because you have no ideas to propose anyway?

185
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,460
I mean...

If you have time to do this, just focus on your basic duties.

Okay?

191
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:23,790
Here.

192
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,600
What are you waiting for?

193
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:33,800
A hot Americano with an extra shot.

194
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:44,820
The cup has to be washed first.

195
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,620
Bring the coffee to my desk.

196
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,590
Answer me.

197
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,460
Yes.

Hello, Ms. Kim.

206
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,290
I'd like to submit a proposal.

207
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:56,850
Sure, give it to me.

"Sweet Munchies".

209
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:04,660
I like the title.

210
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,830
- Really? - Yes.

211
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:13,140
Good job. Let's have some meat at the team dinner tomorrow.

212
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:16,240
Is there a team dinner tomorrow?

213
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,440
No one told you?

214
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:23,250
Oh, it must have slipped my mind.

215
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,720
7pm, the pork place.

216
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,290
The pork place.

217
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:31,050
Gosh, is it pork again?

218
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:35,090
Can we go for beef instead?

219
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:39,000
Why is the Variety Show Team so obsessed with pork?

220
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:41,500
Did you pull another all-nighter?

221
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,500
No. I just came.

222
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:46,600
I really like the water pressure here.

223
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,570
I feel a lot better now.

Yes, sir.

You must've been busy. You weren't answering your phone.

why is it so hard to get a hold of you? You don't even come by.

237
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,220
I'm worried,

238
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:13,690
so give me a call.

Are you still here?

00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:33,570
I just completed my manuscript.

Ah Jin.

247
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:39,510
Do you want to get a drink?

248
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:41,780
That sounds good.

249
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:44,850
Should we go to the place you're a regular at?

250
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:47,550
Not there.

251
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,920
Why not? It's time for them to open.

252
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:53,990
It's a place I want to keep to myself.

Why?

255
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,600
Is the chef hot?

256
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,100
Is he my type?

I didn't have many customers today.

263
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:31,460
Gosh. I was hoping to get one more glass of beer.

264
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,300
Just one glass.

265
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:37,170
Right.

266
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:49,050
It's nice to be a regular.

I do too.

Really?

274
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:22,750
You're buried under work...

275
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,180
and I imagine it must be tough,

276
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,620
but you're always bright and strong.

No.

283

I think you were drunk that night.

No, I'm not.

No.

- How could this... - How could this...

299
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:10,190
I hope we get along.

Are you not coming

310
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:08,810

00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,960
What's this?

315
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,580
Hi, Dad.

316
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:13,280
Yes, Park Hyung Soo is my dad.

317
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,680
Who is this?

318
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,940
There was bleeding in the endocranium...

319
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,910
and we had to urgently perform surgery.

320
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:42,710
Luckily, the bleeding has stopped...

321
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:45,150
and we haven't seen any additional bleeding yet.

322
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,840
- There you go. - It's mine!

323
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:16,680
Wait, my father didn't have car insurance?

324
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:19,680
"Liability insurance"? What's that?

325
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:24,650
Does it mean he won't get compensated for the damage?

- Hello. - Are you here to take out a loan?

338
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:53,380
Well, I wanted to find out how much I can take out for a loan.

339
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:56,950
- Can you give me your ID? - Okay.

340

341

You have a student loan.

00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:14,800
Do you have any collateral? What about the lease for Bistro?

343
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:18,800
Well, I didn't sign the lease under my name.

344
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:21,540
Then,

345
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:24,910
how about your house? Do you own it? Or is it a deposit-based house?

346
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:26,880
I pay monthly rent.

347
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,910
How much is the deposit?

348
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:31,810
5,000 dollars.

349
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:38,820
But I've been using this bank for several years now.

350
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,690
Can you take my record into consideration for the loan?

351
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:48,560
How much do you need?

352
00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:50,430
Well,

353
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:53,200
how much can I borrow?

354
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:09,150
We cannot...

355
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:11,350
give out any loan for you.

356
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,800
In Deok, why didn't you answer my calls?

357
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,110
Where are you? You're not at the restaurant.

358
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:31,310
Are you there?

359
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:44,250
In Deok.

360
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,760
Hey, you're here.

361
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:49,360
I couldn't reach you for days. Where have you been?

362
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,190
Sit down.

363
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,570
By the way, what's going on?

364
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:01,540
I'm pulling out from this place.

365
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:06,440
What are you talking about? Why would you do that?

366
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:08,980
It just happened.

367
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,750
Wait. But you didn't even tell me anything about that.

368
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,260
How could you tell me...

369
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:23,830
such an important decision on the day you're moving out?

370
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,660
- I'm sorry. - In Deok.

371
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,870
Why are you doing this?

372
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:33,340
I need this place.

373
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:36,470
My father was in a car accident, so he had emergency surgery.

374
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:37,470
What?

375
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,210
Is he okay?

376
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,950
The surgery went well,

377
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,520
but In Deok,

378
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:49,020
can you reconsider?

379
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:53,720
I don't have any assets. Where could I get a job?

380
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:56,190
You know that all I can do is cook.

381
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,090
Jin Sung.

382
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,360
I'm really sorry.

383
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:05,030
I know things are tough for you more than anyone.

384
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:08,440
I'm in a tight spot too.

385
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:33,760
(The link between you and me)

386
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:37,730
(Hideout)

387
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,530
(Immediate cash loans are available.)

388
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,170
- My gosh. - Come on.

389
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:13,440
- Hold on. Give me that. - Let me do that.

390
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,140
- Okay. - This looks great.

391
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:19,180
- Let me pour you a drink. - Right.

392
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:21,110
- This is good. - Exactly.

393
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:22,810
- Look at your shirt. - My gosh.

394
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:24,850
- Hey, drink up. - Okay.

395
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:26,380
- What is it? - Yes.

396
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:32,590
Now that we've had some food,

397
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:35,420
let's talk about our jobs.

398
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:40,300
How can you eat meat right now?

399
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:42,430
Did it taste good?

400
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,700
When I read the proposals you guys submitted,

401
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,670
the thought of other people reading them...

402
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:49,770
embarrassed me.

403
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:52,410
So I put them in the paper shredder and destroyed them.

404
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,280
That's how awful they were.

405
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:00,720
Ah Jin.

406
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,150
Yes?

407
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:07,920
"A Gay Chef's Sweet Munchies"?

408
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:10,890
Do you know how many cooking shows...

409
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:13,430
the other TV stations have?

410
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:18,670
Eight.

411
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:21,370
Our industry is saturated with cooking shows.

412
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:23,570
You want to run another cooking show?

413
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:26,110
Don't you think about the viewers?

414
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:29,980
But this isn't just a regular cooking show.

415
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:32,680
The gay chef will give them advice.

416
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,680
Why?

417
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:37,590
Do you think this will get high ratings...

418
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:40,590
because the presence of a gay chef will be shocking?

419
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:44,530
Did you think about...

420
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:47,560
how these gay chefs will be perceived by the viewers?

421
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:50,400
You need a clear agenda for a program like this.

422
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:52,800
If you're not careful with this subject,

423
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,500
you'll end up getting criticized by everyone.

424
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:57,310
Do you get it?

425
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,310
Okay.

426
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:06,680
My goodness. I'm sorry I'm late. I had a meeting.

427
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,750
- Hello. - Hello.

428
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:13,020
As always, the seat in front of you is empty.

429
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:18,990
- Next, No Jae Soo. - Yes?

430
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:21,100
Why is that shocking?

431
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:25,670
Besides, should we pretend they don't exist...

432
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:28,770
because we're scared to be criticized by people?

433
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:37,880
What?

434
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,180
Ah Jin, what's wrong with you?

435
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:41,320
You know what?

436
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:44,250
I've given a lot of thoughts and time into this proposal.

437
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:46,520
I didn't treat this subject lightly.

438
00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:48,990
Go on.

439
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:53,900
The thing about people is...

440
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:57,000
when they don't know someone,

441
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,170
they consider that person to be a different species.

442
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:02,140
And they'd be uncomfortable and scared to talk to them.

443
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:06,210
I want to show the viewers that the way they live...

444
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:08,710
and all the feelings they have are identical to...

445
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:13,180
our way of life and our feelings. I want to show they're just like us.

446
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:53,220
Only 4,000 dollars?

447
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,790
Can't I borrow any more than that?

448
00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:00,500
No one would lend you more without security.

449
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:03,200
What's the interest rate?

450
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,680
47 percent?

451
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:17,250
Give me a chance.

452
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:19,420
If you do,

453
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,750
I'm confident I can do a good job.

454
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:32,930
I guess CK didn't recognize our future star director.

455
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:40,300
They haven't even given you permanent employment yet?

456
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,840
All right.

457
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,570
I'll give you a chance.

458
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:51,280
Really?

459
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:53,480
But only on one condition.

460
00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:55,750
Your chance lasts only for a day.

461
00:38:56,550 --> 00:39:01,090
Bring a gay chef who meets my standards within 24 hours.

462
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:07,230
How could I do that within a day?

463
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:09,160
Let's say a live show guest has an accident...

464
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,370
and doesn't show up.

465
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:13,000
Would you say you don't have enough time to find a replacement...

466
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,340
and not air the show?

467
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:18,040
As a director, you should be able to find the people you need...

468
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,510
within the time limit.

469
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,480
What?

470
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,110
I just gave you a chance, and you want to give up?

471
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:26,450
No.

472
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:28,450
I can do it.

473
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:30,920
Really? That's great.

474
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:32,960
But one more thing.

475
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:37,390
What if you fail?

476
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:41,830
Pardon?

477
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:45,030
If you fail to bring the right person,

478
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:49,200
you'll lose not only the show...

479
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:54,280
but also your position...

480
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,880
at CK Channel.

481
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:13,700
Okay.

482
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:15,500
It's a deal.

483
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:19,030
All right.

484
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:29,010
I must be out of my mind.

485
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:39,220
Hey.

486
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:42,490
Ah Jin.

487
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:44,260
You surprised me.

488
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:49,170
How could you say those things in front of someone so high up?

489
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:52,070
Is it because you're a temporary employee?

490
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:54,740
Because you're not going to work with her for a long time anyway?

491
00:40:55,970 --> 00:40:56,970
Mr. Nam.

492
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,150
- Mr. Nam, we're leaving. - Okay, let's go.

493
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:03,320
Hey, come to your senses.

494
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:05,760
You can't say whatever you want to say.

495
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,760
You completely ruined our team dinner.

496
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,130
Unbelievable.

497
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,860
Do you not understand the hierarchy?

498
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:19,090
Let's go. Gosh.

499
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:35,950
- See you. - See you.

500
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:39,050
Why did this guy drink so much? Hey.

501
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:41,150
- Come on. - I'll take him home.

502
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:42,900
- Come here. - Mr. Lee!

503
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,320
Good night!

504
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:46,590
They all left.

505
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:48,920
But I can have another drink with you.

506
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:50,760
Forget it, that's what you want.

507
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:51,760
Hey.

508
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:54,740
Do you think you can brag because you have a company card?

509
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:57,300
Gosh, there you go again.

510
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,610
Hey, let's have another drink!

511
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:01,380
Please!

512
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:08,320
You eat so much.

513
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,690
How can you eat all that?

514
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:13,690
You'll understand if you live alone.

515
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:15,720
Oh, you do live alone.

516
00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:19,900
By the way, why did you give Ah Jin a chance?

517
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:21,420
Were you convinced by her words?

518
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:25,440
M Channel is already airing American reality shows.

519
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:26,630
I know.

520
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:28,400
But they're being criticized a lot.

521
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:30,840
They still get high viewer ratings.

522
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:33,150
People love watching the shows they hate.

523
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:36,510
That's what being in a high position does to you.

524
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:38,820
Viewer ratings come before anything, right?

525
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,090
Anyway, if you were going to give her a chance,

526
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:43,880
why couldn't you give her more time?

527
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,760
Why do you have to torture her like this?

528
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:47,530
Because I want to.

529
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:49,900
Of course, because you want to.

530
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,220
Did you read my proposal?

531
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:55,900
Everything was garbage, including yours.

532
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:59,030
Hey! Please support me.

533
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:00,800
Why do you keep saying that?

534
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,070
Why would I support you?

535
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:04,380

Are you okay?

539
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:37,300
Isn't...

540
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:39,840
this hospital expensive?

541
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:44,070
Dad, you almost died in an accident.

542
00:44:44,570 --> 00:44:46,380
And you worry about your hospital bills?

543
00:44:47,950 --> 00:44:50,070
I don't think this is covered by my insurance.

544
00:44:50,150 --> 00:44:51,420
So why...

545
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:00,030
Don't worry. It's not that expensive.

546
00:45:02,090 --> 00:45:03,950
Don't worry about a thing.

547
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:05,900
All you have to do is recover.

548
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:10,260
But you don't have any money.

549
00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:13,340
If you're so worried about money,

550
00:45:14,110 --> 00:45:15,900
you'd better get well quickly.

551
00:45:26,110 --> 00:45:27,740
I'm sorry.

552
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:31,510
Why would you say that?

553
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:41,760
You know how mean she can be.

554
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:44,170
Why did you have to go against her?

555
00:45:44,170 --> 00:45:46,090
Then should I have remained quiet?

556
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:50,530
"I apologize for coming up with..."

557
00:45:50,530 --> 00:45:52,700
"and proposing such an absurd idea."

558
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:55,400
"I'm such an incompetent person."

559
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:56,880

00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:11,920
I doubt there are many chefs who came out as gay.

566
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:15,260
Also, it has to be someone competent, right?

567
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:17,630
You started this.

568
00:46:17,630 --> 00:46:19,240
Why are you dragging me into this?

569

Help me, please.

570

Does it pay 10,000 dollars?

678
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:02,920
I asked who you are.

679
00:55:09,470 --> 00:55:12,470
Please help me out.

680
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:15,610
Who are you and why are you doing this?

681
00:55:15,630 --> 00:55:16,740
Get up.

682
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:19,300
I used to work for In Deok.

683
00:55:19,570 --> 00:55:21,570
You can't sell this to anyone else.

684
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:24,720
I worked on every corner of this place.

685
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,840
This place means everything to me.

686
00:55:27,450 --> 00:55:31,220
If you give me some time, I'll come up with the deposit.

687
00:55:31,510 --> 00:55:32,990
Please.

688
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:50,510
You must have had at least 15 chefs so far.

689
00:55:50,510 --> 00:55:51,530
Right?

690
00:55:52,130 --> 00:55:55,380
Did not a single person show up?

691
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:00,840
Look.

692
00:56:01,110 --> 00:56:03,050
I gave it some thought.

693
00:56:03,150 --> 00:56:06,780
I'll clean out your desk for you.

694
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:08,820
What do you think?

695
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:15,260
Have a nice day.

696
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:19,530
- Gosh. - It's cold here.

697
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:20,940
It's cold.

698
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:28,300
I can't just sit here. I'll go out and look for someone.

699
00:56:28,470 --> 00:56:29,900
Go where?

700
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:32,510
Then what am I supposed to do? I have to do something.

701
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:36,190
Excuse me.

702
00:56:37,490 --> 00:56:39,590
I'm here for the audition.

703
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:41,860
- Yes. - Yes.

704
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:47,570
- Over here. - Come this way.

705
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:34,780
Wait. Ms. Cha.

706
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:46,650
Why can't I cast him?

707
00:57:46,950 --> 00:57:48,190
What are you doing?

708
00:57:48,190 --> 00:57:50,220
I know that I didn't have a shot, to begin with.

709
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:52,150
But this isn't fair at all.

710
00:57:52,150 --> 00:57:53,450
Do I seem like I have time for this?

711
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:56,530
Do you think I'd do this just to torture you?

712
00:57:57,130 --> 00:57:59,740
Then, why can't I cast him?

713
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:01,530
He wasn't that bad.

714
00:58:01,530 --> 00:58:03,340
Must I tell you why you can't cast him?

715
00:58:05,010 --> 00:58:06,510
His hands are too chubby.

716
00:58:07,570 --> 00:58:08,570
What?

717
00:58:09,510 --> 00:58:10,740
You didn't think about...

718
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:13,880
the close-up shots you'd need when he's cooking, right?

719
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:16,380
He's supposed to win over women's hearts.

720
00:58:16,780 --> 00:58:18,050
Will you use a hand double?

721
00:58:19,150 --> 00:58:20,150
Move.

722
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:38,630
You should beg me to give you...

723
00:58:39,010 --> 00:58:40,130
one more day.

724
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:41,670
Doors are opening.

725
00:58:43,610 --> 00:58:45,670
Ms. Cha, can you give me one more day?

726
00:58:45,670 --> 00:58:47,320
If you need one more day,

727
00:58:47,510 --> 00:58:49,320
it would mean that you're admitting...

728
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:51,360
that your ability to cast and your credibility,

729
00:58:51,690 --> 00:58:54,860
which are important qualifications of being a director, are lacking.

730
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:58,200
You don't...

731
00:59:00,530 --> 00:59:02,090
need to give me more time.

732
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:08,530
You have four hours left.

733
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:10,740
Are you okay?

734
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:13,200
Yes.

735
01:00:43,490 --> 01:00:44,570
Hey.

736
01:01:30,450 --> 01:01:31,670
Chef Park?

737
01:01:32,380 --> 01:01:33,380
What?

738
01:01:46,450 --> 01:01:47,530
Starting now,

739
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:49,990
I am not myself.

740
01:03:06,610 --> 01:03:08,150
I must hide my identity completely.

741
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:18,920
You know what?

742
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:21,380
I can just do this once.

743
01:03:23,780 --> 01:03:25,490
This is the only way I can survive.

744
01:03:47,950 --> 01:03:49,150
Starting now,

745
01:03:50,340 --> 01:03:53,050
I'm a gay chef.

746
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:20,950
(Sweet Munchies)

747
01:04:20,950 --> 01:04:22,490
His looks and his culinary skills.

748
01:04:22,490 --> 01:04:25,150
Isn't he what we've been looking for?

749
01:04:25,150 --> 01:04:28,280
I really want to launch this program with him.

750
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:30,090
Show me what you had in mind.

751
01:04:30,090 --> 01:04:32,490
There's a thin line between fashion and costumes.

752
01:04:32,490 --> 01:04:34,300
If it's too much, you'll look ridiculous.

753
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:36,820
Are you saying that I look ridiculous?

754
01:04:36,820 --> 01:04:38,840
- Is he famous? - He's really popular nowadays.

755
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:41,130
That jerk. I'll meet with him.

756
01:04:41,130 --> 01:04:43,400
Can you help me out just this once?

757
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:44,670
Can I ask you...

758
01:04:44,940 --> 01:04:47,010
why you want to be a gay chef?

759
01:04:47,340 --> 01:04:49,240
Why don't you join me?

760
01:04:49,470 --> 01:04:51,780
Watch me. I'll make a great show.
