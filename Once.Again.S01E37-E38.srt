1
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:10,909
What do you mean?

2
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,609
The woman I like...

3
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:16,050
is going with me to eat dinner.

4
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,220
Hi, Si Hoo.

5
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,330
Okay.

6
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:30,659
Mom will be right back.

7
00:00:31,659 --> 00:00:32,800
Bye.

8
00:00:50,949 --> 00:00:52,120
Yes, sir.

9
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:58,059
Really? Is it urgent?

10
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,659
Okay, got it.

11
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:04,290
I'll be right up.

12
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,059
Sure thing.

13
00:01:08,229 --> 00:01:10,269
That was the administration office.

14
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:11,645
There's an issue with
the contract we signed...

15
00:01:11,669 --> 00:01:13,239
with a pharmaceutical company...

16
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,509
and it needs
to be solved immediately.

17
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:17,610
Can I take a rain check on dinner?

18
00:01:17,769 --> 00:01:19,080
Sure thing.

19
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:20,739
Sorry about this.

20
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:22,780
I'll see you tomorrow.

21
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:41,030
We should go too.

22
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:43,330
Sure.

23
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,149
So that's how
you confess your love to someone.

24
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:07,060
Who knew? I guess I was schooled.

25
00:02:09,459 --> 00:02:11,800
He told her how he feels
all so casually.

26
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,459
It was sophisticated.

27
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:16,100
Right.

28
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,939
Are you all right?

29
00:02:21,769 --> 00:02:23,010
Doesn't it bother you?

30
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,679
Of course not.

31
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,640
Besides, it's none of my business.

32
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:30,249
I knew in advance though.

33
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:33,380
He kept hinting at it.

34
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:35,219
Really?

35
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,689
He's not the patient kind though,
is he?

36
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,600
I thought he'd wait a little longer.

37
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:45,700
Hold on.

38
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:47,806
What's taking the elevator so long?

39
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:49,150
Is something keeping it up there?

40
00:02:53,999 --> 00:02:56,070
Cut! Okay.

41
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:57,969
- Good job, everyone.
- Good job.

42
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,279
Have a good day.

43
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:01,709
- Mr. Song.
- Yes?

44
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:05,119
- That was some great work.
- Gosh, thank you.

45
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,850
I liked your new stuntman.

46
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:09,820
His punches and kicks were sharp...

47
00:03:10,589 --> 00:03:12,695
and his figure
matches his double more.

48
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:15,405
Right? What did I tell you?

49
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:16,565
I said you'd be fond of him.

50
00:03:16,589 --> 00:03:19,029
Where did you find a gem like him?

51
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:21,100
He has a fresh face too.

52
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,875
If he can act,

53
00:03:22,899 --> 00:03:24,875
he might even make it as an actor.

54
00:03:24,899 --> 00:03:27,415
My gosh. He's not on that level yet.

55
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:29,769
Anyway, thank you
for thinking fondly of him.

56
00:03:31,269 --> 00:03:33,140
He'll be here
for the next shoot too, right?

57
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,179
Sorry?

58
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:40,080
Yes, of course. He'll be here.

59
00:03:40,649 --> 00:03:42,219
- Thanks, Mr. Song.
- My pleasure.

60
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:43,565
By the way, what's his name?

61
00:03:43,589 --> 00:03:44,736
His name?

62
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,565
A good person

63
00:03:46,589 --> 00:03:47,760
It's Park Hyo Sin.

64
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,375
You were incredible today.

65
00:03:51,399 --> 00:03:52,676
How can an amateur...

66
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,380
look even sharper than Jeong Bong
who's been at this for five years?

67
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,399
Jong Soo, you're overreacting.

68
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,499
His performance just now...

69
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:03,610
can be done by anyone
who's athletic and nimble.

70
00:04:03,839 --> 00:04:06,209
Well, the landing was great.
I give you that.

71
00:04:06,809 --> 00:04:08,510
The rest seemed sloppy though.

72
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:10,026
As if.

73
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,309
Every move he made was sharp.

74
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,080
Is that so?

75
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:15,550
Let's go then.

76
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:18,589
Sorry about that. My bad.

77
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,790
Jeong Bong.

78
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:25,559
The night air sure is refreshing.

79
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,600
Maybe it's because
I studied hard today.

80
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,970
It could be...

81
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,699
because you're with a decent guy.

82
00:04:35,239 --> 00:04:38,110
But that decent guy
isn't my boyfriend, but my in-law.

83
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:40,780
- How sad is that?
- Seriously?

84
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:43,780
I'm grateful for today though.

85
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:45,850
Na Hee won't have any reason
to hit me today.

86
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,590
You're the best math tutor ever.

87
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:50,590
Didn't I mention that I competed...

88
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:52,619
in the Mathematical Olympiad?

89
00:04:52,989 --> 00:04:54,220
And you proved it.

90
00:04:55,929 --> 00:04:57,235
Hold on a second.

91
00:04:57,259 --> 00:04:59,559
This isn't
the fastest way home for you.

92
00:05:01,129 --> 00:05:04,605
I'm trying to walk more
to lose the weight I put on.

93
00:05:04,629 --> 00:05:06,770
What? That's absurd.

94
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,246
You're still just as slender.

95
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:11,170
As if. You'd be surprised
by the weight I put on.

96
00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:13,379
I really need to work out more.

97
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:18,225
You're not bad at that.

98
00:05:18,249 --> 00:05:19,655
You have good a good stance too.

99
00:05:19,679 --> 00:05:21,526
Left hook, right hook.

100
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,526
- Jab, jab.
- Jab!

101
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,020
- Jab!
- Like this.

102
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:26,460
Light punches.

103
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,889
So my house
is just around the corner.

104
00:05:30,189 --> 00:05:32,535
It's late, so let me walk you
all the way.

105
00:05:32,559 --> 00:05:35,069
That's all right.
It's only a short walk.

106
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,706
You should...

107
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:39,776
head that way over the uphill road.

108
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,410
There's a running track
so you can squeeze a jog in.

109
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:46,079
An uphill road? I see.

110
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:48,186
I'll get going then. Good night.

111
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:49,749
I'll see you tomorrow if I can.

112
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,579
Bye.

113
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,259
If only she stayed longer.

114
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,689
I miss her already.

115
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:01,929
What?

116
00:06:02,189 --> 00:06:04,030
You miss her? Unbelievable.

117
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,960
Are you insane?

118
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:08,900
Well, I miss her.

119
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:13,300
Taxi!

120
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,569
Nice.

121
00:06:30,689 --> 00:06:33,496
Gosh, look at you all
flying across the room.

122
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,795
That's so cool of you.

123
00:06:34,819 --> 00:06:37,566
You don't look like the guys
I see every morning.

124
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:39,535
Joon Seon, is this you?

125
00:06:39,559 --> 00:06:42,499
No, Dad. That's Jong Soo.

126
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:44,706
- This is me!
- I see.

127
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:46,869
Right, it seems like your figure.

128
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,845
- That's right.
- Still,

129
00:06:48,869 --> 00:06:50,446
I think Hyo Sin looked the best.

130
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:51,809
The landing was awesome.

131
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,540
- Thanks.
- Right?

132
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,186
Ji Hun, you have a good eye.

133
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:58,225
It's not easy to land perfectly
without any training.

134
00:06:58,249 --> 00:07:00,150
You could end up busting your knees.

135
00:07:00,619 --> 00:07:02,826
It shows that Hyo Sin
has natural talent.

136
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:04,749
I only copied what I saw on TV.

137
00:07:04,889 --> 00:07:06,660
Yes, that's right.

138
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,465
It only looks good
because he's tall and fit.

139
00:07:09,489 --> 00:07:12,276
You could've
badly injured your knees today!

140
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,730
Don't be ridiculous.
He didn't hesitate at all today.

141
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,006
You did well.

142
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:19,475
I don't know much
about stunt performances,

143
00:07:19,499 --> 00:07:20,970
but you did well for a beginner.

144
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,210
You're nimble and well-coordinated.

145
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:26,139
I guess. You look good.

146
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:33,196
That reminds me. Ga Hee,
didn't you have a job interview?

147
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,220
How did it go?

148
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,449
What?

149
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:38,050
Oh, I'm going to take
a pass on that one.

150
00:07:38,119 --> 00:07:40,460
The gym didn't seem
like my cup of tea.

151
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:43,530
What's the place that
works for you then? Your room?

152
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,960
Dad, must you
kick it where it hurts?

153
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:49,600
Now I know where
Na Hee gets her tendencies from.

154
00:07:50,129 --> 00:07:52,276
- I'm home.
- Hi, Da Hee.

155
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,715
- Welcome home.
- Have some strawberries.

156
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:57,040
Strawberries!
Where's Na Hee? Is she home yet?

157
00:07:57,939 --> 00:08:00,086
- I'm home.
- There she is.

158
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:01,516
- Hi.
- Have some strawberries.

159
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,579
Did you just get home? Me too.

160
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:12,660
Na Hee, I'm ready.
We can begin our session.

161
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,059
I'm sorry,

162
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,160
but can we skip today's session?
I'm tired.

163
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,270
But I solved all the math problems.
Are you that tired?

164
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:27,639
Yes, I'd rather go to bed early.
We'll study tomorrow.

165
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:31,009
Sure. I guess I have no choice.

166
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:46,559
The woman I like
is going with me to eat dinner.

167
00:08:57,469 --> 00:09:00,699
He sure has poor judgement
when it comes to women.

168
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:03,969
"That's what I'm doing."

169
00:09:04,339 --> 00:09:05,585
Are you kidding me with that line?

170
00:09:05,609 --> 00:09:08,240
Could his words be any cheesier?

171
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,996
Who emptied the can? Unbelievable!

172
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,449
Gyu Jin, I'm home.

173
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:18,466
So what if you are?
What am I supposed to do about it?

174
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:21,459
Why are you in a sour mood again?
Is something up?

175
00:09:21,589 --> 00:09:25,400
A sour mood? As if.
I'm in a good mood like always.

176
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,130
Why are you throwing
a temper tantrum?

177
00:09:28,699 --> 00:09:31,569
Living with you
has made me realize...

178
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:34,000
just how temperamental you are.

179
00:09:34,339 --> 00:09:38,439
I seriously suggest
that you seek out a therapist.

180
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,825
A sudden change in one's life
releases cortisol...

181
00:09:42,849 --> 00:09:44,886
which prevents you from
thinking clearly, right?

182
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:49,520
- People these days...
- Seek out a therapist yourself.

183
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:52,366
I hate everything about you,
especially how chatty you are.

184
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:54,890
Actually, I loathe it,
so just shut it and...

185
00:09:55,229 --> 00:09:58,130
Stop kicking me here and there.
It's disgusting!

186
00:09:58,290 --> 00:09:59,400
Let go of me.

187
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:01,846
If you don't,
I'll kick you with my other leg.

188
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:04,075
Why would I let go
when you'll only kick me again?

189
00:10:04,099 --> 00:10:05,370
I'll hold onto them all night.

190
00:10:05,469 --> 00:10:07,540
I dare you to try!

191
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:10,486
- Take that.
- What...

192
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,709
Darn it!

193
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,455
Joon Seon, I was already...

194
00:10:21,479 --> 00:10:24,349
Hyo Sin, have a seat.
Let me put some ice on your knees.

195
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:26,795
Your muscles can go into shock...

196
00:10:26,819 --> 00:10:29,260
if it's not used to being worked
in a certain way.

197
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:30,935
You need to ice them.

198
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,305
But my knees are fine.

199
00:10:32,329 --> 00:10:33,559
Just hold still.

200
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:38,846
How about you tape your knee
before the next shoot?

201
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:39,969
That'd be better.

202
00:10:40,069 --> 00:10:42,370
The next time?
That's never going to happen.

203
00:10:42,439 --> 00:10:45,339
There's no need to
flatly reject the offer.

204
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:48,455
My goal was to only
have you fill in for today,

205
00:10:48,479 --> 00:10:50,555
but you have natural talent.

206
00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:51,949
Why let it go to waste?

207
00:10:52,219 --> 00:10:54,596
Besides, this is
a good opportunity for you.

208
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:58,050
This will give you more of a future
than delivering fried chicken.

209
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:01,520
It's not something I want to do,
so give up on the idea.

210
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:05,729
But Hyo Sin... Hey, wait.
Come back here. Hyo Sin!

211
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,729
He sure is a tough nut to crack.
How do I get him on board?

212
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,500
He clearly isn't fond of the idea.

213
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:16,910
It's not like you can
force people to do things.

214
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,386
I'll work on a speedy recovery.

215
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:22,510
Actually, I've already recovered.
It doesn't hurt anymore.

216
00:11:23,209 --> 00:11:25,425
I'd rather work with you too,

217
00:11:25,449 --> 00:11:27,079
but it's Hyo Sin
that the director wants.

218
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:29,719
How can I persuade him?

219
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,859
Darn it.

220
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,685
A jog early in the morning...

221
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:52,785
sure is different
compared to our training sessions.

222
00:11:52,809 --> 00:11:54,010
How refreshing.

223
00:11:54,609 --> 00:11:56,380
Hyo Sin, wait for me.

224
00:11:57,479 --> 00:12:00,050
Do you mind if we work together?

225
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:01,866
Our faces may not
be shown on the screen,

226
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:05,620
but we can also still become
someone like Chad Stahelski.

227
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:08,835
Do you know the movie
"John Wick" and "Captain America"?

228
00:12:08,859 --> 00:12:10,899
He's the director who
designed the action sequences.

229
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:14,059
Is it because of your day job?

230
00:12:14,229 --> 00:12:16,045
Don't you worry
and let me tell my dad.

231
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:19,370
He may not show it often,
but he's my biggest supporter.

232
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:21,699
Trust me, okay?

233
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:24,609
Hyo Sin, wait!

234
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:27,140
This isn't me falling behind.

235
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:29,650
I'm giving you some space
to rethink my offer.

236
00:12:30,109 --> 00:12:32,620
Come to a wise decision!

237
00:12:33,179 --> 00:12:34,380
Gosh, he's fast.

238
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:37,319
What can I do to persuade him?

239
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,959
Darn, my heart. It's about to burst.

240
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,030
- Darn it.
- My gosh.

241
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:49,530
Wait, are you here
to take a nap too?

242
00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:53,939
I thought I get some shut-eye
before I see my patients.

243
00:12:54,099 --> 00:12:55,140
What about you?

244
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:57,315
I didn't sleep well last night.

245
00:12:57,339 --> 00:12:58,955
Da Hee studied until
late in the night...

246
00:12:58,979 --> 00:13:00,779
and you know I can't sleep
if the light is on.

247
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,079
That's right.

248
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:04,880
Should I leave you to your nap then?

249
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:08,349
It's fine. I don't think
I'm in the mood for one anyway.

250
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,266
Should I leave the room
for you instead?

251
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,420
No, I'm not as sleepy anymore.

252
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,959
Why don't I sit down then?

253
00:13:23,599 --> 00:13:24,599
Lucky you.

254
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:28,810
A man confessed
his feelings for you.

255
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:33,679
Oh, that. Tell me about it.
Who knew that'd happen to me?

256
00:13:33,809 --> 00:13:34,839
Right.

257
00:13:35,579 --> 00:13:37,979
So... What will it be?

258
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:39,780
Will you date him?

259
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:42,050
I don't know.

260
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:45,319
Why? Are you bothered that I might?

261
00:13:45,719 --> 00:13:46,959
Does it make you uncomfortable?

262
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:48,390
What?

263
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:51,229
Why would it bother me?
It's more like this.

264
00:13:52,929 --> 00:13:54,530
Well, Jeong Rok...

265
00:13:55,099 --> 00:13:57,276
is a sweet and considerate guy.

266
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:00,746
But he's quite flirtatious
if you ask me.

267
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:01,986
His eyes are always smiling.

268
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:04,486
He's the type of guy...

269
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,839
that might string women along.

270
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:09,910
It could be annoying to date him.

271
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:14,626
Why the sudden change of heart?
You once wished me luck with him...

272
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:15,930
and said that he's a decent man.

273
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,620
Well, he is. Of course he's decent.

274
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,966
I'm just stating the rumors...

275
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:23,390
and what I have observed
to help you decide.

276
00:14:24,229 --> 00:14:26,035
Sure, I'll consider your advice.

277
00:14:26,059 --> 00:14:27,099
Good.

278
00:14:27,729 --> 00:14:30,630
Anyway, I wish you luck with
your first love. You two seem close.

279
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,370
Me? Wait, with Bo Young?

280
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,569
- You see, Bo Young and I...
- I'll get going.

281
00:14:40,309 --> 00:14:43,325
When will she learn
not to cut people off like this?

282
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:44,709
I doubt she'll ever be able to.

283
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,150
My gosh. Hold on a second.

284
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:52,089
So is she going to date him or not?

285
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:55,020
Unbelievable.

286
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:00,900
Na Hee.

287
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,099
I was on my way to see you.

288
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,905
Is that so?

289
00:15:04,929 --> 00:15:06,800
- Today, for lunch...
- Jeong Rok.

290
00:15:07,469 --> 00:15:10,839
I don't think I'll be able
to join you for lunch today.

291
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:14,356
I was coming over here
to tell you that too.

292
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,380
Something came up.

293
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,150
I see.

294
00:15:17,949 --> 00:15:19,579
Then I'm glad.

295
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:22,650
Your shift begins soon, right?
Have a good one.

296
00:15:32,729 --> 00:15:35,800
What on earth is going on?
Didn't he say he liked me yesterday?

297
00:15:36,829 --> 00:15:38,370
Why is he acting like
nothing happened?

298
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,969
8, 2, 3, cha-cha-cha.

299
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:46,155
2, 3.

300
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:49,209
That's right.
It's not over until it's over.

301
00:15:49,349 --> 00:15:52,256
I, Jang Ok Ja,
have yet to make my move.

302
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,526
Cha-cha-cha.

303
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:56,390
Okay, that'll be all
for today's class. Good job.

304
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:59,035
Can I get your attention
for a second though?

305
00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:00,935
I have an announcement to make.

306
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,366
In two months,
the borough will hold...

307
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:05,599
an amateur dance festival.

308
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:09,729
It's a big event
with many prizes to win.

309
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,445
I thought it'd be a good idea...

310
00:16:14,469 --> 00:16:18,146
for a couple in our class
to enter it.

311
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:20,785
I doubt we're good enough
for a competition.

312
00:16:20,809 --> 00:16:21,880
What about me?

313
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:23,685
It's probably better...

314
00:16:23,709 --> 00:16:27,050
to have our two best dancers
enter it.

315
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:29,390
So Ms. Kang and...

316
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:34,059
the always enthusiastic Mr. Yang.
What do you say?

317
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,589
I'd be honored! I'd love to.

318
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:40,075
And Ms. Kang?

319
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:41,530
I'm not sure.

320
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:46,069
It may not work out since
I'm a better dancer than he is.

321
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,870
I have a store to run too,
so I need to think about it.

322
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:53,510
All right then.
I'll wait for your answer.

323
00:16:53,609 --> 00:16:55,209
Me! Let me enter instead.

324
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:58,250
I want to give it a shot.

325
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:00,219
He's my partner,

326
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:01,880
and we are nearly equal.

327
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:10,266
With you

328
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:12,430
Dr. Yoon, is there something
good going on today?

329
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:14,059
Sure.

330
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,099
I'm having a date.

331
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,500
A date?

332
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:18,545
Gosh.

333
00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:20,339
Are you seeing someone?

334
00:17:20,899 --> 00:17:22,040
Well...

335
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:25,246
It feels like she's mine

336
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:27,809
But she's not quite mine

337
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,010
It's like that.

338
00:17:30,109 --> 00:17:32,550
Oh. 3, 2,

339
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,649
and one. Time's up.

340
00:17:35,649 --> 00:17:37,220
Bye. See you.

341
00:17:39,619 --> 00:17:41,490
I bet he's got a girlfriend.

342
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:43,629
I just lost one more guy.

343
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,980
When did you come?

344
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:03,050
I just got here.

345
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:20,129
Why isn't it here?

346
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:23,470
It doesn't say 64 here.

347
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,530
Why do you think is that?

348
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,899
Because it's wrong.

349
00:18:28,069 --> 00:18:29,309
Let me see.

350
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:33,639
F of x plus y equals...

351
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:38,026
f of x plus xy plus four xy.

352
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,956
Then it's limit from h to 0.

353
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,450
And it's f over h.

354
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:44,990
So the answer is...

355
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,129
What is it?

356
00:18:49,659 --> 00:18:50,859
What's the answer?

357
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:53,129
The answer is...

358
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:55,075
Isn't it Na Hee over there?

359
00:18:55,099 --> 00:18:56,270
Na Hee?

360
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,740
It's not her. I was mistaken.
She looks just like Na Hee.

361
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:02,909
You startled me.

362
00:19:03,139 --> 00:19:05,240
Why would Na Hee be here?

363
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:06,839
All right. Look.

364
00:19:08,639 --> 00:19:11,909
Put these in
and calculate the answer.

365
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:13,180
What is it then?

366
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,919
It's number 2, 80. Okay?

367
00:19:17,349 --> 00:19:19,819
I put in the numbers
the wrong way earlier.

368
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:23,030
So you're an Olympiad
contestant indeed.

369
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,760
This is just nothing.

370
00:19:25,829 --> 00:19:27,936
Do you want me to solve it
using my foot?

371
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,300
You don't have to. I believe you.

372
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,940
All right then. Let's go in.

373
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:34,875
Already?

374
00:19:34,899 --> 00:19:36,446
Do you not have
any other problems to ask?

375
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:37,740
I'm almost finished.

376
00:19:38,069 --> 00:19:40,180
And you have some work to do.

377
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,980
I'm fine.

378
00:19:42,309 --> 00:19:43,555
I excel in memory work,

379
00:19:43,579 --> 00:19:45,349
so I can memorize it all
once I read it.

380
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,050
Still, I don't want
to take up your time.

381
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:49,819
Let's go.

382
00:20:03,129 --> 00:20:04,470
I can't do this.

383
00:20:05,099 --> 00:20:08,000
I should just get it over with
and make myself clear.

384
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,270
I might feel bad for the time being,

385
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:13,130
but this is the right thing to do.

386
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,710
(Director's Office)

387
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,050
- Na Hee.
- Hey.

388
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,926
Is the director in there?

389
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:22,079
No. He's having a meeting
with hospital directors.

390
00:20:22,419 --> 00:20:23,795
I just left reports in his office.

391
00:20:23,819 --> 00:20:25,250
Did he leave already?

392
00:20:28,089 --> 00:20:30,329
What? He shouldn't
have brought it up.

393
00:20:31,059 --> 00:20:33,500
He's making things awkward.

394
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,190
Na Hee.

395
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,290
Mom, Dad.

396
00:21:32,859 --> 00:21:34,220
Hey, did you have dinner?

397
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:35,466
Not yet.

398
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:37,266
You are coming home early tonight.

399
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:39,730
Yes. The chicken sold out
earlier than usual.

400
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:42,340
Things have been like that
since we started delivery.

401
00:21:42,629 --> 00:21:44,776
I told you we should've
done it sooner.

402
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,315
Why would you not listen to me?

403
00:21:46,339 --> 00:21:47,976
It's just good that we started it.

404
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,585
Don't be so greedy for profits.

405
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:52,115
What? Look who's talking.

406
00:21:52,139 --> 00:21:55,256
It's you who always
talk about money.

407
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,426
I just try to economize
and save money.

408
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:59,295
It's nothing like being greedy.

409
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:01,226
That's enough.

410
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,825
If you keep being like this,
you might start fighting.

411
00:22:02,849 --> 00:22:05,619
This is what we do all the time.
It's no big deal.

412
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,736
I guess your mom can't
do otherwise than nag me...

413
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,135
every single day.

414
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,859
Let's just go home
and eat. I'm hungry.

415
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:14,599
Let's go.

416
00:23:55,629 --> 00:23:56,800
What?

417
00:23:57,569 --> 00:23:59,069
I should get going.

418
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:00,940
Do you want to stay and study more?

419
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,940
No, I should go.

420
00:24:03,169 --> 00:24:05,440
I was about to leave.

421
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,280
My pen.

422
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:15,520
Are you making
a detour again tonight?

423
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:16,950
You must be tired.

424
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:19,460
I still need to stick to my words.

425
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:22,730
A person's lifespan is inversely
proportional to his waistline.

426
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:25,760
You're not even fat.

427
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:28,610
It's good for me though.
I'm not bored this way.

428
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:31,899
Do you like it?

429
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,200
Me too.

430
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:39,010
We can talk and exercise.

431
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,026
The exam is not far off now.

432
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:44,210
I'm nervous already.

433
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:47,180
Is there anything you want to do
after the exam?

434
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,555
Like a bucket list.

435
00:24:48,579 --> 00:24:50,149
There are a lot of things
I want to try.

436
00:24:50,849 --> 00:24:53,095
I want to go to eat
something delicious.

437
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:54,690
I want to go on a trip.

438
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:57,370
What I want to do most is
getting a driver's license.

439
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,089
I don't have it yet.

440
00:25:00,359 --> 00:25:02,776
What about dating?
Do you not want to date a guy?

441
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,706
You know what I went through.

442
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:06,776
I don't want a guy in my life
for the time being.

443
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,139
I'll just focus on my studies.

444
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,809
I should pass
the transfer exam first though.

445
00:25:12,139 --> 00:25:14,285
Don't speak so hastily.

446
00:25:14,309 --> 00:25:16,486
You never know
what the future holds.

447
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:17,926
I'm pretty sure.

448
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:19,780
I will never date a guy.

449
00:25:20,379 --> 00:25:22,720
- No.
- Why not?

450
00:25:23,819 --> 00:25:25,589
You can't be like that.

451
00:25:26,059 --> 00:25:28,089
Why would you bar up
your heart like that?

452
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:30,906
You can't resist love
after one failure like that.

453
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:33,099
It's just so foolish of you.

454
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,069
Why are you yelling at me?

455
00:25:39,569 --> 00:25:42,300
Well... I wasn't yelling at you.

456
00:25:42,909 --> 00:25:45,569
I'm just worried...

457
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:49,285
you might not recognize a good guy
because of one failed love.

458
00:25:49,309 --> 00:25:51,409
I'm just saying this
for caution's sake.

459
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,720
I guess I should go this way.

460
00:25:55,079 --> 00:25:56,250
Bye. I'll see you tomorrow.

461
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:58,966
Bye. See you.

462
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:00,589
Thank you for today.

463
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,419
Cha-cha-cha.

464
00:26:35,089 --> 00:26:36,490
- My gosh.
- We can't do this.

465
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:38,406
It's not working.

466
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,676
Why not?

467
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,706
I didn't get the hang of it yet.

468
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:43,506
And you're just as bad as I am.

469
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:45,145
We can't enter a contest like this.

470
00:26:45,169 --> 00:26:46,770
It will be just humiliating.

471
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,369
So what? Do you want to quit?

472
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:51,409
That's not what I'm saying.

473
00:26:51,639 --> 00:26:54,710
I might be able to pull it off
with someone better.

474
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:57,280
Who? Cho Yeon?

475
00:26:58,149 --> 00:27:00,625
She said she isn't interested,

476
00:27:00,649 --> 00:27:03,026
and however much you cry for her,

477
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:05,690
the reality is that Jang Ok Ja,
I am your partner.

478
00:27:05,819 --> 00:27:08,196
So, will you practice hard
for 30 more minutes,

479
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,889
or shall we practice all night?

480
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,990
30 minutes.

481
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:13,260
30 minutes?

482
00:27:13,859 --> 00:27:16,399
Okay. Let's start
from the beginning.

483
00:27:16,629 --> 00:27:18,169
- Stay alert.
- Okay.

484
00:27:19,569 --> 00:27:22,270
Here. The starting stance. And go.

485
00:27:23,569 --> 00:27:25,585
1, 2, cha-cha-cha.

486
00:27:25,609 --> 00:27:28,379
3, 4, cha-cha-cha. Pose.

487
00:27:32,879 --> 00:27:35,950
Mom, I'm home. Dad, I'm back.

488
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:41,419
- You're home.
- Yes.

489
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:44,430
How do you feel today?

490
00:27:45,389 --> 00:27:47,436
I feel fine. Let's study.

491
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,129
- Let's make up for yesterday.
- Okay.

492
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:53,639
Wow, you got it right.

493
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,569
This question
is about differentials.

494
00:27:57,669 --> 00:28:01,040
Good for you. You got better at
solving the complicated ones.

495
00:28:01,409 --> 00:28:03,349
My tutoring is working.

496
00:28:03,909 --> 00:28:07,720
See? You're improving
because you have a great tutor.

497
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:09,419
Yes. You're right.

498
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:12,125
It's all about the tutor.

499
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:15,095
That's right.
I'm an expensive tutor.

500
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:16,290
Next question.

501
00:28:20,859 --> 00:28:22,869
F of x is...

502
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,480
Na Hee said I'm doing well.

503
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:38,680
Why did she send
such a cute emoticon?

504
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,050
This is crazy.

505
00:28:44,119 --> 00:28:45,849
Congratulations. Good luck.

506
00:28:53,099 --> 00:28:55,329
I owe you. Night night.

507
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:00,040
What was that for?
Why did she say "night night"?

508
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:01,639
How cute!

509
00:29:03,639 --> 00:29:05,040
"Night night."

510
00:29:13,379 --> 00:29:14,480
My goodness.

511
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:16,550
What's going on?

512
00:29:17,619 --> 00:29:18,895
What are you doing?

513
00:29:18,919 --> 00:29:21,290
Can't you see?
I'm cleaning the bathroom.

514
00:29:21,859 --> 00:29:23,305
Why are you doing that for?

515
00:29:23,329 --> 00:29:24,766
I cleaned it already.

516
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:27,375
It's great for when you want to
stop thinking about something.

517
00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:29,260
You should've told me so!

518
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:30,899
Stop thinking about what?

519
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,000
Did something happen at
the hospital today?

520
00:29:33,899 --> 00:29:36,075
- Move.
- Wait, I want to wash my hands.

521
00:29:36,099 --> 00:29:38,470
- Get out.
- But I want to...

522
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,825
Yes, director.

523
00:29:48,849 --> 00:29:52,490
He's a newbie and not ready yet.

524
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,260
Can I bring the other guy...

525
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:57,690
What? Why would you say that, sir?

526
00:29:58,359 --> 00:30:00,030
You'll hire another stunt team?

527
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:02,575
You know how hard
I worked to get here.

528
00:30:02,599 --> 00:30:04,099
How can you say that?

529
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:07,375
Then I'll do what I can
to persuade him,

530
00:30:07,399 --> 00:30:09,045
and bring him to the shoot...

531
00:30:09,069 --> 00:30:11,510
And this is not the right time
for someone to call me.

532
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,256
Okay.

533
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:17,079
I got your point.
Let's do this instead.

534
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,280
Joon Seon.

535
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:22,079
I think I'm almost healed.
I jumped rope 100 times.

536
00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:24,625
Good. Congratulations, Jeong Bong.
Don't overdo it.

537
00:30:24,649 --> 00:30:26,190
You. Let's talk.

538
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,760
What's going on? Why did they
go out when they could talk here?

539
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:39,200
Exactly. Do you think
they're discussing a secret?

540
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:42,200
A secret? Like what? What secret?

541
00:30:43,069 --> 00:30:44,339
What secret?

542
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:48,609
What secret could Joon Seon
possibly keep from us?

543
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:51,309
Sorry. I'm not angry with you.

544
00:30:57,389 --> 00:30:58,990
Fine. You take 30.

545
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:00,889
- What?
- Your pay.

546
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:04,835
Stuntmen sign with a team
and share the profits.

547
00:31:04,859 --> 00:31:08,236
I take 50, Jeong Bong takes 30,
and Jong Soo takes 20 percent.

548
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:10,300
But especially for you,
you can take 30.

549
00:31:10,599 --> 00:31:13,815
But honestly, shouldn't we
give Jeong Bong 10 percent?

550
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:15,375
He got hurt too.

551
00:31:15,399 --> 00:31:17,740
That means I get 40 percent.
I'll take that.

552
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:19,986
It's not about the pay.

553
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:24,180
Okay, fine. 40.
You can take 40 percent.

554
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:26,256
It's not just for a few days.

555
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,220
Let's say I'm investing in you.

556
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:31,196
This is an exceptional deal
for a rookie.

557
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:33,790
You can't tell Jeong Bong
and Jong Soo, okay?

558
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:36,220
- Joon Seon.
- What? Talk freely.

559
00:31:36,359 --> 00:31:39,460
Don't hesitate. Share your opinion.

560
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,430
I'll say it again. I'm not
interested in doing stunts.

561
00:31:42,899 --> 00:31:44,770
Nor will I strike a deal
with my pay.

562
00:31:46,599 --> 00:31:48,875
Give Jeong Bong
whatever stunts he can handle.

563
00:31:48,899 --> 00:31:52,345
Hey, hey. I want to
do that if I could.

564
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:54,516
But you're the one
the director wants.

565
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:57,325
I told him you're our newbie
and I can't take it back now.

566
00:31:57,349 --> 00:31:58,726
Tell him the truth.

567
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,926
What truth? This job is
all about trust and credit.

568
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:05,220
Should I tell the director,
"It's a lie that he's our newbie"?

569
00:32:06,419 --> 00:32:08,236
Hey, Hyo Sin. Come on.

570
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,690
I'm off to work.

571
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:26,609
Na Hee, wait for me!

572
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,409
Where are you going?

573
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:31,250
To a job interview.

574
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,480
What?

575
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:36,379
The clothing store
asked me to come in.

576
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,125
You didn't say so earlier.

577
00:32:38,149 --> 00:32:40,266
What if I did
and didn't get the job?

578
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:41,960
I'll never survive Dad's scorn.

579
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,359
I smell cigarettes.

580
00:32:45,559 --> 00:32:48,305
Who the heck smoked here
so early in the morning?

581
00:32:48,329 --> 00:32:51,300
- Jerks should...
- Wait. Ga Hee.

582
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,669
Isn't this mine?

583
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,815
Gosh, look at the time.

584
00:32:56,839 --> 00:32:58,740
Let's hurry. I might be late.

585
00:32:58,869 --> 00:33:01,256
Ga Hee! Did you wear
some of my other clothes too?

586
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,280
- I'm late!
- Is it your second time?

587
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:12,295
(Resume)

588
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:14,990
Managing a clothing store
is hard work.

589
00:33:15,589 --> 00:33:19,359
Even more so because
we deal with men and women.

590
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:23,230
You need to be tactful
and it helps if you're young too.

591
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:26,800
Oh, I see.

592
00:33:27,399 --> 00:33:31,045
But then younger people
are bad at dealing with customers...

593
00:33:31,069 --> 00:33:32,609
and quit for no reason.

594
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,486
Give it a go.

595
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:39,609
You're a mom,
so you must be responsible.

596
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:44,595
Did I just get the job?

597
00:33:44,619 --> 00:33:46,619
Yes. You can start tomorrow.

598
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:50,365
Thank you so much.

599
00:33:50,389 --> 00:33:53,535
Did I tell you that
you're beautiful?

600
00:33:53,559 --> 00:33:54,559
I didn't, did I?

601
00:33:54,829 --> 00:33:58,030
I wanted to say so for a while.
You're so beautiful.

602
00:33:58,829 --> 00:33:59,875
Thank you.

603
00:33:59,899 --> 00:34:01,976
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Sure.

604
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,639
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

605
00:34:13,849 --> 00:34:14,855
Hi, Mom.

606
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:17,390
Ji Hun! I passed the interview.

607
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:20,359
Mom got a job!

608
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:22,660
You did? Congratulations, Mom.

609
00:34:23,189 --> 00:34:24,260
Thanks.

610
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:27,359
Now I'll get you
everything you want.

611
00:34:27,499 --> 00:34:29,705
I'll dress you in designer labels
from head to toe,

612
00:34:29,729 --> 00:34:31,530
and send you to violin lessons.

613
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,399
I don't need designer clothes.

614
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:35,769
And I'm not interested in
learning the violin.

615
00:34:36,269 --> 00:34:39,640
You're not? Then think about
what you'd like to do.

616
00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:42,839
Let's meet up after your class.

617
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:45,850
I'll treat you to celebrate.
What do you want to eat?

618
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,149
Shall we eat lobster?

619
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:51,850
No, that's hard to digest.
Bring some tteokbokki.

620
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:53,966
What, just tteokbokki?

621
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:55,859
Yes. I want tteokbokki.

622
00:34:57,589 --> 00:34:59,736
The bell just went. Bye.

623
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,760
Bye.

624
00:35:06,069 --> 00:35:07,100
He's so thoughtful.

625
00:35:08,839 --> 00:35:11,569
Yes. Mom got carried away.

626
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:15,280
I wasn't paid yet.
I can't afford lobster.

627
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:19,850
Yes. Today, we'll have tteokbokki!

628
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:27,040
(Episode 38)

629
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:33,550
(Song Joon Seon)

630
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:42,159
Hyo Sin, help me this once.

631
00:35:49,659 --> 00:35:51,670
My body's aching all over.

632
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:54,876
We're both inept dancers,
but we're forcing ourselves...

633
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,640
to practice for the competition.

634
00:35:56,970 --> 00:35:58,640
It's killing me.

635
00:35:58,809 --> 00:36:02,156
It would've been better
to team up with Ms. Kang.

636
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,255
Exactly!

637
00:36:03,279 --> 00:36:05,979
She would've agreed to it
in a few days,

638
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,650
but your sister-in-law
can get greedy at times.

639
00:36:08,949 --> 00:36:11,150
She might even make you
hand over this store for free.

640
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:15,096
I will if that's what she wants.

641
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,959
It's not like I can run it forever.

642
00:36:17,959 --> 00:36:19,260
Are you serious about that?

643
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:20,806
What about Joon Seon or Ga Hee?

644
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:23,199
Ga Hee's too lazy for the job.

645
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,029
And Joon Seon thinks that
being a stuntman is his calling.

646
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,670
Who am I to stop him
from doing what he loves?

647
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:33,640
Still, he's starring
in a new TV series...

648
00:36:33,769 --> 00:36:35,756
and he showed us
a video of it last night.

649
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:36,879
Really?

650
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:39,509
Your son is on a roll then.

651
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:41,526
There's no need
to worry about him anymore.

652
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:43,519
Gosh, he still has a long way to go.

653
00:36:44,849 --> 00:36:47,149
- Would you like to see it?
- Sure.

654
00:36:48,319 --> 00:36:52,435
My grandson sent over this video.

655
00:36:52,459 --> 00:36:53,959
Here we go. There.

656
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:58,845
He has a lean body just like me...

657
00:36:58,869 --> 00:37:00,330
and is quite athletic.

658
00:37:00,769 --> 00:37:03,069
Look at him go!

659
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:05,045
Is this Joon Seon?

660
00:37:05,069 --> 00:37:06,086
No.

661
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:08,679
This guy flying across the room.

662
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:11,385
What do you mean he's flying?
He only jumped.

663
00:37:11,409 --> 00:37:13,379
He jumped over another person.

664
00:37:13,409 --> 00:37:14,855
- That's flying.
- Let me see that again.

665
00:37:14,879 --> 00:37:17,080
All right. Watch closely this time.

666
00:37:19,019 --> 00:37:20,595
Did you see him fly just now?

667
00:37:20,619 --> 00:37:21,860
- Was that Joon Seon?
- Yes!

668
00:37:22,659 --> 00:37:24,060
What? You're in?

669
00:37:24,289 --> 00:37:25,659
I'm super glad to hear that.

670
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:27,875
I'll make sure you never regret it.

671
00:37:27,899 --> 00:37:29,429
Thank you so much, Hyo Sin.

672
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:32,130
I'll do it if Mr. Song allows me to.

673
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,776
He will, so don't you worry.

674
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,140
Why would he say no
when my career's on the line?

675
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,910
I'm talking about
my job as the delivery guy.

676
00:37:40,309 --> 00:37:41,380
What?

677
00:37:43,179 --> 00:37:44,309
So...

678
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:46,380
I'm supposed
to let you have Hyo Sin...

679
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:48,980
and use this delivery app instead?

680
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,119
That's right.

681
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:52,890
I'll pay 30 percent
of the commission.

682
00:37:53,589 --> 00:37:55,095
And how much would that be?

683
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:56,219
I looked into it...

684
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:57,836
and based on our sales,

685
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,890
the commission
will be twice my salary.

686
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,830
It may be more
when sales go up in the summer.

687
00:38:03,559 --> 00:38:05,469
Then 30 percent is not enough.

688
00:38:06,029 --> 00:38:07,100
50 percent.

689
00:38:07,469 --> 00:38:08,540
Dad, please.

690
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:09,939
You're being calculative.

691
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,086
I haven't even received
my first paycheck yet.

692
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:13,140
How about 35 percent?

693
00:38:13,369 --> 00:38:16,080
I can't cut you slack
because you're my son.

694
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:18,010
40 percent.

695
00:38:18,809 --> 00:38:19,950
Seriously?

696
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:21,619
Joon Seon,

697
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:23,625
- agree to the 40 percent...
- What?

698
00:38:23,649 --> 00:38:24,950
Or I'll turn down your offer.

699
00:38:26,519 --> 00:38:28,519
Okay, fine. 40 percent!

700
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,790
You mean business,
don't you, Mr. Song?

701
00:38:30,929 --> 00:38:33,106
Do we have a deal then?

702
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:34,730
- Here.
- Just do your job properly...

703
00:38:35,029 --> 00:38:36,669
and don't put Hyo Sin
through the wringer.

704
00:38:37,369 --> 00:38:38,929
A good job is what I'm trying to do.

705
00:38:40,269 --> 00:38:41,300
Here.

706
00:38:41,469 --> 00:38:42,709
It's only for this show though.

707
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:46,170
The handshake wasn't meant for you.

708
00:38:46,339 --> 00:38:48,110
Joon Seon, let's do this.

709
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:49,739
Sure thing!

710
00:38:59,689 --> 00:39:02,219
Here are the doctor's notes
and medical records you requested.

711
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:05,330
The doctors at the other hospital
can conduct basic tests again.

712
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,459
Yes, thank you.

713
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:09,529
It's her mom, right?

714
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,400
The child abuse victim
that Dr. Song reported.

715
00:39:11,429 --> 00:39:13,646
Yes, the girl's dad is out on bail.

716
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:14,869
- Really?
- Yes.

717
00:39:15,739 --> 00:39:18,769
She was staying at her sister's, but
now she's moving to the countryside.

718
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:20,285
They're switching hospitals too.

719
00:39:20,309 --> 00:39:21,679
Gosh, how terrifying.

720
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:23,880
I knew he was terrible
from the start.

721
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,709
That dragon tattoo on his arm...

722
00:39:41,059 --> 00:39:43,699
Your coffee is out.
Aren't you getting it?

723
00:39:45,499 --> 00:39:47,129
Oh, right.

724
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:49,639
Go ahead.

725
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:02,050
What now?

726
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:04,500
Is there anything else
you want to give me advice on?

727
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:06,449
Not exactly.

728
00:40:07,389 --> 00:40:08,619
Did you hear that...

729
00:40:08,819 --> 00:40:10,360
the child abuse victim's dad...

730
00:40:10,989 --> 00:40:12,929
made bail recently?

731
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:15,230
I did when printing out
my notes for her.

732
00:40:16,429 --> 00:40:18,305
The law is lenient, if you ask me.

733
00:40:18,329 --> 00:40:19,800
What about the kid and her mom?

734
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:22,900
A restraining order?
How can that ensure their safety?

735
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:26,086
Instead of worrying only about them,

736
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:27,579
worry about yourself more.

737
00:40:27,939 --> 00:40:29,715
You're the one
who reported him to the police.

738
00:40:29,739 --> 00:40:30,886
There's no need to worry...

739
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:34,379
because thugs only go after
those weaker than them.

740
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:37,749
You should've seen him cower
in front of the police.

741
00:40:37,819 --> 00:40:39,225
Still...

742
00:40:39,249 --> 00:40:41,089
You must have
a lot of free time on your hands.

743
00:40:41,619 --> 00:40:43,720
First, you're giving me advice
on my love life...

744
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,989
and now you're worrying
about my safety.

745
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:50,499
It's not because
I have a lot of free time.

746
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:53,129
You know how considerate I can be.

747
00:40:53,429 --> 00:40:55,646
Guys, hurry on over
to the conference room.

748
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:57,470
Gi Yeong's mom sent over dinner.

749
00:40:57,639 --> 00:41:00,139
Her pork cutlet restaurant
is a big hit these days.

750
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:02,040
- Hurry.
- Pork cutlets?

751
00:41:02,179 --> 00:41:03,679
Perfect timing.

752
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:06,809
She's too gutsy for her own good.

753
00:41:07,819 --> 00:41:09,020
Too gutsy.

754
00:41:10,249 --> 00:41:11,496
My gosh. What is all this?

755
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,819
Guys, come quick.

756
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:14,735
You have no idea
how crunchy they are.

757
00:41:14,759 --> 00:41:16,059
They're to die for.

758
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,360
It looks delicious.

759
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:20,636
What about Dr. Yoon?
Did he head home?

760
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:21,900
He left a while ago.

761
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:23,900
He's awfully busy these days.

762
00:41:24,199 --> 00:41:25,605
Anyway, thanks, Gi Yeong.

763
00:41:25,629 --> 00:41:26,776
- Please enjoy.
- Thanks.

764
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,170
Did I hear, pork cutlets?
Is there some for me too?

765
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:30,439
Yes, right here.

766
00:41:30,739 --> 00:41:31,910
Let's sit.

767
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:34,309
Thanks to Dr. Han,

768
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:37,579
we're enjoying a great treat today.

769
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:39,130
Where's your mother's
restaurant again?

770
00:41:39,509 --> 00:41:40,486
Hanam, sir.

771
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:43,456
If it were close by,
I'd go there often.

772
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,249
Hanam isn't that far though.

773
00:41:45,819 --> 00:41:48,689
We should go there for
a team dinner sometime to thank her.

774
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:49,960
Sure.

775
00:41:51,329 --> 00:41:53,465
Sorry about that.
How unilateral of me.

776
00:41:53,489 --> 00:41:55,376
I should've asked
for your opinions first.

777
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,605
- No, it's a great idea.
- I love the idea too.

778
00:41:57,629 --> 00:41:58,829
Sounds good to me.

779
00:41:59,199 --> 00:42:01,746
Okay, let's eat then.
Enjoy, everyone.

780
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:02,770
Sure.

781
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:04,840
Director Lee,

782
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,509
can we eat later...

783
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,939
and talk for a bit first?

784
00:42:17,319 --> 00:42:18,489
Dig in, guys.

785
00:42:28,429 --> 00:42:29,960
We should talk.

786
00:42:31,129 --> 00:42:32,429
We should,

787
00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:34,100
but here?

788
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:36,340
Right.

789
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:38,040
It's not something to say at work.

790
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:39,780
Should we take it outside then?

791
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:41,540
Sure.

792
00:42:41,579 --> 00:42:43,809
We were about
to get off work anyway.

793
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,309
We'll take my car.

794
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:54,559
Did she get off work or not?

795
00:42:55,989 --> 00:42:58,129
What on earth did
she and Jeong Rok talk about?

796
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,460
Unbelievable.

797
00:43:01,929 --> 00:43:03,276
It's none of your business,

798
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:05,300
so don't even be curious.

799
00:43:08,569 --> 00:43:09,639
Gyu Jin,

800
00:43:09,739 --> 00:43:10,800
didn't you leave yet?

801
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:12,470
Right.

802
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:15,355
Well, I was thinking
about engaging myself...

803
00:43:15,379 --> 00:43:17,650
in a medial discussion
with Dr. Song,

804
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:20,280
but maybe I'll do it tomorrow.
Bye, guys.

805
00:43:24,850 --> 00:43:27,150
- We didn't ask.
- What's up with him?

806
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:49,139
Gosh.

807
00:43:50,809 --> 00:43:53,410
I thought I needed
to stay fit to be a medical student,

808
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:56,179
so I came out here
to shoot hoops every night.

809
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,065
I liked how the bouncing ball...

810
00:43:59,089 --> 00:44:01,859
sounded like my heartbeat.

811
00:44:05,929 --> 00:44:07,030
All right then.

812
00:44:08,599 --> 00:44:10,030
My heart-rate is up,

813
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,900
so say what's on your mind.

814
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:20,809
Jeong Rok, I'm not in a state...

815
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:25,079
where I can afford
to date anyone right now.

816
00:44:26,979 --> 00:44:28,150
But...

817
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:30,380
now that I know how you feel,

818
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:33,349
I don't think
we should eat and talk...

819
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:35,760
like we once used to.

820
00:44:37,890 --> 00:44:40,535
I don't want to give you
a sense of hope...

821
00:44:40,559 --> 00:44:43,059
when I'm in no position
to handle the fallout.

822
00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:47,199
I'm not so sure.

823
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:50,170
It doesn't seem that bad to me.

824
00:44:54,679 --> 00:44:56,380
Keep giving me hope, I mean.

825
00:44:58,609 --> 00:44:59,809
Our emotions move...

826
00:45:00,109 --> 00:45:02,449
in different directions
at different speeds.

827
00:45:03,949 --> 00:45:07,050
The one who developed feelings first
can wait...

828
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:10,660
for the other
to realize their true feelings too.

829
00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:14,329
Giving hope to the one waiting...

830
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,729
is like the food we live on.

831
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:20,370
Without it...

832
00:45:25,809 --> 00:45:26,969
To be honest,

833
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:31,250
I blurted out my feelings
and wanted to gain time to think.

834
00:45:33,209 --> 00:45:35,349
I didn't know what to do next.

835
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:38,990
But...

836
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:41,219
now I do.

837
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:44,490
Bulldozing my way in
is not the answer.

838
00:45:45,530 --> 00:45:46,530
Jeong Rok...

839
00:45:46,859 --> 00:45:47,859
Leave me...

840
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:50,660
some hope, will you?

841
00:45:52,969 --> 00:45:54,670
It'll be what I hold onto as I wait.

842
00:46:00,439 --> 00:46:02,119
It's too bad
if I can't at least have that.

843
00:46:04,179 --> 00:46:06,510
All right then. Here.

844
00:46:07,609 --> 00:46:08,679
Want to give it a try?

845
00:46:09,079 --> 00:46:11,189
Running around a bit
helps you sleep at night.

846
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:15,790
Over here.

847
00:46:16,819 --> 00:46:17,829
Shoot.

848
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:20,990
- That was close.
- You almost scored.

849
00:46:26,829 --> 00:46:28,400
Okay, that's good.

850
00:46:33,439 --> 00:46:34,439
And here.

851
00:46:47,449 --> 00:46:49,966
I'm buying to celebrate
my finding a job,

852
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:51,236
so eat up.

853
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:53,059
You never go big, do you?

854
00:46:53,089 --> 00:46:54,335
A celebration dinner...

855
00:46:54,359 --> 00:46:56,405
should at least involve
tangsuyuk and jajangmyeon.

856
00:46:56,429 --> 00:46:59,130
My son's the one
who wanted tteokbokki.

857
00:46:59,329 --> 00:47:00,346
Isn't that right?

858
00:47:00,370 --> 00:47:02,545
Yes, I was craving it today,

859
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:03,616
and it's delicious.

860
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:06,146
Who cares if
it's tteokbokki or sundae?

861
00:47:06,170 --> 00:47:08,455
What matters is that
she got herself a job.

862
00:47:08,479 --> 00:47:12,055
Who'll look after Seo Jin
now that Ga Hee has a job?

863
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:14,695
Don't worry.
I can take her to work with us.

864
00:47:14,719 --> 00:47:16,496
It's not like
she comes over every day.

865
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:17,497
I guess you're right.

866
00:47:17,521 --> 00:47:19,466
Anyway, it sure is
a good day for our family.

867
00:47:19,490 --> 00:47:21,996
Ga Hee found a job
and I signed a deal with Hyo Sin.

868
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:23,496
What? Really?

869
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,966
Is Hyo Sin
a member of your squad too?

870
00:47:25,990 --> 00:47:27,760
Of course. We're brothers now.

871
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:29,675
No way.

872
00:47:29,699 --> 00:47:31,846
He's too handsome
to be part of your team,

873
00:47:31,870 --> 00:47:33,670
but this is good for you.

874
00:47:33,929 --> 00:47:36,699
Every team needs
a visually stunning member, right?

875
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:39,170
If only he wasn't
the obvious choice.

876
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,685
Don't exhaust him
for no particular reason...

877
00:47:42,709 --> 00:47:43,780
and look after him.

878
00:47:44,179 --> 00:47:46,880
Hyo Sin, do your best
since you agreed to do it.

879
00:47:47,010 --> 00:47:48,079
Sure, Mr. Song.

880
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:50,256
Don't worry, Dad.

881
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:52,390
All I'm worried about
is how successful we'll be.

882
00:47:54,219 --> 00:47:56,620
Now that you mention it,
I don't see Chestnut.

883
00:47:56,689 --> 00:47:57,766
Did he go somewhere?

884
00:47:57,790 --> 00:47:59,859
He was tired, so he turned in early.

885
00:48:01,829 --> 00:48:03,276
What? It's Mom!

886
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:05,175
She'll be mad
when she finds out I'm here.

887
00:48:05,199 --> 00:48:08,370
But I told her you were here
when she called earlier.

888
00:48:09,270 --> 00:48:10,969
Seo Jin, your mom's here. Let's go.

889
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:12,709
She's going to kill you.

890
00:48:16,939 --> 00:48:18,386
Seo Young,
this is your last warning.

891
00:48:18,410 --> 00:48:20,150
Don't you dare skip classes again,

892
00:48:20,709 --> 00:48:22,069
or I'll kick you out of the house.

893
00:48:22,579 --> 00:48:25,466
Sounds good to me.
I can stay at Grandpa's.

894
00:48:25,490 --> 00:48:26,467
Don't get cheeky with me.

895
00:48:26,491 --> 00:48:30,459
Sorry, Mom.
I won't skip my classes again.

896
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:32,466
Also, starting from
the day after tomorrow,

897
00:48:32,490 --> 00:48:34,559
head to Grandpa's chicken place
after studying.

898
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,575
Take Seo Jin home and babysit
until I get home.

899
00:48:38,599 --> 00:48:39,576
Why?

900
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,229
Your aunt has a job now.

901
00:48:41,370 --> 00:48:43,445
Your grandma and grandpa
have enough on their plate,

902
00:48:43,469 --> 00:48:45,510
so how can I ask them
to watch Seo Jin all night?

903
00:48:46,569 --> 00:48:47,815
I'll get home as soon as possible.

904
00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:51,709
But then I can't hang out
with my friends.

905
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:54,510
Help me out here, Seo Young.

906
00:48:55,079 --> 00:48:57,126
You can hang out with them
some other time.

907
00:48:57,150 --> 00:48:59,449
Whatever. You're so annoying.

908
00:49:05,689 --> 00:49:08,729
I can't believe them.

909
00:49:09,699 --> 00:49:12,400
They know how much
I love tteokbokki and sundae,

910
00:49:12,569 --> 00:49:13,569
but still...

911
00:49:16,569 --> 00:49:20,910
Jeong Bong, are you asleep?
I stole some sundae for you.

912
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:23,209
Have some, okay?

913
00:49:24,949 --> 00:49:28,179
Gosh, I know
you're upset about this...

914
00:49:28,949 --> 00:49:32,266
and it breaks my heart
to see you sit this one out.

915
00:49:32,290 --> 00:49:33,420
Did you know that?

916
00:49:34,089 --> 00:49:35,959
Besides, this isn't
our last project together.

917
00:49:36,589 --> 00:49:39,106
I'll snag another gig for us...

918
00:49:39,130 --> 00:49:41,335
and make sure
you get your chance to fly.

919
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:45,099
So get over it and have some sundae.

920
00:49:46,170 --> 00:49:49,469
You're disappointing me
by being this way.

921
00:49:57,780 --> 00:50:00,050
- Joon Seon.
- All right.

922
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:02,620
I brought liver, your favorite,
so have some.

923
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:04,280
Here.

924
00:50:10,290 --> 00:50:11,790
- Joon Seon...
- Get in here.

925
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:19,099
I know how you feel
and I'm sorry about it.

926
00:50:19,870 --> 00:50:22,300
I thought...

927
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:26,209
that you had abandoned me.

928
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:30,510
You only seemed
to care about Hyo Sin.

929
00:50:31,209 --> 00:50:33,780
Are you seriously
comparing yourself to him?

930
00:50:34,179 --> 00:50:36,750
You guys are all I have.

931
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,620
Hyo Sin's standoffish attitude
makes it hard for me to like him.

932
00:50:39,949 --> 00:50:42,260
I'll use him for this project
and kick him to the curb.

933
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,729
Why on earth are you crying?

934
00:50:45,990 --> 00:50:48,035
Now, eat up. You too, Jong Soo.

935
00:50:48,059 --> 00:50:49,130
Sure.

936
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:50,606
The tteokbokki...

937
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:52,130
- Tteokbokki?
- I wanted some.

938
00:50:52,929 --> 00:50:54,199
Hyo Sin, good luck.

939
00:50:55,270 --> 00:50:58,716
I might not be around the gym
as often though.

940
00:50:58,740 --> 00:50:59,809
Is that all right?

941
00:50:59,969 --> 00:51:02,010
It's fine.
I'll keep training on my own.

942
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:05,650
Good. I'll let the trainer know.
He'll look after you.

943
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:08,520
Ji Hun!

944
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:12,719
How dare you touch my child?

945
00:51:12,849 --> 00:51:14,050
Mom, please.

946
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:15,890
He's my son, okay?

947
00:51:16,819 --> 00:51:18,539
You should head inside
and do your homework.

948
00:51:19,530 --> 00:51:20,630
Clean up the rest then.

949
00:51:30,839 --> 00:51:32,640
(Unnie's Kimbap)

950
00:51:44,949 --> 00:51:47,349
What are you doing here?
Shouldn't you be at practice?

951
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:50,266
I haven't had dinner yet,
so I thought I'd grab a bite to eat.

952
00:51:50,290 --> 00:51:53,729
Don't be ridiculous.
We can't waste a second of our time.

953
00:51:54,030 --> 00:51:56,476
Now, stop this nonsense
and lead the way.

954
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:59,146
We need to practice. Come on!

955
00:51:59,170 --> 00:52:01,815
You'll ruin my sweater.
It's expensive, you know.

956
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:03,500
- Come on!
- Fine, I'm going.

957
00:52:05,339 --> 00:52:08,510
Mr. Yang hasn't been around
that much lately. Is he busy?

958
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:11,756
He's entering
that dance competition.

959
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:13,579
He must be busy practicing.

960
00:52:14,010 --> 00:52:16,579
Still, he's not one
to not stop by the place.

961
00:52:17,979 --> 00:52:20,195
Could he have fallen
for someone else?

962
00:52:20,219 --> 00:52:21,660
Really?

963
00:52:22,219 --> 00:52:24,390
Will we no longer
receive free beef then?

964
00:52:25,089 --> 00:52:27,705
Gosh, that's too bad.

965
00:52:27,729 --> 00:52:30,075
I'm weaker now that I haven't had...

966
00:52:30,099 --> 00:52:31,676
my daily fix of beef.

967
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:34,869
Shut it, you two.
Will you be scrubbing all night?

968
00:52:35,099 --> 00:52:36,545
Anyway, make sure you scrub well.

969
00:52:36,569 --> 00:52:39,609
The surface was sticky
even after cleaning up yesterday.

970
00:52:41,909 --> 00:52:42,909
Sure thing.

971
00:52:47,879 --> 00:52:50,480
(Chi Su's Butcher Shop)

972
00:52:51,990 --> 00:52:53,149
He's not here.

973
00:52:53,950 --> 00:52:55,159
Where could he be?

974
00:52:57,490 --> 00:52:59,629
He must be upset about everything.

975
00:53:00,629 --> 00:53:03,835
Maybe I should've just caved in
and agreed to be his partner.

976
00:53:03,859 --> 00:53:05,129
Why did I play hard to get?

977
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:10,369
I thought I'd get him smiling again
with a few rolls of kimbap.

978
00:53:11,909 --> 00:53:13,069
Where is he anyway?

979
00:53:15,309 --> 00:53:16,309
Gosh, I'm hungry.

980
00:53:20,550 --> 00:53:21,819
It's so good.

981
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:31,690
These look good. Go ahead.

982
00:53:33,190 --> 00:53:35,476
I thought you were dragging me
toward the dance studio,

983
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:37,276
so what are we doing here?

984
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:39,169
You said you didn't have dinner yet.

985
00:53:39,899 --> 00:53:42,599
How can we dance
when you lack the energy?

986
00:53:43,869 --> 00:53:48,355
Also, shouldn't we
build our teamwork more?

987
00:53:48,379 --> 00:53:50,579
For better or worse,
we're stuck as partners.

988
00:53:52,309 --> 00:53:54,980
Sure thing. Let's eat.

989
00:53:55,419 --> 00:53:56,419
Here.

990
00:54:01,859 --> 00:54:04,395
I'm staying away from alcohol
for the time being.

991
00:54:04,419 --> 00:54:05,990
You see, I got wasted recently.

992
00:54:08,230 --> 00:54:09,260
Cheers.

993
00:54:09,829 --> 00:54:12,700
You shouldn't be drinking so much
at your age.

994
00:54:13,329 --> 00:54:17,339
One should only drink until
you're in the best mood.

995
00:54:20,970 --> 00:54:24,210
Gosh, that's good.
Sweet on the tongue.

996
00:54:28,050 --> 00:54:31,220
I mean, look here, Ms. Ok Ja.

997
00:54:31,889 --> 00:54:34,149
Let's be honest.

998
00:54:34,919 --> 00:54:38,159
Do you think I'm that unattractive?

999
00:54:38,490 --> 00:54:40,159
Am I just unlikable?

1000
00:54:42,899 --> 00:54:45,069
No, you're not unlikable.

1001
00:54:45,099 --> 00:54:46,930
I know. I'm not that bad, right?

1002
00:54:48,099 --> 00:54:50,145
Then why is Cho Yeon...

1003
00:54:50,169 --> 00:54:54,309
not interested in me at all?

1004
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:56,409
What's wrong with me?

1005
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,159
Ms. Ok Ja.

1006
00:55:17,859 --> 00:55:19,030
I want some food.

1007
00:55:58,510 --> 00:56:00,569
She's just unbelievable.

1008
00:56:01,210 --> 00:56:04,079
I've given her a lot of beef so far.

1009
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:06,250
You know what?

1010
00:56:06,879 --> 00:56:09,026
It wasn't just beef.

1011
00:56:09,050 --> 00:56:11,720
It's from my heart.

1012
00:56:13,419 --> 00:56:16,119
For me, that's what beef means.

1013
00:56:18,690 --> 00:56:20,930
If I gave her beef,

1014
00:56:21,059 --> 00:56:24,859
it means I gave her all my heart.

1015
00:56:28,470 --> 00:56:29,669
Mr. Yang.

1016
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:31,940
Are you crying?

1017
00:56:32,770 --> 00:56:38,010
I'm just frustrated. I'm so upset.

1018
00:56:39,879 --> 00:56:41,180
Stop crying.

1019
00:56:42,050 --> 00:56:43,280
Will you stop crying?

1020
00:56:45,149 --> 00:56:46,520
What's the big deal about her?

1021
00:56:47,349 --> 00:56:50,159
Why are you being so pathetic
because of her? It's upsetting.

1022
00:56:51,990 --> 00:56:53,589
Are you a fool?

1023
00:56:53,730 --> 00:56:54,960
Are you a moron?

1024
00:56:55,430 --> 00:56:57,476
Why would you cry
because of a woman...

1025
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:59,470
who doesn't even care about you?

1026
00:56:59,869 --> 00:57:02,270
With a woman who has a huge
crush on you sitting right here.

1027
00:57:03,470 --> 00:57:05,609
What do you mean?

1028
00:57:05,669 --> 00:57:07,740
Just think about it.
What would that mean?

1029
00:57:08,270 --> 00:57:11,680
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

1030
00:58:13,609 --> 00:58:14,940
Well... Ma'am.

1031
00:58:15,169 --> 00:58:16,639
What should I do first?

1032
00:58:17,710 --> 00:58:19,486
Do I have to tell you
what to do every time?

1033
00:58:19,510 --> 00:58:21,349
Just try to be more tactful.

1034
00:58:22,550 --> 00:58:24,419
Okay. Be tactful.

1035
00:58:25,450 --> 00:58:26,589
All right.

1036
00:58:28,089 --> 00:58:29,589
What should I do?

1037
00:58:31,889 --> 00:58:34,859
Ga Hee, I just organized them.

1038
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:39,829
I just thought it'd be better
to arrange them by color.

1039
00:58:40,530 --> 00:58:42,016
I'm quite picky about colors,

1040
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:45,609
so I tend to move to colors I like
when I shop for clothes.

1041
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:48,369
- I think, this way...
- Ga Hee.

1042
00:58:55,649 --> 00:58:58,690
Are you saying I just arranged them
randomly without thought?

1043
00:58:59,389 --> 00:59:01,550
Pardon? Gosh, no.

1044
00:59:02,059 --> 00:59:03,859
That's not what I meant.

1045
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:06,960
Customers prefer products
arranged by styles.

1046
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:09,476
I appreciate your positive attitude,

1047
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:11,460
but you should ask things
you don't know.

1048
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:13,430
It's not like
organizing your closet.

1049
00:59:15,470 --> 00:59:18,069
Okay. I'm sorry.
I'll make sure to ask.

1050
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:21,079
We're not having customers yet.
Just go straighten up the warehouse.

1051
00:59:21,109 --> 00:59:23,609
Carrying-overs inside
and new products outside.

1052
00:59:24,210 --> 00:59:25,409
Yes, ma'am.

1053
00:59:45,930 --> 00:59:47,230
Darn it.

1054
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:53,040
Gosh, I'm so tired.

1055
00:59:55,169 --> 00:59:56,510
She is such a wench.

1056
00:59:57,210 --> 00:59:58,609
She's even younger than me.

1057
00:59:58,649 --> 01:00:00,129
"Just go straighten up
the warehouse"?

1058
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:03,419
She could've asked me
to work on it.

1059
01:00:05,149 --> 01:00:06,490
This isn't feeling good.

1060
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:09,460
I guess I will explode
with rage pretty soon.

1061
01:00:13,230 --> 01:00:14,460
No.

1062
01:00:15,290 --> 01:00:16,906
I took the plunge
and started this job.

1063
01:00:16,930 --> 01:00:18,810
I should hold myself back
thinking about Ji Hun.

1064
01:00:19,970 --> 01:00:22,669
All right. I've had it too easy
the whole time.

1065
01:00:23,470 --> 01:00:24,800
I need to keep
my temper in check.

1066
01:00:28,809 --> 01:00:30,579
I'm so sleepy sitting in here.

1067
01:00:31,809 --> 01:00:33,349
I should go get some fresh air.

1068
01:00:40,119 --> 01:00:41,649
There's Mr. Yang.

1069
01:00:41,750 --> 01:00:43,095
I guess he's coming
to our restaurant.

1070
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:44,236
I knew it.
I thought I haven't seen him...

1071
01:00:44,260 --> 01:00:45,620
- for the past few days.
- Hello...

1072
01:00:48,230 --> 01:00:49,559
He's leaving.

1073
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:52,629
Where is he going?

1074
01:00:52,829 --> 01:00:55,075
You're right. Where is he going now?

1075
01:00:55,099 --> 01:00:56,369
I don't know. What's going on?

1076
01:01:01,510 --> 01:01:03,339
How adorable.

1077
01:01:03,579 --> 01:01:05,450
You're so sweet and lovely.

1078
01:01:06,609 --> 01:01:08,349
I guess she takes after her mom.

1079
01:01:08,450 --> 01:01:09,780
I think so.

1080
01:01:09,919 --> 01:01:11,919
I don't think
she takes after her dad.

1081
01:01:12,790 --> 01:01:14,526
She has well-defined features.

1082
01:01:14,550 --> 01:01:15,819
You're so pretty.

1083
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:21,329
It's not that Joon Seon is
not good-looking.

1084
01:01:21,490 --> 01:01:23,829
I know. He's not bad-looking.

1085
01:01:24,159 --> 01:01:25,700
It's not like
he's good-looking though.

1086
01:01:27,129 --> 01:01:28,530
So?

1087
01:01:28,569 --> 01:01:30,815
Did your first daughter
go to work today?

1088
01:01:30,839 --> 01:01:32,040
Sure.

1089
01:01:32,109 --> 01:01:34,145
As soon as she made up
her mind, she got a job.

1090
01:01:34,169 --> 01:01:36,480
She used to work.

1091
01:01:37,309 --> 01:01:40,186
Hey, you guys are here.

1092
01:01:40,210 --> 01:01:41,256
You're here.

1093
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:44,079
My husband just went to the office.
You missed each other on the way.

1094
01:01:44,349 --> 01:01:46,450
No. I just stopped by
to give this to you.

1095
01:01:46,690 --> 01:01:48,649
It's good for beef tartare.

1096
01:01:48,889 --> 01:01:50,059
My gosh.

1097
01:01:50,190 --> 01:01:52,059
It's for beef tartare.

1098
01:01:52,129 --> 01:01:54,990
You're so lucky
to get stuff like this.

1099
01:01:55,359 --> 01:01:57,230
Gosh, you don't have to do this.

1100
01:01:57,899 --> 01:01:59,099
Ok Ja.

1101
01:01:59,129 --> 01:02:01,230
It's for beef tartare,
your favorite dish.

1102
01:02:01,869 --> 01:02:03,599
Oh, really?

1103
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:07,940
I didn't know
Ok Ja likes beef tartare.

1104
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:16,520
Gosh, my eye.

1105
01:02:17,919 --> 01:02:19,426
Ms. Song, are you in the library?

1106
01:02:19,450 --> 01:02:20,790
I got off work early today.

1107
01:02:22,319 --> 01:02:24,766
Yes, I'm in the library.
See you soon.

1108
01:02:24,790 --> 01:02:26,159
I should be there soon.

1109
01:02:30,260 --> 01:02:31,760
Hey, Jae Seok.

1110
01:02:33,899 --> 01:02:35,940
Gosh. Jae Seok!

1111
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:40,186
What?

1112
01:02:40,210 --> 01:02:42,010
Where is he going in such haste?

1113
01:02:43,339 --> 01:02:44,740
Is it that he is...

1114
01:02:45,379 --> 01:02:47,050
I'm sure that's it.

1115
01:02:47,550 --> 01:02:50,879
He seems carried away. I'm sure
he's going to meet his girlfriend.

1116
01:02:51,780 --> 01:02:53,050
I got you.

1117
01:02:54,649 --> 01:02:56,389
Where did he go?

1118
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:07,369
What?

1119
01:03:08,169 --> 01:03:09,470
A library?

1120
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:12,510
He said his girlfriend is a student.

1121
01:03:12,839 --> 01:03:14,339
Are they meeting here?

1122
01:03:26,389 --> 01:03:27,819
- Mr. Yoon.
- Ms. Song.

1123
01:03:29,419 --> 01:03:30,460
Where did he go?

1124
01:03:33,460 --> 01:03:34,659
- You're here.
- Yes.

1125
01:03:34,930 --> 01:03:36,260
Are you going to the restroom?

1126
01:03:37,559 --> 01:03:40,169
No. I'm feeling sleepy,
so I need some coffee.

1127
01:03:43,639 --> 01:03:44,800
It's Da Hee.

1128
01:03:46,069 --> 01:03:47,210
Da Hee.

1129
01:03:48,369 --> 01:03:49,510
Jae Seok.

1130
01:03:50,780 --> 01:03:51,980
Mom.

1131
01:03:56,220 --> 01:03:59,550
I'm on my way. I just got off work.

1132
01:03:59,589 --> 01:04:02,020
You just came without calling me.
Why did you...

1133
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:05,730
Excuse me.

1134
01:04:13,930 --> 01:04:15,069
Well...

1135
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:17,759
You go on in. There must be
a lot of restaurants there.

1136
01:04:20,970 --> 01:04:22,169
Okay.

1137
01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:24,680
A seafood soup restaurant?

1138
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:26,085
Sounds good.

1139
01:04:26,109 --> 01:04:27,625
You go on in.
I'll be there in five minutes.

1140
01:04:27,649 --> 01:04:29,619
I knew he was terrible
from the start.

1141
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:31,419
That dragon tattoo on his arm...

1142
01:04:38,290 --> 01:04:39,290
No.

1143
01:04:39,859 --> 01:04:40,960
Oh, my gosh.

1144
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:11,159
Why won't you pick up?

1145
01:05:14,389 --> 01:05:15,460
(Yoon Gyu Jin)

1146
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:27,940
Nurse, are we done for the day?

1147
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:34,750
Who are you?

1148
01:05:42,319 --> 01:05:44,389
Who are you? Why are you here?

1149
01:05:52,059 --> 01:05:53,099
You don't get it.

1150
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:55,845
This is what I'll put on the form.

1151
01:05:55,869 --> 01:05:58,845
"Conclusion. Child abuse
at the hand of the birth father."

1152
01:05:58,869 --> 01:06:00,409
You're out of your mind.

1153
01:06:08,579 --> 01:06:10,020
You recognize me.

1154
01:06:10,849 --> 01:06:13,565
But then, you ruined my life
and I'd be disappointed...

1155
01:06:13,589 --> 01:06:15,450
if you didn't remember me.

1156
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:16,889
Why are you here?

1157
01:06:17,659 --> 01:06:18,659
What do you want?

1158
01:06:22,159 --> 01:06:24,829
What do I want? Here's what I want.

1159
01:06:25,770 --> 01:06:28,230
I did time because of you,

1160
01:06:28,369 --> 01:06:30,740
and since then,
my wife and kid moved.

1161
01:06:34,409 --> 01:06:35,740
Where did they go?

1162
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:39,649
You must know
if they kept coming here.

1163
01:06:40,849 --> 01:06:43,050
I don't know.
They haven't been here recently.

1164
01:06:43,950 --> 01:06:45,649
Do you expect me to believe that?

1165
01:06:46,950 --> 01:06:49,159
Do you have a death wish?

1166
01:06:50,889 --> 01:06:53,530
Darn you! Tell me.

1167
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:55,565
Tell me if you want to live!

1168
01:06:55,589 --> 01:06:57,206
I don't know. I really don't.

1169
01:06:57,230 --> 01:06:59,329
- Doctor, you can go home...
- Darn.

1170
01:06:59,770 --> 01:07:00,770
Darn you!

1171
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:04,569
Be quiet! What?

1172
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:07,169
What? What?

1173
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:11,579
If you want to save her,
bring my wife and kid!

1174
01:07:11,839 --> 01:07:12,879
Now!

1175
01:07:14,710 --> 01:07:16,926
Sir. Calm down first.

1176
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:18,280
I'm no sir.

1177
01:07:18,550 --> 01:07:20,395
Hey. You go.

1178
01:07:20,419 --> 01:07:22,595
Get my wife and daughter!

1179
01:07:22,619 --> 01:07:24,859
- We can't share information...
- Be quiet!

1180
01:07:28,159 --> 01:07:29,206
My gosh.

1181
01:07:29,230 --> 01:07:31,530
Don't just stand there. Go!

1182
01:07:31,629 --> 01:07:33,399
- Gyu Jin, what's going...
- Go!

1183
01:07:34,470 --> 01:07:36,115
- Get them now.
- Sir.

1184
01:07:36,139 --> 01:07:37,300
Get them!

1185
01:07:37,899 --> 01:07:39,270
Do it!

1186
01:07:39,809 --> 01:07:42,040
- Get my wife and daughter!
- Na Hee!

1187
01:07:54,349 --> 01:07:56,220
Who are you?

1188
01:07:58,659 --> 01:08:00,490
What do you want, you fool?

1189
01:08:00,730 --> 01:08:01,760
Are you okay?

1190
01:08:32,589 --> 01:08:35,030
(Once Again)

1191
01:08:35,530 --> 01:08:37,635
Ga Hee, you're still
hanging up the clothes?

1192
01:08:37,659 --> 01:08:38,906
I'm coming.

1193
01:08:38,930 --> 01:08:40,569
Isn't that Ga Hee?

1194
01:08:40,669 --> 01:08:42,470
This is what Song Ga Hee does now?

1195
01:08:42,869 --> 01:08:44,615
You're so sweet sometimes.

1196
01:08:44,639 --> 01:08:45,676
Not just sometimes.

1197
01:08:45,700 --> 01:08:48,409
It doesn't feel real. I'm trembling.

1198
01:08:48,669 --> 01:08:49,716
Right now?

1199
01:08:49,740 --> 01:08:50,980
Darn it.

1200
01:08:51,540 --> 01:08:52,950
Shoot.

1201
01:08:53,180 --> 01:08:54,526
Are you sure it didn't hit a nerve?

1202
01:08:54,550 --> 01:08:57,196
It's not your fault.
I didn't move fast enough.

1203
01:08:57,220 --> 01:08:59,825
I want you to be happy, Na Hee.

1204
01:08:59,849 --> 01:09:02,419
That's why you went through
the tough breakup.

1205
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:04,436
You help out at an orphanage?

1206
01:09:04,460 --> 01:09:06,635
2 or 3 times a year? We go as well.

1207
01:09:06,659 --> 01:09:08,865
That song you always sing.

1208
01:09:08,889 --> 01:09:12,500
- Sing, sing.
- Sing, sing.
