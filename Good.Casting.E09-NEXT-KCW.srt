How did it go? Did you get it done?

14
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:38,609
Did you blow your cover?

15
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,680
She realized I'm an agent.

16

To finish it before the deadline,

55
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:43,839
I haven't even been out

56

take other passengers with you too.

- I'm sorry.

66

but he won't stop calling.

67
00:09:45,069 --> 00:09:46,640
Do you still have
something left to say?

68
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:51,079
If you didn't pick up my call,
I was going to visit you in person.

You sure catch on quickly.

71
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:57,819
Did you arrive in Malaysia safely?

72
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:00,919
I just can't get used to their food,
so I couldn't go.

73
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:04,059
I thought I made myself clear.

74
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:07,130
If you take it easy at
the Malaysia branch for a few years,

75
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:08,929
I will bring you back
at the right moment.

76
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,360
Do you think I didn't see you...

77
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,669

78
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:14,870
What do you want?

79
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,039
Half of the money
you have stashed away.

80
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:23,610
I know everything about
your hidden accounts, anyway.

81
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:26,250
Give me your PIN.
Then I will leave quietly.

82
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:31,120
And I will clean up
these useless things for you.

83
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:34,120
You're asking too much
for a clean-up job though.

84
00:10:34,419 --> 00:10:36,419
If Pi Cheol Woong talks and so do I,

85
00:10:36,419 --> 00:10:38,559
it's you who will suffer
the most damage.

86
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:42,600
I'll think about it.

87
00:10:42,699 --> 00:10:45,100
I can't wait long.
I'll give you a day.

88
00:11:08,589 --> 00:11:10,120
Have a drink before we talk.

89
00:11:15,929 --> 00:11:17,130
I will...

90
00:11:18,299 --> 00:11:21,429
hear what discomforting things
you have to say before we drink.

91
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:26,010
I thought it would only leave
a small scar so I left it.

92
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:28,410
But there was pus inside.

93
00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:30,309
What should I do?

94
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:32,880
Pus should be squeezed out...

95
00:11:33,309 --> 00:11:34,579
so that it won't give off a stink.

96
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:37,850
It will hurt when you squeeze it,
but only then will it heal.

97
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:41,319
So you're asking me to
squeeze out the pus?

98
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:42,919
As I did three years ago?

99
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:46,530
If that's what you wanted to say,
you came to the wrong person.

100

You only got to where you are now

Climbing up might take long,

00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:58,870
but it only takes a second to fall,
you know.

103
00:12:00,339 --> 00:12:01,569
I can...

104
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:04,110
look after myself.

105
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:08,610
But it seems like you can't.

106
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:15,819
What if I tell you I know a way
to clean up the mess you have?

107
00:12:25,329 --> 00:12:28,900
I'll hand you a broom.
All you need to do is sweep with it.

108
00:12:29,439 --> 00:12:32,299
People wouldn't know how many
bugs you kill while sweeping.

Pi Cheol Woong was murdered.

168
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:09,900
Do you get the picture?

169
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,739
He activated the alarm
to cause a distraction,

170
00:19:12,739 --> 00:19:14,009
to kill Pi Cheol Woong.

171
00:19:14,009 --> 00:19:16,070
Mu Hyeok, check White Collar's van.

172
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:18,380
The rest of you, go through
the hospital's surveillance.

173
00:19:18,479 --> 00:19:21,209
Figure out White Collar's route.
Get to it.

174
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:22,679
Mu Hyeok.

175
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,650
You said Chief Seo is in his office.

176
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:27,620
Come with me.

177
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:31,060
Why are you looking for Chief Seo?

178
00:19:31,989 --> 00:19:34,290
He sent someone after me.

179
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:35,590
He was watching you?

180
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:38,300
- What for?
- I'd love to know too.

181
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,969
What this is about.

182
00:19:41,729 --> 00:19:43,739
Let's find the killer first.

183
00:19:43,969 --> 00:19:46,410
Chief Seo wanted to send
Pi Cheol Woong to the prosecutors.

184
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:47,540
I had him...

185
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,340
locked up in a closed ward
for a psych evaluation.

186
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,279
I might have to take the fall...

187
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:52,910
and lose my job over this.

188
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:55,249
Wait. He tried to send
Pi Cheol Woong to the prosecutors...

189
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:57,320
without a police investigation?

190
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,219
We can suspect him
after we catch the killer.

191
00:19:59,219 --> 00:20:00,290
There's no time.

192
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:02,150
How far did you follow the killer?

193
00:20:02,689 --> 00:20:03,989
To a laundry collection van.

194
00:20:07,459 --> 00:20:08,790
The laundry collection van.

195
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,630
It disappeared in
the underground parking lot.

196
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:11,959
What do you mean?

197
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,499
We have it on camera
entering the parking lot.

198
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,269
But I just can't find it leaving.

199
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:22,509
Did it disappear into
thin air or what?

200
00:20:22,509 --> 00:20:26,509
Even if it vanished into thin air,
it should've left a few crumbs.

201
00:20:26,509 --> 00:20:28,110
What time was the police called?

202
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:30,249
11:43 p.m.

203
00:20:30,419 --> 00:20:31,650
A police van...

204
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:34,019
coming and leaving the scene
even before the call?

205
00:20:34,019 --> 00:20:35,489
That's impossible.

206
00:20:36,189 --> 00:20:38,860
It must've left
pretending to be police.

207
00:20:44,729 --> 00:20:48,070
A black van.
License plate number 16R 3419.

208
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:50,769
It left the hospital
at around 11:40 p.m.

209
00:20:50,769 --> 00:20:51,900
Check nearby roads.

210
00:20:52,769 --> 00:20:55,570
I found it. A black van,
number 3419.

211
00:20:55,769 --> 00:20:57,009
Checking it's route.

212
00:20:57,209 --> 00:20:58,279
Did you run the license plate?

213
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,449
(Car Registration, Theft Report)

214
00:21:00,449 --> 00:21:01,910
Lee Gwang Hyeok, 58, male.

215
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:04,550
He reported the car stolen recently.

216
00:21:05,479 --> 00:21:06,890
Have you found it yet?

217
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:09,959
It took the Incheon Airport
Expressway 3.5 hours ago.

218
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:12,820
Incheon?

219
00:21:13,259 --> 00:21:14,830
Is he fleeing the country?

220
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:16,300
It looks like it.

221
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,259
He took the Yeongjong Bridge
three hours ago.

222
00:21:19,259 --> 00:21:20,269
(16R 3419)

223
00:21:20,269 --> 00:21:22,769
We're leaving now.
Regroup at the van.

224
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,979
Everyone, follow me.

225
00:21:33,479 --> 00:21:35,080
We have pressing business.

226
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:36,150
Let's go.

227
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,779
Didn't you hear me?

228
00:21:41,749 --> 00:21:45,290
As of this moment,
Dong Gwan Su is relieved from duty.

229
00:21:45,489 --> 00:21:47,529
- What?
- Relieved from duty?

230
00:21:47,529 --> 00:21:48,929
Then who will lead the team?

231
00:21:48,929 --> 00:21:51,100
What good is a ship
without a captain?

232
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:55,199
Right after the emergency meeting,
Industry Security Team 3...

233
00:21:56,169 --> 00:21:57,239
will be disbanded.

234
00:21:57,239 --> 00:21:59,540
What are you talking about?

235
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,410
Is this what you wanted?

236
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,939
To break up our team?

237
00:22:02,939 --> 00:22:05,439
How can you say that
when you wasted time...

238
00:22:05,439 --> 00:22:06,509
and got our witness killed?

239
00:22:06,509 --> 00:22:08,610
Pi Cheol Woong was murdered
and made to look like suicide!

240
00:22:09,009 --> 00:22:10,949
We must catch the killer
before he gets away!

241
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:12,120
Yes.

242
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:14,650
The media will report
it was suicide,

243
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:16,419
but there was definitely a killer.

244
00:22:17,259 --> 00:22:18,320
Chief Tak.

245
00:22:19,989 --> 00:22:21,790
How did you find that out already?

246
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:24,300
He disappeared from the airport
instead of boarding his plane.

247
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,499
Where do you think he went?

248
00:22:26,669 --> 00:22:28,630
Fingerprints and footprints
found at the scene,

249
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:31,169
and the knots used to tie the rope
all point to Chief Tak!

250
00:22:31,169 --> 00:22:33,110
How can you be so decisive
without evidence...

251
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:34,969
The tools he used to
commit the crime...

252
00:22:34,969 --> 00:22:36,709
were found on his yacht!

253
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:49,650
What's wrong? What happened?

254
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:51,620
Our team is being disbanded.

255
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:53,160
What do you mean?

256
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:56,499
We won't be fired, will we?

257
00:23:00,999 --> 00:23:02,070
Chief Seo.

258
00:23:02,669 --> 00:23:04,199
Where is he right now?

259
00:23:04,199 --> 00:23:05,699
It's over already.

260
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:07,110
The chiefs will gather...

261
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:09,709
to discuss and vote on
breaking us up.

262
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:12,439
Chan Mi!

263
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,479
Industry Security Team 3...

264
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:26,759
Open the door!

265
00:23:27,229 --> 00:23:28,429
Don't mind her.

266
00:23:28,429 --> 00:23:30,999
I locked the door
knowing she'd do that.

267
00:23:30,999 --> 00:23:32,100
Let's begin.

268
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,469
Look.

269
00:23:42,209 --> 00:23:43,340
Are you crazy?

270
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:48,009
Did you just find out I'm crazy?

271
00:23:48,279 --> 00:23:49,479
What's the problem?

272
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:51,050
You had me tailed!

273
00:23:56,249 --> 00:23:57,320
Tell me.

274
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,660
Why did you have me followed?

275
00:24:00,729 --> 00:24:02,330
Why send an agent after me?

276
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:05,729
Do you want to...

277
00:24:07,229 --> 00:24:08,699
discuss that right now?

278
00:24:08,699 --> 00:24:09,729
Why not?

279
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,939
The cause for spying on
a subordinate...

280
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:14,040
doesn't have to be a secret.

281
00:24:14,669 --> 00:24:18,380
I sent a subordinate into the field
to carry out a mission,

282
00:24:18,979 --> 00:24:21,110
and she reunited with a student...

283
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:22,979
she once tutored and got distracted!

284
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:26,689
Yes. I had you watched.

285
00:24:33,459 --> 00:24:35,360
- That's...
- Wait.

286
00:24:38,699 --> 00:24:39,870
Yoon Seok Ho.

287
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,100
You knew him?

288
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:47,769
The great Baek Chan Mi...

289
00:24:48,009 --> 00:24:50,610
couldn't have forgotten the manual.

290
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:52,140
Did you...

291
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:56,279
act as a spy to betray your team?

292
00:24:58,150 --> 00:24:59,380
Just like three years ago?

293
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:05,090
Is it true?

294
00:25:05,459 --> 00:25:06,489
Did you break the rules...

295
00:25:06,489 --> 00:25:09,090
and monitor someone
you knew personally?

296
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,040
Mi Soon.

297
00:25:23,739 --> 00:25:26,340
Will we really be disbanded?

298
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:28,249
I don't know...

299
00:25:29,779 --> 00:25:31,479
what's going on anymore.

300
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,529
What do you mean?

301
00:25:46,529 --> 00:25:48,529
Chan Mi and Yoon Seok Ho.

302
00:25:48,929 --> 00:25:50,999
People are saying they used to date.

303
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,300
What?

304
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,679
Hang up.

305
00:26:09,959 --> 00:26:11,860
I'll say this just in case.

306
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:13,830
I didn't wait for you.

307
00:26:14,029 --> 00:26:15,660
You just happened to show up.

308
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:21,469
You wanted to punch Chief Seo
but got punched twice instead.

309
00:26:21,969 --> 00:26:23,900
That's why you should
control your temper.

310
00:26:24,239 --> 00:26:25,640
You do 99 percent perfectly,

311
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,870
then mess up the rest because of it.

312
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:31,340
You can nag only after
you quit smoking.

313
00:26:32,509 --> 00:26:33,550
This?

314
00:26:34,179 --> 00:26:36,249
It's not mine. I quit long ago.

315
00:26:37,479 --> 00:26:38,479
When?

316
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,290
Five years ago.

317
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,019
You quit smoking when you quit me.

318
00:26:46,459 --> 00:26:48,330
That's how disgusted you were.

319
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:49,830
After we broke up,

320
00:26:50,529 --> 00:26:53,229
I thought I'd really die
if I kept smoking at that rate.

321
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:55,529
That's why I quit.

322
00:27:00,939 --> 00:27:02,840
You knew it would be a problem.

323
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:05,709
Why did you take on Yoon Seok Ho?

324
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:22,529
That's all that I was told.

325
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:26,699
So he worked for Director Myeong
and handled the secret ledgers?

326
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,999
You can't trust anyone.

327
00:27:30,269 --> 00:27:33,140
He was persuaded by Director Myeong
that it's all for the company.

328
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:36,540
He felt so guilty that he confessed
to the Chairman for that reason.

329
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:40,179
The conclusion is that right before
Father passed away,

330
00:27:40,179 --> 00:27:42,350
he found out about
Director Myeong's ledgers.

331
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:45,979
And right after he argued with
Director Myeong about those ledgers,

332
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:47,519
he got into a car accident.

333
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:50,660
Those ledgers
will definitely contain...

334
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:52,120
the reason behind this.

335
00:27:54,989 --> 00:27:55,989
I...

336
00:27:58,229 --> 00:27:59,630
will bring those ledgers for you.

337
00:28:01,699 --> 00:28:02,929
You don't even know
where they are.

338
00:28:02,999 --> 00:28:05,370
They must be in his office...

339
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:07,209
where even ants can't break in.

340
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:11,979
Don't. It's dangerous.

341
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,410
Don't worry.

342
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:16,310
It's dangerous for Director Myeong,
not for me.

343
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,380
You can't even kill an ant.

344
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:20,449
I can't kill an innocent ant,

345
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:22,820
but I will punish the guilty.

346
00:28:27,529 --> 00:28:29,090
The Yoon Seok Ho that I know...

347
00:28:30,729 --> 00:28:32,729
isn't a bad kid.

348
00:28:36,229 --> 00:28:38,269
But if someone else watches him,

349
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,870
they would have had
a bias against him.

350
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:43,979
First, Yoon Seok Ho isn't a kid.

351
00:28:44,209 --> 00:28:46,679
Second, you're the one who's biased.

352
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,479
The bias that Yoon Seok Ho
would never do anything bad.

353
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:54,019
On what grounds? With what proof?

354
00:28:54,989 --> 00:28:57,219
If I were Chief Seo, I would've had
suspicions about you too.

355
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:59,259
And you're not suspicious of
Chief Seo?

356
00:29:00,529 --> 00:29:02,590
He even put an agent on me.

357
00:29:02,759 --> 00:29:05,100
If I were smart enough to insist
like a certain someone,

358
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,360
I would've stuck to my opinion.

359
00:29:08,199 --> 00:29:09,269
But you know me.

360
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,340
I'm in no place to do so.

361
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:07,160
(Lim Jung Eun,
Advertising Department)

362
00:30:17,609 --> 00:30:19,170
You must be looking for Ms. Lim.

363
00:30:19,769 --> 00:30:22,839
Did she not come to work today?

364
00:30:22,839 --> 00:30:24,849
That intern was gutsy enough
to take the day off.

365
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:27,779
I wonder who's
looking for her though.

366
00:30:31,089 --> 00:30:32,150
Goodness.

367
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:35,089
You're CEO Yoon's secretary.

368
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:39,029
So what brings you by?
Why are you looking for Ms. Lim?

369
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:40,900
May I ask you that?

370
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,829
I had a work-related question.
I'll get going then.

371
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:12,460
Good morning, Mr. Yoon.

372
00:31:13,289 --> 00:31:14,559
It's not a good morning for me.

373
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:16,660
I had a rough night...

374
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:18,970
because my secretary disappeared
at Busan Port.

375
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:22,339
I'm truly sorry about that.

376
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:25,339
I looked for you frantically...

377
00:31:25,339 --> 00:31:27,440
since I thought
you might have been abducted.

378
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,509
Unbelievable.

379
00:31:30,039 --> 00:31:31,109
No way.

380
00:31:31,349 --> 00:31:32,809
Who would want to kidnap me?

381
00:31:32,809 --> 00:31:35,720
You couldn't even bother to call.
All I received was a text...

382
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,049
saying you were heading home.

383
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:39,549
Well...

384
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,789
I had urgent business
to take care of.

385
00:31:44,019 --> 00:31:45,460
You were urgent enough...

386
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:46,890
to abandon your own boss?

387
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:48,430
That's ridiculous.

388
00:31:48,859 --> 00:31:50,730
I never abandoned you.

389
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:51,829
What would you call it then?

390
00:31:51,829 --> 00:31:54,069
I just entrusted someone else...

391
00:31:54,069 --> 00:31:56,900
and handed over my duties
to the hired driver for a while.

392
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,480
Is that so?

393
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,549
So you dumped me with him.

394
00:32:05,809 --> 00:32:09,319
I understand that
my actions could be misinterpreted.

395
00:32:11,289 --> 00:32:13,589
She handed me over. Seriously.

396
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:19,029
I should've escorted you
all the way back home.

397
00:32:19,029 --> 00:32:22,099
I'll make sure that
it never happens again.

398
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:35,140
I'm glad
you weren't hurt in any way.

399
00:32:36,009 --> 00:32:38,079
- Sorry?
- You see,

400
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,450
I was worried about your safety.

401
00:32:41,619 --> 00:32:43,349
This is me getting back at you
for scaring me.

402
00:32:47,349 --> 00:32:49,960
Anyway, let's make sure...

403
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:52,730
that Mr. Byun
never finds out what happened.

404
00:32:54,299 --> 00:32:55,359
Anyway, wait 10 seconds
before coming in.

405
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:12,049
1, 2, 3...

406
00:33:13,009 --> 00:33:14,619
Right, of course.

407
00:33:14,819 --> 00:33:15,849
Good morning.

408
00:33:16,049 --> 00:33:19,150
Thank you, thank you.

409
00:33:19,349 --> 00:33:20,990
Thanks for the coffee.

410
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:23,420
I'll call you back later. Sure.

411
00:33:24,789 --> 00:33:26,690
Gosh, that's good.

its recipients good luck...)

in 4 days.)

415
00:33:40,069 --> 00:33:41,809
(Read the letter with good music)

416
00:33:41,809 --> 00:33:44,250
This is to announce
the end of your mission.

417
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:46,349
At midnight tonight,

418
00:33:46,349 --> 00:33:48,549
your mission will come to an end.

419
00:33:48,549 --> 00:33:52,289
You are not to carry out
any more related operations.

If your identity
is exposed after midnight,

421

the agency
will deny your affiliation.

422
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:00,759
You have been advised...

423
00:34:00,759 --> 00:34:03,859
to leave your post
before the mission ends.

424
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,500
This message will now delete itself.

425

What's putting a frown on your face?

426
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,539
It's spam.

427
00:34:12,539 --> 00:34:15,210
Do people still send out
chain letters?

428
00:34:17,109 --> 00:34:20,450
Doesn't it feel a bit weird
not to send them out though?

Sorry?

431

I once didn't send out
any chain letters...

432
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:30,460
after receiving them.

433
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:32,559
I got injured in a car accident...

434
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:34,260
which put me in a cast.

435
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,559
I don't believe in superstitions.

436

It's just to be on the safe side.

What?

444
00:36:16,099 --> 00:36:18,269
But I definitely wrote it down.

445
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:22,699
I wrote down
detailed instructions...

446

00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,469
"If it weren't for you..."

496
00:39:38,469 --> 00:39:40,369
That's no good!

497
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,570
Hey, Ultra Fine Dust.
You haven't been in love, have you?

498
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:48,579
I'm not obliged to answer
such personal questions.

499
00:39:48,579 --> 00:39:51,349
You're saying goodbye
for the first and last time...

500
00:39:51,349 --> 00:39:55,250
to the person you love
before leaving him.

501
00:39:55,619 --> 00:39:56,619
Of course.

502
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,849
I must be stupid to expect
anything more...

503
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:00,690
from a relationship virgin like you.

504
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:12,199
"If it weren't for you,"

505
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:16,739
"I wouldn't have known
what love is."

506
00:40:16,969 --> 00:40:18,409
("The Love after Love")

507
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,780
"Thank you for teaching me
how it is to love someone..."

508
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:26,679
"and how it feels..."

509
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,150
"to be loved too."

510
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:48,670
Isn't it your turn?

511
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:53,670
"What a joke."

512
00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:56,739
Darn it. That's not right.

513
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:19,530
(How to use a rice cooker)

514
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:27,170
Mr. Yoon must be staying late
to finish the employee evaluations.

515
00:41:27,539 --> 00:41:29,880
I'll stay until he heads home,

516
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,909
so you can call it a night.

517
00:41:31,909 --> 00:41:33,010
What has gotten into you today?

518
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:34,780
It's not like you
to work late voluntarily.

519
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:37,949
Is it perhaps your last day here?

520
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:40,050
You should head home.

521
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:42,119
With pleasure.

522
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:46,960
All right then.
Tell him I left if he asks.

523
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:49,159
Mr. Byun.

524
00:41:49,659 --> 00:41:51,059
You've got to be kidding me.

525
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:53,570
Have you changed your mind already?

526
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:56,869
I apologize for always
getting off work on time.

527
00:41:56,869 --> 00:41:59,110
I'm grateful for everything too.

528
00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:00,210
What's going on?

529
00:42:01,809 --> 00:42:03,280
Don't tell me...

530
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,010
I'll head in tomorrow
and see your desk cleaned out.

531
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,050
That's good then.

532
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:11,590
Anyway, I'm off. See you tomorrow.

533
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:28,639
This is definitely
how he ironed my shirts.

534
00:42:31,269 --> 00:42:32,739
Darn you, Cheol Woong.

535
00:42:32,739 --> 00:42:34,809
Couldn't you have at least
found a replacement before leaving?

536
00:42:34,809 --> 00:42:35,940
Unbelievable.

537
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,880
(How to use a rice cooker)

538
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:46,949
Why does...

539
00:42:46,949 --> 00:42:49,059
she even want this silly note back?

540
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:52,789
Was it that hard
to come up with an excuse?

541
00:42:52,989 --> 00:42:54,960
Why couldn't she just apologize?

542
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,730
As if I'd believe...

543
00:42:57,730 --> 00:43:00,070
she really wanted
this lousy note back.

544
00:43:09,039 --> 00:43:10,480
I can't just give it back to her.

545
00:43:11,809 --> 00:43:14,309
This is my ticket
to boss her around a bit more.

546
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:17,949
Mr. Pi, the manager
of actor Kang Woo Won,

547
00:43:17,949 --> 00:43:20,019
was found dead.

548
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:21,719
Mr. Pi worked as...

549
00:43:21,719 --> 00:43:24,360
Kang Woo Won's manager
for several years.

550
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:27,289
An acquaintance of the deceased...

551
00:43:27,289 --> 00:43:30,260
stated that he was under
a lot of stress due to long hours...

552
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:32,500
and was devastated when Mr. Kang...

553
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:35,340
started to work
with another manager...

554
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:38,170
after becoming an A-lister.

555
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:41,610
The police announced
that they will focus on...

556
00:43:41,610 --> 00:43:43,739
Mr. Pi's depression
and the possibility of a suicide.

557
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:46,150
- Such news...
- Pi Cheol Woong...

558
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:48,949
- Many send their condolences.
- is dead?

559
00:43:55,789 --> 00:43:58,460
Anyone can tell
that it's Chan Mi and Mi Soon.

560
00:43:59,829 --> 00:44:00,889
Hold on.

561
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:07,329
I smell something funky though.

562
00:44:07,329 --> 00:44:09,400
You see,

563
00:44:09,699 --> 00:44:11,809
my daughter spilled some soup on it.

564
00:44:13,539 --> 00:44:14,570
Well,

565
00:44:15,139 --> 00:44:17,610
I'll have an expert look into
the physiological aspect of this,

566
00:44:18,039 --> 00:44:20,110
so keep me posted
on Kang Woo Won's condition.

567
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:22,280
How has he been lately?

568
00:44:22,949 --> 00:44:24,050
He seems off.

569
00:44:24,849 --> 00:44:26,489
Has he remembered anything more?

570
00:44:26,489 --> 00:44:27,920
That's not it.

571
00:44:28,389 --> 00:44:29,389
Before,

572
00:44:30,090 --> 00:44:31,860
he used to glare at me like that.

573
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:32,889
But these days,

574
00:44:34,059 --> 00:44:35,500
he looks at me like this...

575
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,099
and calls me whenever he wants to.

576
00:44:37,099 --> 00:44:38,500
I'd go to him...

577
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:41,070
only to find out
he needed a silly favor.

578
00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:43,800
He'd then come up with an excuse
to keep me around.

579
00:44:45,610 --> 00:44:46,739
Ye Eun,

580
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:49,880
was So Hui's dad
the first man you dated?

581
00:44:50,539 --> 00:44:52,909
Yes. Why do you ask?

582
00:44:54,349 --> 00:44:56,980
The reason Kang Woo Won
is acting that way...

583
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:03,219
Forget it.

584
00:45:04,090 --> 00:45:05,889
Telling you...

585
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:08,699
will only mess with your head.

586
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:13,429
I hope his condition
isn't getting worse.

587
00:45:47,070 --> 00:45:49,670
If this was because
you didn't trust me,

588
00:45:50,739 --> 00:45:51,809
I must say I'm offended.

589
00:45:52,739 --> 00:45:53,739
You're offended?

590
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:57,980
You couldn't handle CEO Yoon,
so I had someone tail him.

591
00:45:58,409 --> 00:46:00,610
Why you felt the need
to complain is beyond me.

592
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:05,690
You put me in charge of everything
related to Il Kwang Hitech,

593
00:46:05,690 --> 00:46:06,719
so I would've...

594
00:46:06,719 --> 00:46:08,920
Baek Chan Mi and Yoon Seok Ho
knew each other in the past.

595
00:46:11,389 --> 00:46:14,489
Did you choose not to tell me
or did you not know about it?

596
00:46:17,630 --> 00:46:19,269
The latter proves
your incompetence...

597
00:46:19,269 --> 00:46:21,130
while the former...

598
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:24,239
disgusts me.

599
00:46:27,739 --> 00:46:31,679
I was going to report it soon.

600
00:46:40,349 --> 00:46:42,519
This is exactly why
I can't quit smoking.

601
00:46:43,159 --> 00:46:45,730
How else can I relieve the stress
brought on by my subordinates?

602
00:46:46,389 --> 00:46:47,730
What did you say to me again?

603
00:46:48,599 --> 00:46:49,659
You're offended?

604
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:53,070
I apologize.

605
00:46:53,070 --> 00:46:56,769
If this is how it'll be,
how am I supposed to trust you...

606
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:58,510
to do the job?

607
00:46:59,409 --> 00:47:03,179
How could I possibly
back you up on your promotion?

608
00:47:04,510 --> 00:47:05,650
Just how?

609
00:47:09,849 --> 00:47:10,920
Answer me.

610
00:47:12,619 --> 00:47:13,690
I'll...

611
00:47:15,219 --> 00:47:16,360
do better.

612
00:47:19,230 --> 00:47:20,329
You may leave.

613
00:47:24,599 --> 00:47:26,869
Don't get caught on camera
taking the elevator...

614
00:47:26,869 --> 00:47:28,269
and take the stairs instead.

615
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:31,239
I'm sure I didn't
have to tell you that.

616
00:47:32,510 --> 00:47:34,139
You are the director
of the NIS after all.

617
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:53,530
How dare she talks like
I'm beneath her...

618
00:47:53,530 --> 00:47:54,860
when she's way younger than me?

619
00:47:59,829 --> 00:48:01,599
Oh, my knees.

620
00:48:08,739 --> 00:48:09,840
Are you heading home?

621
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:13,480
I was here working late,
but my own secretary...

622
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:14,909
didn't bring me anything to eat.

623
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:18,380
I'm heading out to grab a bite.

624
00:48:18,489 --> 00:48:19,619
I'm sorry, sir.

625
00:48:19,889 --> 00:48:22,360
Should I make reservations
at a nearby restaurant?

626
00:48:22,659 --> 00:48:24,389
Or I'll run out
and get some take-out.

627
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:25,590
Join me.

628
00:48:26,630 --> 00:48:29,000
- Sorry?
- You haven't had dinner either.

629
00:48:32,070 --> 00:48:33,130
Then...

630
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,469
please buy me something delicious.

631
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:42,239
Enjoy. I'm only buying
because I'm grateful.

632
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:50,119
I don't think
I've been of much help though.

633
00:48:50,250 --> 00:48:52,250
You kept me company on November 17.

634
00:48:53,619 --> 00:48:57,460
Anyone would've been
able to do that.

635
00:48:59,829 --> 00:49:01,260
Keeping me company...

636
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:03,530
is a huge deal to me.

637
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,400
Everyone precious in my life
left me, you see.

638
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:15,139
All of them.

639
00:49:25,489 --> 00:49:29,789
(15 years ago)

640
00:49:32,789 --> 00:49:35,599
I won't stay for long.
I just want to see him.

641
00:49:36,929 --> 00:49:38,159
You signed a contract...

642
00:49:38,159 --> 00:49:41,070
that states once it expires,
you are no longer

643
00:49:41,070 --> 00:49:42,300
permitted to see him in private.

644
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:43,800
I want to see him as a friend,

645
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,570
not as someone I once taught.

646
00:49:46,139 --> 00:49:48,309
That's why we cannot allow it.

647
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:49,440
Please leave.

648
00:49:55,250 --> 00:49:57,349
(Seok Ho)

649
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:01,280
You know how it is with people.

650
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:05,179
There are encounters
but also farewells.

651
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:13,489
My mother died in her sickbed...

652
00:51:14,489 --> 00:51:17,329
and my father passed away
without a warning.

653
00:51:18,969 --> 00:51:20,030
And...

654
00:51:20,829 --> 00:51:22,599
the person I trusted the most...

655
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:26,039
also left me.

656
00:51:37,250 --> 00:51:38,349
Ms. Baek,

657
00:51:39,650 --> 00:51:42,489
I hope you never
disappear from my life.

658
00:51:43,690 --> 00:51:47,030
But my contract is only temporary.

659
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:50,599
I hope you never leave me.

660
00:51:59,070 --> 00:52:01,639
You're all doing
a good job as always.

661
00:52:01,639 --> 00:52:04,340
Mr. Byun, you shouldn't have.

662
00:52:04,610 --> 00:52:06,750
- Gosh.
- You're the only one...

663
00:52:06,750 --> 00:52:08,409
who looks out for us.

664
00:52:09,179 --> 00:52:12,119
Is that his sarcastic way
of telling me to visit often?

665
00:52:12,190 --> 00:52:14,219
Well, you should.

666
00:52:14,219 --> 00:52:15,860
It's not like we can
go to you upstairs.

667
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:17,489
You have to come down to us.

668
00:52:17,489 --> 00:52:19,530
Sure thing. I'll come by...

669
00:52:19,530 --> 00:52:21,889
when I receive my salary
next month too.

670
00:52:21,889 --> 00:52:23,230
I love you.

671
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,500
- Let's eat then.
- Enjoy.

672
00:52:25,699 --> 00:52:27,630
What do we have here?

673
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,599
Let's eat. My gosh.

674
00:52:30,599 --> 00:52:32,510
Trotters, pizza,

675
00:52:32,510 --> 00:52:34,539
fried chicken, and more.

676
00:52:34,539 --> 00:52:35,980
(Director's Office)

677
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:37,110
Aren't you joining us?

678
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:39,809
Don't mind me. I already ate.

679
00:52:39,809 --> 00:52:42,150
Then hand out the cups...

680
00:52:42,150 --> 00:52:44,480
and pour the guys some soda...

681
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:45,519
instead of just standing there.

682
00:52:45,519 --> 00:52:47,219
All right, fine.

683
00:52:47,219 --> 00:52:50,019
- Please enjoy.
- Let's eat!

684
00:52:53,130 --> 00:52:54,829
(Caller ID restricted)

685
00:52:57,130 --> 00:52:58,260
Is it the spam call again?

686
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:01,329
I told you to block that number.

687
00:53:04,039 --> 00:53:05,039
Hello?

688
00:53:06,969 --> 00:53:10,340
I'll hang up the second you put
a trace on the call, so just listen.

689
00:53:12,579 --> 00:53:13,880
Will you excuse me?

690
00:53:21,019 --> 00:53:24,360
I can't believe how many
executives are working late.

691
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:25,889
What do you expect?

692
00:53:26,289 --> 00:53:27,960
They're practically
temp workers, right?

693
00:53:28,159 --> 00:53:30,329
They must work extra hours
just to keep their jobs.

694
00:53:30,699 --> 00:53:32,130
- Right?
- Of course.

695
00:53:33,070 --> 00:53:34,699
Director Myeong's office
is empty though.

696
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,539
That's how it is with him.

697
00:53:36,539 --> 00:53:38,070
He comes to work
three hours earlier than others...

698
00:53:38,099 --> 00:53:39,170
but gets off right on time.

699
00:53:41,170 --> 00:53:42,840
His secretary must be exhausted...

700
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:44,440
to get to work before he does.

701
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:45,579
Why?

702
00:53:45,710 --> 00:53:47,650
The man handles
his documents personally...

703
00:53:47,650 --> 00:53:49,449
and his door
opens for him automatically.

704
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:50,980
Automatically?

705
00:53:53,889 --> 00:53:54,889
Let me show you.

706
00:53:56,119 --> 00:53:58,260
Look at the door to his office.

707
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:01,360
There's no security lock on it.

708
00:54:03,030 --> 00:54:04,900
How do you open it then?

709
00:54:06,170 --> 00:54:07,269
How should I know?

710
00:54:07,269 --> 00:54:09,170
There must be a way.

711
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:11,500
A key or a keycard.

712
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:12,969
Let's see.

713
00:54:14,210 --> 00:54:15,610
(Director's Office)

714
00:54:16,639 --> 00:54:18,139
Look.

715
00:54:18,139 --> 00:54:19,880
Open sesame!

716
00:54:22,449 --> 00:54:24,119
That's fascinating.

717
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,019
No one will be able to go in there.

718
00:54:28,119 --> 00:54:30,460
There's only one person who can.

719
00:54:31,889 --> 00:54:32,929
And who's that?

720
00:54:34,630 --> 00:54:35,730
Tak Sang Gi?

721
00:54:36,059 --> 00:54:37,929
I know you work for the NIS,

722
00:54:38,030 --> 00:54:39,800
so why do you think
I didn't tell Director Myeong?

723
00:54:40,570 --> 00:54:41,730
Why's that?

724
00:54:42,139 --> 00:54:44,440
I needed insurance
for a time like this.

725
00:54:46,110 --> 00:54:49,610
I'm sorry to tell you this,
but your insurance just expired.

726
00:54:49,610 --> 00:54:50,809
I'm aware.

727
00:54:51,010 --> 00:54:53,050
It's why I was hoping...

728
00:54:53,050 --> 00:54:56,050
to suggest a deal
between two abandoned parties.

729
00:54:56,050 --> 00:54:57,550
Show me your cards first...

730
00:54:57,820 --> 00:55:00,619
and then I'll decide
whether or not I'm in.

731
00:55:00,849 --> 00:55:02,219
You'll find it worth your while.

732
00:55:04,289 --> 00:55:07,030
You see, I saw something juicy...

733
00:55:07,059 --> 00:55:08,730
when I went to kill Pi Cheol Woong.

734
00:55:57,510 --> 00:55:59,010
You weren't the one who killed him?

735
00:56:00,110 --> 00:56:02,519
See for yourself
if you can't believe me.

736
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:13,230
Name your price.

737
00:56:15,130 --> 00:56:17,960
Wait, how did she get in there?

738
00:56:18,429 --> 00:56:21,230
She's an outside hire
who comes once a week.

739
00:56:21,230 --> 00:56:23,699
Director Myeong
hired her in person.

740
00:56:23,699 --> 00:56:26,210
Only she would know
how to get in there.

741
00:56:26,809 --> 00:56:30,610
Why are you curious
about how to access his door though?

742
00:56:35,579 --> 00:56:38,250
Well, I'm seriously considering...

743
00:56:38,250 --> 00:56:40,750
installing the same system
for CEO Yoon.

744
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:42,420
I see.

745
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:47,230
Can I see her access the door
on another day?

746
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:50,500
Why? What for?

747
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:53,070
Well, I need to see if the system...

748
00:56:53,070 --> 00:56:55,030
works properly.

749
00:56:55,269 --> 00:56:56,570
- Just to check?
- Yes.

750
00:56:58,269 --> 00:57:00,210
Sure, let's take a look.

751
00:57:01,570 --> 00:57:04,079
(Director's Office)

752
00:57:07,110 --> 00:57:08,949
Wait, the door isn't opening.

753
00:57:08,949 --> 00:57:10,679
- Why not?
- It's not opening.

754
00:57:10,679 --> 00:57:11,980
Was it out of order?

755
00:57:14,250 --> 00:57:16,690
Freeze. Take it back a few frames.

756
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:30,670
Director Myeong's ledger.

757
00:57:31,699 --> 00:57:32,710
His ledger?

758
00:57:33,909 --> 00:57:36,210
The one he has in his safe.

759
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:37,510
Bring it to me.

760
00:57:37,610 --> 00:57:39,650
My mission at Il Kwang Hitech
ends tonight,

761
00:57:40,250 --> 00:57:41,679
so how am I supposed to get it?

762
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:45,179
That's for you to figure out.

763
00:57:45,550 --> 00:57:47,420
Don't you want to catch Michael?

764
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:50,320
Michael?

765
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:06,469
Are you saying...

766
00:58:07,809 --> 00:58:09,039
that Michael is the killer?

767
00:58:10,510 --> 00:58:13,349
He said so
before he killed Pi Cheol Woong.

768
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:15,210
Do you know
what's more interesting though?

769
00:58:15,579 --> 00:58:16,880
He's around you.

770
00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:19,150
Somewhere close.

771
00:58:19,989 --> 00:58:21,119
What do you mean...

772
00:58:21,789 --> 00:58:23,059
he's someone around me?

773
00:58:24,219 --> 00:58:26,159
Get me the ledger
if you wish to know.

774
00:58:26,159 --> 00:58:27,289
I'll be in touch.

775
00:58:27,889 --> 00:58:28,929
Hold on.

776
00:58:35,769 --> 00:58:36,840
And here I thought...

777
00:58:37,139 --> 00:58:39,969
you had run off like last time.

778
00:58:41,739 --> 00:58:43,380
I received an urgent call.

779
00:58:47,510 --> 00:58:48,980
You seem pale.

780
00:58:50,150 --> 00:58:51,349
I'm all right.

781
00:58:53,949 --> 00:58:56,460
The ramyeon has gotten
cold and mushy.

782
00:58:56,460 --> 00:58:57,690
Let's enjoy it again
some other time.

783
00:59:05,969 --> 00:59:08,670
First, Yoon Seok Ho isn't a kid.

784
00:59:08,869 --> 00:59:11,300
Second, you're the one who's biased.

785
00:59:11,670 --> 00:59:14,139
The bias that Yoon Seok Ho
would never do anything bad.

786
00:59:15,369 --> 00:59:17,639
On what grounds? With what proof?

787
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:35,360
(Crazy Baek Chan Mi)

788
00:59:35,429 --> 00:59:37,460
I'm outside your house.
Get down here.

789
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,530
If you don't, I'll barge right in.

790
01:00:13,530 --> 01:00:16,000
Fine, I'm coming!

791
01:00:30,579 --> 01:00:33,420
She's unbelievable!

792
01:00:35,219 --> 01:00:36,289
Hold on.

793
01:00:36,889 --> 01:00:38,190
Where is she going at this hour?

794
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:51,969
(Wash and Clean)

795
01:00:54,269 --> 01:00:55,340
Are you insane?

796
01:00:55,340 --> 01:00:57,110
You can't drop by where I live.

797
01:00:59,010 --> 01:01:00,010
What?

798
01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:02,449
What's going on?

799
01:01:11,590 --> 01:01:13,429
Tak Sang Gi contacted me.

800
01:01:13,429 --> 01:01:14,730
What did the jerk want?

801
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:16,159
A deal on his prison sentence?

802
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:17,900
Is he smuggling himself
out of the country?

803
01:01:18,929 --> 01:01:20,130
Tak Sang Gi...

804
01:01:20,869 --> 01:01:24,269
has a video of Michael
killing Pi Cheol Woong.

805
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:27,269
Are you saying that
Michael killed Pi Cheol Woong?

806
01:01:27,269 --> 01:01:30,480
Tak Sang Gi suggested a deal.

807
01:01:33,110 --> 01:01:35,010
It seems like
Director Myeong has a ledger.

808
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:37,050
If I bring it to him,

809
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:39,920
he'll hand over the video.

810
01:01:41,719 --> 01:01:42,820
Come on.

811
01:01:43,489 --> 01:01:45,260
Are you trusting
the words of a killer?

812
01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:46,289
What if...

813
01:01:47,190 --> 01:01:48,260
he's telling the truth?

814
01:01:50,329 --> 01:01:52,670
What if
Michael killed Pi Cheol Woong...

815
01:01:53,070 --> 01:01:54,570
and had our team dismantled?

816
01:01:55,099 --> 01:01:56,099
Hold on.

817
01:01:57,170 --> 01:01:58,369
Do you mean...

818
01:01:59,710 --> 01:02:03,380
that we're the final target
of whoever's behind this?

819
01:02:03,710 --> 01:02:06,980
Don't tell me you're
suspicious of Chief Seo.

820
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:08,280
What I have aren't suspicions.

821
01:02:09,349 --> 01:02:10,579
I'm sure of it.

822
01:02:50,219 --> 01:02:51,690
Agent Baek...

823
01:02:53,559 --> 01:02:54,559
will steal...

824
01:02:56,730 --> 01:02:58,300
the ledger tomorrow.

825
01:03:27,590 --> 01:03:29,400
(Good Casting)

826
01:03:29,630 --> 01:03:31,199
You'll steal
what's in Director Myeong's office?

827
01:03:31,199 --> 01:03:33,500
We need to get our hands
on his sensor.

828
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:35,030
You must return all the equipment.

829
01:03:35,030 --> 01:03:37,269
We have no choice
but to do it old-school.

830
01:03:37,269 --> 01:03:38,840
- Okay.
- The target is en route.

831
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:40,510
If I knew you weren't
some ordinary secretary,

832
01:03:40,510 --> 01:03:41,940
I would've gotten rid of you sooner.

833
01:03:41,940 --> 01:03:43,139
We're just getting started.

834
01:03:43,139 --> 01:03:44,539
Kang Woo Won is on
a downward spiral.

835
01:03:44,539 --> 01:03:45,579
Mr. Kang!

836
01:03:45,579 --> 01:03:47,710
- I'm on my way.
- That nutjob.

837
01:03:47,809 --> 01:03:49,750
- You have three minutes.
- Start up the backup generators.

838
01:03:49,750 --> 01:03:52,349
The security team is here.
Get out of there. Hurry!

839
01:03:54,849 --> 01:03:57,119
My assistant stole from
Director Myeong's office?

840
01:03:59,730 --> 01:04:01,630
(Epilogue)

841
01:04:06,369 --> 01:04:08,469
(NIS Chief Seo Gook Hwan)

842
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:28,989
Who uses a flip phone these days?

843
01:04:58,250 --> 01:05:00,349
(Agent Dossier)

844
01:05:06,630 --> 01:05:08,159
(Baek Chan Mi)

845
01:05:11,199 --> 01:05:13,570
(Hwang Mi Soon)

846
01:05:16,269 --> 01:05:18,199
(Lim Ye Eun)

847
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:22,269
(Lim Ye Eun and Kwon Min Seok
were in a relationship.)

848
01:05:22,269 --> 01:05:24,780
(Kwon Min Seok died
the day their daughter was born.)

849
01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:25,940
Kwon Min Seok?
