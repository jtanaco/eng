1
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:10,410
(Episode 35)

2
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:14,849
His bronchial tubes
are quite constricted.

3
00:00:15,009 --> 00:00:17,626
Oxygen saturation is low after
suffering from respiratory distress,

4
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:19,380
so he'll need some oxygen.

5
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,919
How long has this been going on?
My guess is several days.

6
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:24,890
I'm not sure.

7
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,059
When did it start happening?

8
00:00:27,489 --> 00:00:29,236
His breathing was fine...

9
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:32,730
and he didn't have a fever
when I stopped by the workshop.

10
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:36,000
Right, he was fine back then.

11
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:41,340
I think it started after
his field trip three days ago.

12
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:44,640
I figured the fever
was due to a cold.

13
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:49,149
Bacterial pneumonia
can come along with a fever.

14
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:52,149
We'll check his blood
and X-ray tomorrow...

15
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,990
and give him antibiotics
as well as oxygen.

16
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:02,130
He had pneumonia, but
all I gave him was cold medicine.

17
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:04,875
Moms aren't supposed
to be medical experts.

18
00:01:04,899 --> 00:01:06,560
Don't beat yourself up over it.

19
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:11,369
I'll get going then.

20
00:01:11,869 --> 00:01:13,469
Sure. Thanks for everything.

21
00:01:15,569 --> 00:01:19,280
Bo Young, have a seat.
I don't want you to pass out.

22
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:25,150
Are you done in there?

23
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,420
How's your patient?

24
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:29,750
He's okay.

25
00:01:30,349 --> 00:01:32,665
Were you with Dr. Yoon
this evening though?

26
00:01:32,689 --> 00:01:34,459
How so?

27
00:01:35,989 --> 00:01:37,430
We went for some drinks.

28
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,329
So the patient's mother...

29
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,730
They used to go to the same church.
She's his first love.

30
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:48,616
What about the boy's father?

31
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,010
I'm guessing she's a single mom.

32
00:01:50,609 --> 00:01:53,040
What a dramatic reunion, right?

33
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:55,950
It is, but you're being
very nonchalant about it.

34
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,980
You're saying it like
he's some friend.

35
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,920
It'd be odd to talk about him
like my ex-husband.

36
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:05,060
Anyway, we should get going.

37
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,459
Jae Seok.

38
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,530
Jae Seok!

39
00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:12,599
Where on earth is he?

40
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,199
Where did he go
without turning off the lights?

41
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,020
Maybe the convenience store?

42
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,639
Jae Seok!

43
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,210
What on earth?

44
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:25,586
What are you doing?

45
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:26,810
You're home.

46
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,580
Why are you cleaning at this hour?

47
00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:32,526
You never clean up
even when I ask you to.

48
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:35,650
Gyu Jin, I'm not cleaning right now.

49
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:39,566
I'm wiping my heart.

50
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,530
What are you talking about?

51
00:02:42,289 --> 00:02:44,336
Well, I'm not in the mood
to argue with you.

52
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,006
Leave and let me shower.

53
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,199
Go ahead.

54
00:02:47,259 --> 00:02:50,045
Stop joking around and leave!

55
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:51,945
Take your shower. I won't watch.

56
00:02:51,969 --> 00:02:54,300
Why do you never listen?

57
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:56,740
Gyu Jin,

58
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,909
I'm experiencing a crisis right now,

59
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:01,080
so please let me be.

60
00:03:05,349 --> 00:03:06,879
What's going on?

61
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:29,210
Have you been cleaning all night?

62
00:03:29,669 --> 00:03:30,840
What's going on?

63
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,879
Jae Seok, you're scaring me!

64
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:45,490
Gyu Jin, I've come to a conclusion.

65
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:47,020
What do you mean?

66
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,159
I've been leading
too much of an honest life.

67
00:03:49,259 --> 00:03:50,566
Instead of going out with friends,

68
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,135
I've been trying hard
to adjust to my new workplace.

69
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,976
Work, home, work, home.

70
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,776
The lack of stimulants in my life
has made me lose it.

71
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,240
Honest life? No. Insane? Yes.

72
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,870
Out of sight, out of mind.

73
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:05,186
I'll go back
to my corrupt lifestyle.

74
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:06,816
I'll go back
to being the old Yoon Jae Seok,

75
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,449
so don't try to stop me.

76
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,325
Hui Jae, it's me.

77
00:04:13,349 --> 00:04:15,566
Let's meet up tonight.
Where? Secret Club.

78
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,425
I expect everyone to be there.

79
00:04:17,449 --> 00:04:20,295
Especially Chang Ryeol.
He'd better not look old today.

80
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:22,330
Today, we're picking up women.

81
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:26,430
See? I'll now wash up.

82
00:04:33,939 --> 00:04:36,839
What's gotten into him?
Has he lost his mind?

83
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,079
Jae Seok!

84
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,019
Did you clean the utility room too?

85
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:47,055
Gosh, look how shiny the floor is.

86
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:49,526
Just like I suspected,
it's bacterial pneumonia.

87
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:51,389
Thankfully, there's no
secondary infection.

88
00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:54,319
His fever is subsiding,
so don't worry too much.

89
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:57,206
I want constant updates
on his oxygen level and fever.

90
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,399
Got it.

91
00:04:58,459 --> 00:05:00,536
Si Hoo, how's your breathing?

92
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,800
It's good.

93
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,769
You'll keep getting better.

94
00:05:03,899 --> 00:05:06,276
By the way, it looks like
you've grown a bit taller.

95
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,240
I'd say about 3cm.

96
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,810
And you lost some weight.

97
00:05:11,069 --> 00:05:13,110
It's as if you've been trying to.

98
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:15,685
I haven't.
Does it seem that way though?

99
00:05:15,709 --> 00:05:18,009
Yes, you also have
bags under your eyes.

100
00:05:18,379 --> 00:05:20,696
My mom used to have them as well.

101
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,889
Si Hoo, please.

102
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,819
I see you're still
as honest as ever.

103
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,930
He's not like his mother at all.

104
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,600
I have bags under my eyes?

105
00:05:37,329 --> 00:05:38,970
Dr. Song.

106
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,115
What's wrong?
Do you have more questions?

107
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:43,910
No, that's not it.

108
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,716
Things were too hectic yesterday...

109
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,750
that I wasn't able
to thank you properly.

110
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,519
Thank you for treating my boy
so late at night.

111
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:57,550
Please don't mention it.
I was just doing my job.

112
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,560
Also,

113
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,129
please know that
I was petrified last night.

114
00:06:04,689 --> 00:06:08,375
Sense of relief washed over me
when I saw a familiar face.

115
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:10,199
I wasn't in my right mind.

116
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,175
So what I'm trying to say is that...

117
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,470
You don't have to
explain your actions like this.

118
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:19,615
I wanted to apologize
for making you uncomfortable.

119
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:21,410
Please don't.

120
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,550
This is actually
making me more uncomfortable.

121
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,050
Sure thing.

122
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:31,519
Then I won't from now on.

123
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:37,629
Sure. Good day, then.

124
00:06:47,069 --> 00:06:48,810
That was kind of annoying.

125
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:50,709
Unbelievable.

126
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:54,240
Why does it feel
like I've been sucker-punched?

127
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,680
Darn it.

128
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:02,790
She seemed
so apologetic at first, but...

129
00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:05,259
"Then I won't from now on."

130
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,930
That's one cunning cat.

131
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:13,560
Leave it to Gyu Jin
to fall for someone like that.

132
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:33,550
It was mycoplasma.

133
00:07:34,449 --> 00:07:35,449
What?

134
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:37,620
What Si Hoo has.

135
00:07:39,019 --> 00:07:41,435
His fever is down
and his breathing has stabilized.

136
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:44,730
I checked his nose for infections,
but the results came back negative.

137
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:48,730
I'll run some more tests
to rule out other suspicions I have.

138
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:52,040
Why are you telling me all this?

139
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,185
I thought you'd be worried.

140
00:07:55,209 --> 00:07:56,439
I'm not.

141
00:07:57,069 --> 00:07:59,439
Of course you do
what's best for the patient.

142
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,709
I always trust your judgement
as a doctor.

143
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,656
You must be chummy
with Si Hoo's mom.

144
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,326
You even have gone to her workshop.

145
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:12,896
Right, I did go there once.
Leathercraft is a lot of fun.

146
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,889
It clears your head.

147
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,105
How should I know...

148
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:19,289
when none of my friends
work at leathercraft workshops?

149
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,406
You have the hospital director
on your side instead.

150
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:25,129
Look at how sweet
Jeong Rok is on you.

151
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,576
- Is that so?
- Try to work it out with him.

152
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:31,209
He has a great personality,
and he's cool and attentive.

153
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:34,810
He sure is a catch.
Women adore men like him.

154
00:08:36,579 --> 00:08:38,125
I should wish you good luck too.

155
00:08:38,149 --> 00:08:40,755
Si Hoo's mom
seems to depend on you a lot.

156
00:08:40,779 --> 00:08:42,096
Also, she's your first love.

157
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,220
It's why I consider myself lucky.

158
00:08:44,419 --> 00:08:46,336
Men go head over heels
for someone like Bo Young.

159
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,166
- Exactly!
- Exactly.

160
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:49,389
Exactly.

161
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:52,600
We just don't work together.

162
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,700
Exactly.

163
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,855
My gosh. Ok Ja, stop!

164
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:12,856
Are you kidding me?

165
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,755
What now?

166
00:09:14,779 --> 00:09:17,966
What's wrong with you?
You space out and then get angry.

167
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,289
Can't you see
you're bringing down the mood?

168
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:22,230
Go home
if you're going to be like this.

169
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:25,429
I wasn't in the mood anyway,
so thanks.

170
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,830
I'll get going.

171
00:09:27,429 --> 00:09:29,129
What? Stop right there.

172
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:33,416
Why are you being so moody today?

173
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,745
Are you experiencing menopause?

174
00:09:34,769 --> 00:09:35,916
Seriously?

175
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:38,186
How can you say that
to an unmarried woman?

176
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:41,456
Then what's the matter?

177
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,879
Honey, knock some sense into her.

178
00:09:44,009 --> 00:09:46,596
Keep me out of it.
I'm scared of her these days.

179
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,679
Unbelievable.

180
00:09:48,649 --> 00:09:50,696
- Hello.
- Hi, Mr. Song.

181
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,796
Are you off to your dance class?

182
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,066
- Yes.
- That's right.

183
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:55,929
We have more free time
during the day than in the evening.

184
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:58,535
Also, dancing in the evening...

185
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:01,299
makes me crave late-night snacks
which doesn't help.

186
00:10:01,659 --> 00:10:04,875
We stopped by to ask
if anyone would like to join us.

187
00:10:04,899 --> 00:10:08,370
I'm glad you guys are here.
Can you take her with you?

188
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:12,980
Ok Ja, don't mope around
and enjoy some dancing instead.

189
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:15,216
No, I'm not going today.

190
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,456
Why not? You were always against
missing even one class.

191
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,155
But you love dance classes.

192
00:10:21,179 --> 00:10:23,419
I don't anymore.

193
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,860
Besides, I'm not
in the mood to dance today.

194
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:29,759
Ok Ja, don't be like that
and join us.

195
00:10:30,059 --> 00:10:33,299
I'll buy coffee on the way there.

196
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:34,535
Come on.

197
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:37,405
The more the merrier, right?

198
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:38,505
Also, she offered to buy coffee.

199
00:10:38,529 --> 00:10:41,570
- Come on!
- Let's go.

200
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:45,169
No wonder she's being criticized.

201
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:48,615
Anyway, this is supposed
to be a secret,

202
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:50,726
so you can't repeat this to anyone.

203
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:54,096
Oh, please. You know
I'm good at keeping secrets.

204
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,889
My lips are sealed,
so don't you worry.

205
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:02,759
Anyway, did you hear the news?
It's about Mr. Yang.

206
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:05,659
These days, he's been...

207
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:15,440
Hold on. Just a second.

208
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:18,909
Please watch your step.

209
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,080
Be careful.

210
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:25,556
I was fine walking here, you know.

211
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,895
It's not even that far.

212
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:28,456
But the weather's hot.

213
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,620
Why not save the sweat
for the dance class alone?

214
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:33,389
You're right about that.

215
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:37,330
Be careful.

216
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,360
Hello, ladies.

217
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:42,529
Please watch your step.

218
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,269
That's what I was just about to say.

219
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,145
Just to win over Ms. Kang's heart,

220
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:52,985
he's been wearing a leather jacket
and riding a motorcycle...

221
00:11:53,009 --> 00:11:54,940
in this warm weather.

222
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,350
I can't believe it.

223
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:00,149
Incredible, isn't it?

224
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:05,720
Who knew that the manly Mr. Yang
would pine over a woman like this?

225
00:12:06,419 --> 00:12:07,990
Unbelievable.

226
00:12:11,259 --> 00:12:14,275
Cha-cha, spin, 1, 2.

227
00:12:14,299 --> 00:12:15,706
Cha-cha-cha.

228
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:19,476
Good. After a five-minute break,
we'll move onto the next sequence.

229
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,200
- Sure.
- Got it.

230
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,210
Ms. Kang, you're sweating.

231
00:12:24,269 --> 00:12:25,840
Yes, it has gotten warm.

232
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:29,309
My goodness, look at you sweating.

233
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,220
No, look at him sweating.

234
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:35,419
Gosh.

235
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,950
He's treating her like a princess.

236
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:41,035
It's as if she's a fragile being...

237
00:12:41,059 --> 00:12:42,590
who needs constant protection.

238
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:44,759
It's disgusting if you ask me.

239
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:47,076
How hilarious.

240
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,700
Ms. Kang, just a second.
Could you come this way?

241
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:55,470
Ms. Jang, can you step aside?

242
00:12:55,769 --> 00:12:57,210
What...

243
00:12:58,169 --> 00:13:01,056
How is it?
Isn't it the best spot here?

244
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,580
You're right. It is the best spot.

245
00:13:04,549 --> 00:13:06,879
- Gosh, that's good.
- Let me feel the breeze too.

246
00:13:08,149 --> 00:13:09,490
It's as if I'm in Antarctica.

247
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,690
Conserve electricity, you fools.

248
00:13:14,889 --> 00:13:16,466
- What?
- What's wrong with her?

249
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:17,535
Where is she going?

250
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:19,659
Ok Ja, are you leaving?

251
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:22,629
I used to work at Peanut Air.

252
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:26,515
Two years as a flight attendant
and a year working the desk.

253
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:28,840
And I'm qualified to perform CPR.

254
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:33,379
You seem over-qualified
to work the desk at our gym.

255
00:13:34,179 --> 00:13:36,750
I always wanted to work someplace
that needed my service...

256
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,155
and I just knew it
when I saw the job description.

257
00:13:40,179 --> 00:13:42,796
This place would definitely need me.

258
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,120
You're good with your words too.

259
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,296
I can start tomorrow
if you want me to.

260
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,765
Mornings or afternoons...

261
00:13:48,789 --> 00:13:51,336
You're on the older side though.

262
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,375
(Resume: Song Ga Hee)

263
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:53,700
You're 38.

264
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:58,446
You didn't notice though, right?

265
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,046
As you can see,
I've been maintaining...

266
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:01,440
my young looks and physique.

267
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,409
You have a son too.

268
00:14:08,309 --> 00:14:09,309
Yes.

269
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:13,580
(Fitness Center, Crossfit)

270
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:18,220
Those with children
tend to have family emergencies.

271
00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:19,419
I'm sorry.

272
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:21,690
Darn.

273
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:24,590
If you're that sorry, just hire me.

274
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,576
What should a woman
on the older side with a child do...

275
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,299
after her career is cut off then?

276
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,785
Bow to the teacher.

277
00:14:39,809 --> 00:14:41,255
- See you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.

278
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,359
Enjoy the rest of your day.

279
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,395
How about a game of soccer
before going home?

280
00:14:49,419 --> 00:14:50,450
Soccer?

281
00:14:51,019 --> 00:14:52,759
But I wore sandals to school today.

282
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:01,000
Hey, nerd.

283
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,730
Let's swap shoes.

284
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,500
No.

285
00:15:05,129 --> 00:15:08,015
Don't be like that.
We'll swap again tomorrow.

286
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:11,139
I don't want to.
I know you won't give them back.

287
00:15:12,139 --> 00:15:15,086
I wouldn't keep them
even if you told me to.

288
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,580
They look cheap anyway.

289
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:18,125
- Fatherless jerk.
- What?

290
00:15:18,149 --> 00:15:20,196
Are you going to
come at me like last time?

291
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,726
It's not like
you can beat me anyway.

292
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,850
- You loser.
- Hey!

293
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:31,830
What just happened?

294
00:15:32,529 --> 00:15:33,559
They're fighting.

295
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,100
What's up with him?

296
00:15:39,769 --> 00:15:41,169
Hyo Sin!

297
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,740
Hey, is school already over?

298
00:15:44,409 --> 00:15:45,716
Why did you come here
instead of going home?

299
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:46,840
I wanted to see you.

300
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:49,149
- What happened to your face?
- I threw him.

301
00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:50,779
What?

302
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:52,620
I threw him over my shoulder.

303
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:55,350
Just like you taught me, wait.

304
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:59,466
I grabbed him here and here
and threw him over my shoulder.

305
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:00,860
It actually worked.

306
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:03,129
I got punched a few times too,
but I did well, right?

307
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:06,399
The kids in my class
were just as surprised.

308
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,005
So? You came all the way here
to tell me that?

309
00:16:10,029 --> 00:16:11,799
Yes. I did well, right?

310
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,539
You did.

311
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:21,539
He's the third tallest boy
in my class.

312
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:25,080
He's really heavy too,
but I didn't feel any of his weight.

313
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:28,419
The technique was perfect then.
You did well.

314
00:16:28,549 --> 00:16:29,649
Good job.

315
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,919
I'm going to keep working out,
you know.

316
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:35,360
Before you know it,
I'll be able to take him on fully.

317
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:39,029
You'll keep teaching me
until then, right?

318
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:41,100
I will.

319
00:16:41,259 --> 00:16:42,529
Teach him what?

320
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:46,070
Mom.

321
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,970
What did he teach...

322
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,269
My gosh.

323
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:52,070
What's with your face?

324
00:16:52,409 --> 00:16:55,586
Did you have a fight?
Why? Who did you fight with?

325
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:56,879
No.

326
00:16:57,909 --> 00:17:00,850
- The thing is...
- He got hurt exercising with me.

327
00:17:01,779 --> 00:17:02,990
Exercising?

328
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:06,620
What exercise did you do
to hurt him like this?

329
00:17:06,889 --> 00:17:09,990
We were doing judo.
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

330
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:12,329
Don't even apologize to me.

331
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,600
What do you think
you're doing to my son?

332
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:16,900
He doesn't like to exercise.

333
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:20,099
Why would you want to teach him
judo when he was doing just fine?

334
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,376
What's the reason?

335
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,910
Why are you yelling at him?

336
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,440
I asked him to teach me.

337
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,140
What?

338
00:17:28,309 --> 00:17:32,279
I wanted to learn judo,
so I asked him to teach me.

339
00:17:33,579 --> 00:17:34,920
Ji Hun, you...

340
00:17:35,549 --> 00:17:38,789
You've been coming home late
and going straight to bed.

341
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:40,859
Is it because you learned judo?

342
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,460
Why did you lie to me then?

343
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:46,200
- Because you wouldn't let me do it.
- Of course not.

344
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:48,850
Why would I let you do it
when you get hurt like this?

345
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:51,529
Don't do the judo thing ever again.

346
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,200
If you want to exercise,

347
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,785
I'll play badminton with you.

348
00:17:55,809 --> 00:17:58,440
- Let's go home.
- No. I'm doing this.

349
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:00,940
Ji Hun.

350
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:03,180
I really need it.

351
00:18:03,809 --> 00:18:06,180
And I want to learn it from Hyo Sin.

352
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,819
Why are you being like this?

353
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,866
What did you do to manipulate him?

354
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:14,420
Mom, please.

355
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:15,990
I want to do this.

356
00:18:16,089 --> 00:18:18,160
I've never gone
against you before.

357
00:18:18,259 --> 00:18:21,200
Please let me do
what I want this time.

358
00:18:21,329 --> 00:18:22,799
Please.

359
00:18:29,369 --> 00:18:30,569
Please.

360
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,809
Then just do exercise.

361
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,710
Safely.

362
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,450
And you.

363
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,420
Since I'm nine years older than you,
I'll drop the honorifics.

364
00:18:44,049 --> 00:18:47,519
I will kill you if you teach him
anything dangerous. Okay?

365
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:50,490
Let's go.

366
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:55,359
Bye.

367
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,970
She's scary when she's upset.

368
00:19:02,869 --> 00:19:04,440
I can tell she's a mom.

369
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:12,285
It's been only two days,
but I'm getting heat rashes already.

370
00:19:12,309 --> 00:19:13,426
Gosh, it's so hot.

371
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:17,650
My gosh, how pathetic.

372
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:22,235
- What?
- What are you trying to pull off...

373
00:19:22,259 --> 00:19:24,065
with the leather jacket
and motorbike at your age?

374
00:19:24,089 --> 00:19:26,376
What a sight you are!

375
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,676
I'm just doing the whole thing
because I like it.

376
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,900
Whatever.

377
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:32,799
I don't know.

378
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:36,509
At least I admit
that you have the guts.

379
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:39,255
You blocked the huge
garbage truck and said,

380
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:41,156
"I'm a man who likes her."

381
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,950
That was just embarrassing.

382
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:47,480
Hey, why would you be
embarrassed by love?

383
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,549
You are so old-fashioned.

384
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:54,265
So what did she say?
Does she like you too?

385
00:19:54,289 --> 00:19:57,259
She doesn't seem to hate me,
but she wouldn't give me a chance.

386
00:19:57,589 --> 00:19:59,706
I guess it will take me a long time
to make her mine.

387
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:02,676
Actually I knew
she wasn't easy to deal with.

388
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,275
They say beauty is
in the eye of the beholder.

389
00:20:05,299 --> 00:20:06,869
The old sayings are all true.

390
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:10,170
It's just mysterious.

391
00:20:10,569 --> 00:20:12,446
Why? What's wrong about her?

392
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:15,015
Fine. You're the romanticist
of Yongju Traditional Market.

393
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,579
I admit it.

394
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:19,819
Is that a compliment or an insult?

395
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:21,220
It's a compliment.

396
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:23,990
It's not easy to be blinded
by love at your age.

397
00:20:24,619 --> 00:20:27,460
Good luck. I'll do
what I can do to help you.

398
00:20:28,089 --> 00:20:29,136
Are you serious?

399
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,466
Will you really help me?

400
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:31,535
How? What will you do?

401
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:34,075
Don't act charming to me.
Just do it to her.

402
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:35,335
What will you do to help me?

403
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:36,406
Tell me.

404
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:38,500
- Stop it.
- Hey, wait.

405
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:40,745
This is your check card.

406
00:20:40,769 --> 00:20:42,845
It offers various benefits
of shopping.

407
00:20:42,869 --> 00:20:45,309
You can use the card right away.

408
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:46,755
Thank you.

409
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:49,255
And this is an eco-friendly bag.

410
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:51,079
It looks pretty.
Please try using it.

411
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,095
I have bags at home.

412
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,196
I don't need it.

413
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,595
My gosh. I needed a bag like this.

414
00:20:56,619 --> 00:20:57,849
I'll take it.

415
00:21:02,289 --> 00:21:04,765
No, I'll take it with me.

416
00:21:04,789 --> 00:21:07,230
You just said you don't need it.

417
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:09,476
Why don't you give it
to someone who needs it?

418
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,769
No. I need it too.

419
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:14,575
The clerk gave it to me
in the first place.

420
00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:16,710
And you said you don't need it.

421
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:18,946
Why are you being so childish?

422
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:21,180
Did you not know
I'm always childish?

423
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,755
You haven't changed
at all, by the way.

424
00:21:23,779 --> 00:21:26,396
You are such a freeloader.

425
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,856
That's so pathetic.

426
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,795
Excuse me.
I'll go get you one more bag.

427
00:21:30,819 --> 00:21:32,619
Either of you can take it first.

428
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:49,299
Gosh, she's so nasty.

429
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:52,509
She's just ill-tempered.

430
00:21:52,569 --> 00:21:55,279
That's why Na Hee couldn't
put up with her.

431
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,589
That sly wench.

432
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:07,059
She's so greedy, but she just
pretends to be generous.

433
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:10,660
We are just the worst enemies.

434
00:22:13,329 --> 00:22:14,329
Five.

435
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:15,660
Four.

436
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:16,970
Three.

437
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:18,130
Two.

438
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,839
One. Time's up.

439
00:22:22,539 --> 00:22:23,670
Darn it.

440
00:22:25,009 --> 00:22:26,740
Bye. See you tomorrow.

441
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:31,785
Hey, we have nothing to eat
at home. We should go to dinner.

442
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:32,880
Where are you going?

443
00:22:33,849 --> 00:22:36,795
Gyu Jin, I told you this morning.
I will live a life of debauchery.

444
00:22:36,819 --> 00:22:39,065
I will go astray tonight.
I'll come home late.

445
00:22:39,089 --> 00:22:40,589
Don't wait for me and sleep first.

446
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:43,829
Bam.

447
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,160
1, 2.

448
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,630
Has he lost his mind?
This is serious.

449
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:55,075
Gosh, should I go grocery shopping?

450
00:22:55,099 --> 00:22:56,440
Dr. Yoon.

451
00:22:56,539 --> 00:22:57,670
Hey, Si Hoo.

452
00:22:59,009 --> 00:23:00,755
Are you all right?
Can you move around like that?

453
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:01,756
Yes, I'm fine.

454
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,626
The nurse says his fever broke,

455
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:05,450
so he can go out.

456
00:23:05,579 --> 00:23:06,920
Really?

457
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:08,519
Let me see.

458
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:11,049
Gosh, it's cold.

459
00:23:11,549 --> 00:23:13,589
When did your fever break like that?

460
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:15,936
We were on our way to see you.

461
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,630
Me? Why?

462
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:21,000
Si Hoo wants to eat
packed dinner with you again.

463
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:22,869
You know I have an open hand.

464
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:27,470
I'm happy to join you.

465
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:30,240
Thanks to you, I'm getting
free dinner again.

466
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:33,309
(Mother)

467
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:35,210
Excuse me.

468
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:40,549
- Mom.
- You cold-hearted punk.

469
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:43,666
Do you not even care...

470
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:46,589
if I'm alive or dead?

471
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:48,059
Mom, are you drunk?

472
00:24:09,009 --> 00:24:10,150
Mom.

473
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:13,180
That heartless rascal.

474
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:17,119
I've raised him with all my heart.

475
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:23,466
Mom, get up.
I know you're not drunk.

476
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:25,230
I saw you looking
through the window.

477
00:24:29,569 --> 00:24:32,845
You should've said that sooner.
You sly punk.

478
00:24:32,869 --> 00:24:34,170
This is embarrassing.

479
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:38,886
How could you pretend
to be drunk to call your son?

480
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:40,809
I had no choice.

481
00:24:41,009 --> 00:24:43,686
Why did you not even call me
after leaving like that?

482
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:45,085
You silly rascal.

483
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:46,549
I was going to call you.

484
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:48,356
After you calm yourself down.

485
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:50,089
As if.

486
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:52,866
Do you even care about me?

487
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:54,920
Of course I do.

488
00:24:55,289 --> 00:24:57,235
I've been feeling bad for you.

489
00:24:57,259 --> 00:24:59,430
You're just saying that.

490
00:25:02,099 --> 00:25:03,606
Were you waiting for my call?

491
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:04,775
Sure.

492
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:07,269
I waited for you to come every day.

493
00:25:07,299 --> 00:25:11,009
I've been feeling so lonely
and empty waiting for your call.

494
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:13,839
I thought I've raised
my children for nothing.

495
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:19,750
Now I feel like I'm a terrible son.

496
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,680
Do you want me to stand there
holding up my hands?

497
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:24,990
Stop it.

498
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,819
Are you making fun of me?

499
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:31,460
I'm sorry, Mom.

500
00:25:32,329 --> 00:25:34,829
I should've let you see
your son live happily.

501
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:37,230
I know I'm not a good son.

502
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:40,599
Don't say that.
I don't want to hear it.

503
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:42,769
You didn't do anything wrong.

504
00:25:43,809 --> 00:25:45,539
You can start over.

505
00:25:46,039 --> 00:25:49,240
She wasn't right for you
to begin with.

506
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,710
When I went to the market
earlier today...

507
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,720
Forget it. It's nothing.

508
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:02,289
Mom, did you eat dinner?

509
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,190
Do you want me
to cook ramyeon for you?

510
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:11,369
This place is so cool
even on weekdays.

511
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:15,245
I know. It's a beautiful world.

512
00:26:15,269 --> 00:26:16,539
I was being silly.

513
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:19,755
Now that I'm here,
I don't think of her at all.

514
00:26:19,779 --> 00:26:22,116
Hey, what is he mumbling about?

515
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:23,686
I don't know. He's not
in his right mind.

516
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:26,126
He just called us out
all of a sudden.

517
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:28,319
Stop chattering away
and order more drinks.

518
00:26:28,549 --> 00:26:30,549
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

519
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:45,430
Do you need something, Mr. Yoon?

520
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,500
I...

521
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,109
I need another bottle of this.

522
00:26:57,509 --> 00:27:01,150
This is crazy.
I'm seeing things now.

523
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:04,396
Hey, look over at the DJ booth.
Aren't they having fun?

524
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:06,190
The booth? Where? Where?

525
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,569
What? You'll go up to her?

526
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,539
Hey.

527
00:27:35,319 --> 00:27:37,490
My gosh. What...

528
00:27:38,049 --> 00:27:39,589
What? You're giving up?

529
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:42,866
Yes. It's best to not even try
when you'll only get jilted.

530
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:45,759
Forget about it.
Let's just drink. Cheers!

531
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:52,069
How strange. This is so weird.

532
00:27:54,769 --> 00:27:57,616
Sorry. I wasn't feeling well,
so I left first.

533
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,940
Have fun without me.

534
00:27:59,369 --> 00:28:01,279
I'll call you soon. Bye.

535
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:06,680
This is really confusing.
What's wrong with me?

536
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,920
This has never happened to me.

537
00:28:09,789 --> 00:28:11,619
Oh? Mr. Yoon!

538
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:18,859
What's this? Is it
another apparition? It is.

539
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:23,369
What was that about, Mr. Yoon?
Why didn't you say hi?

540
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:25,970
It's real.

541
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:28,039
It's the real Song Da Hee.

542
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:29,200
What?

543
00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:32,485
You appeared all over the place,

544
00:28:32,509 --> 00:28:34,180
and now I finally see
the real thing.

545
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:37,609
This is just crazy.
This wasn't the plan.

546
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:39,609
What are you saying?

547
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:42,426
What's wrong? Do you feel unwell?

548
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:44,265
Yes. I feel unwell.

549
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:48,089
I'm so very, immensely,
disturbingly unwell.

550
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:06,740
Mom's such a drama queen.

551
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,279
Yes.

552
00:29:09,009 --> 00:29:11,880
I closed up, so come home
when you're done.

553
00:29:13,009 --> 00:29:17,390
Yes. Don't be too late. Bye.

554
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:40,980
Mother.

555
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:44,650
Hi. Did you...

556
00:29:45,349 --> 00:29:47,579
visit your mother?

557
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:50,220
Yes.

558
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:55,390
Okay. I see.

559
00:29:57,490 --> 00:29:59,430
I should get going.

560
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:02,930
Mother.

561
00:30:14,539 --> 00:30:16,240
Mother. I'm so sorry.

562
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:19,680
You were so nice to me.

563
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:24,420
Forget it.

564
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:28,890
Don't call me that now. We're...

565
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:31,490
no longer family.

566
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:36,359
I'm not yet able to...

567
00:30:37,329 --> 00:30:41,299
greet you brightly in the street
and ask after you.

568
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:44,269
I'm not yet ready to do that.

569
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,309
I should go.

570
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:56,619
Take care of yourself.

571
00:31:19,569 --> 00:31:21,980
This is nice.
The weather's perfect too.

572
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:26,255
For some reason today,
I managed to concentrate so well.

573
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:29,180
So I studied without even
going to the toilet...

574
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:31,319
when I heard the closing song.

575
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:33,049
You know, the library's
closing song.

576
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:36,805
The feeling of hearing that
before leaving to go home...

577
00:31:36,829 --> 00:31:40,130
That gave me quite a feeling of
accomplishment.

578
00:31:44,029 --> 00:31:46,430
Must you be like that?

579
00:31:47,269 --> 00:31:48,940
Yes. I like it over here.

580
00:31:49,099 --> 00:31:50,670
Don't mind me and keep talking.

581
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:55,710
You're acting
really weird today. Why...

582
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:57,849
Are you very tired?

583
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:02,926
Now that I say that,
you look a bit pale.

584
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:05,750
No, no, stop. Freeze.

585
00:32:08,289 --> 00:32:11,589
You stay over there. I stay here.

586
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:15,829
Don't cross that line, okay?

587
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,599
What? My gosh.

588
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:20,970
What line?

589
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,045
The line as in-laws.

590
00:32:23,069 --> 00:32:26,815
Ancestors said it's better to stay
away from your in-laws' and toilet.

591
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:28,980
We got too close.

592
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:31,755
From now on,
we should keep a distance.

593
00:32:31,779 --> 00:32:34,795
You're the one
who didn't keep a distance.

594
00:32:34,819 --> 00:32:36,696
You asked me to be
your fake girlfriend.

595
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,966
But... That's why
I'm showing remorse for that.

596
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:43,235
Why exactly are you showing remorse?

597
00:32:43,259 --> 00:32:45,206
Because I have my reasons!

598
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:49,799
You're actually the type to cling on
every word someone says.

599
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:52,400
It's because
you're suddenly being weird.

600
00:32:53,569 --> 00:32:54,940
Are you angry with me?

601
00:32:56,539 --> 00:32:58,569
Did I do something wrong?

602
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:04,750
Don't do that either!
That blank stare!

603
00:33:05,609 --> 00:33:07,519
Just don't do anything!

604
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:10,190
Why should I just do nothing?

605
00:33:11,019 --> 00:33:12,690
What's the matter?

606
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:17,990
What is wrong with you?
I said no crossing the line!

607
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,430
Hey, how dare you touch me?

608
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,599
It's your last warning.
Don't do that!

609
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:30,710
Hey, Mr. Yoon. You're leaving.
You're really leaving?

610
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,170
Mr. Yoon!

611
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,339
Mr. Yoon.

612
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:35,910
Mr. Yoon.

613
00:33:36,579 --> 00:33:38,656
I need to know what I did wrong...

614
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:41,150
if I'm to apologize or something.

615
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:42,727
Mr. Yoon!

616
00:33:42,751 --> 00:33:45,626
Don't follow me.
You didn't do anything wrong.

617
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:47,259
But you're angry.

618
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,490
You're angry with me right now.

619
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:53,160
I'm not angry.

620
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:22,789
I'm sorry.

621
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:26,159
I have a tendency to not
look to my side when I walk.

622
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:29,699
But that motorcyclist
was going a bit too fast.

623
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:38,670
Mr. Yoon.

624
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:40,610
Mr. Yoon?

625
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:47,150
I guess I lost.

626
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:49,719
What?

627
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,590
I lost.

628
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:00,599
To you.

629
00:35:06,969 --> 00:35:08,940
Aren't you hungry?
Shall we have udon?

630
00:35:20,349 --> 00:35:23,119
(Unnie's Kimbap)

631
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:42,000
I don't know, I don't know
Take all my candy, I don't know

632
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:45,170
Once you do that, I will

633
00:35:46,909 --> 00:35:50,179
Ms. Ok Ja. We're closed for the day.

634
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:52,409
I know.

635
00:35:52,849 --> 00:35:53,880
You know?

636
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,949
Do you have business with me?

637
00:35:57,719 --> 00:36:00,519
Shall we have a drink?

638
00:36:00,619 --> 00:36:01,619
A drink?

639
00:36:02,519 --> 00:36:05,929
It looks like you want to
have a drink.

640
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:08,876
I'm sorry, but I have
errands to run tomorrow.

641
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,230
I can't drink tonight.

642
00:36:10,829 --> 00:36:12,099
Just one glass.

643
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:14,869
I have something to say.

644
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:18,539
Okay, then. I can do that.

645
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:27,470

(Episode 36)

647
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:33,755
No, it's fine.

648
00:36:33,779 --> 00:36:35,779
I'm more accustomed
to pouring my own drinks.

649
00:36:36,519 --> 00:36:38,119
I love drinking alone, you see.

650
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:42,865
A few drinks to wrap up the day...

651
00:36:42,889 --> 00:36:44,659
leads to a good night's sleep.

652
00:36:45,089 --> 00:36:46,089
Here.

653
00:36:58,109 --> 00:36:59,139
So...

654
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:01,480
what did you want to say to me?

655
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:06,685
Earning my keep at an early age...

656
00:37:06,709 --> 00:37:08,249
made me quite perceptive.

657
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:12,249
I doubt you wanted to drink with me
to swap meaningless words.

658
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:15,120
What is it? You can tell me.

659
00:37:19,759 --> 00:37:22,536
Do you like Yang Chi Su?

660
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,759
Yang Chi Su?

661
00:37:25,499 --> 00:37:26,730
Oh, you mean Mr. Yang.

662
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:30,576
So that's his name. I like it.

663
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:33,910
Answer my question. Do you like him?

664
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,679
I don't know why
I need to answer that.

665
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:40,910
Don't even think about
getting out of this.

666
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:44,449
You don't intend to
accept his feelings.

667
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:46,119
So what?

668
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:52,235
Why are you stringing him along
when you're not even interested?

669
00:37:52,259 --> 00:37:54,606
What do you mean
I'm stringing him along?

670
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:57,776
You're getting
what you can out of him.

671
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:01,675
The free meat, the flowers,
and rides on the motorbike.

672
00:38:01,699 --> 00:38:04,199
You're giving him false hope.

673
00:38:04,339 --> 00:38:06,440
In other words,
you're being a gold digger.

674
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,455
What do you think
you're accusing me of?

675
00:38:10,479 --> 00:38:13,580
Did you seriously
just call me a gold digger?

676
00:38:14,309 --> 00:38:17,080
Let's say that I am
stringing him along.

677
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:18,850
Why are you getting upset about it?

678
00:38:19,449 --> 00:38:21,419
Are you his family?

679
00:38:21,919 --> 00:38:23,720
Are you like his little sister?

680
00:38:27,289 --> 00:38:31,330
We're good neighbors.
That's right. We're friends.

681
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,976
I've known him for 10 years now.

682
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,045
That qualifies me as his family.

683
00:38:39,069 --> 00:38:42,880
Is that so? I had no idea
that he had a family member...

684
00:38:43,009 --> 00:38:45,880
who sticks her head in
where it doesn't belong.

685
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:50,256
I'm just sick and tired...

686
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:53,650
of the way
you've been treating him.

687
00:38:55,889 --> 00:39:00,166
I wouldn't be this annoyed
if you were a stunning beauty.

688
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:01,660
But...

689
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,069
Are you saying that because
you think you're prettier than I am?

690
00:39:07,229 --> 00:39:08,769
I won't deny it.

691
00:39:09,669 --> 00:39:12,509
Unbelievable.
You're hilarious, Button Eyes.

692
00:39:14,009 --> 00:39:17,186
What did you just call me?
Button Eyes?

693
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:19,180
I was only talking to myself.

694
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:22,150
Besides, you were the first
to judge me on my looks.

695
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:42,376
The liquor couldn't be sweeter.

696
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,769
I could drink for days.

697
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:50,756
Just so you know,
no one at this market...

698
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:54,009
can hold their liquor like I can.

699
00:39:54,919 --> 00:39:58,120
One's alcohol intake isn't
something to brag about, old lady.

700
00:39:58,319 --> 00:39:59,620
Old lady?

701
00:40:00,819 --> 00:40:03,620
Besides, you're the one
who bragged first.

702
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:19,710
So tell me.

703
00:40:20,269 --> 00:40:22,579
Are your eyes open or not?

704
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:27,979
They're open.

705
00:40:29,949 --> 00:40:32,289
They're open wide.

706
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:34,889
Bottoms up.

707
00:40:35,289 --> 00:40:36,389
Got it.

708
00:40:43,059 --> 00:40:44,200
Anyway,

709
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:47,830
this is your last chance.

710
00:40:48,799 --> 00:40:50,970
Just give up already.

711
00:40:54,039 --> 00:40:55,179
Give up.

712
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,080
Darn it.

713
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,379
Give up?

714
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:03,850
I...

715
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:07,650
will never do such a thing,

716
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:10,260
Ms. Piggy.

717
00:41:10,619 --> 00:41:14,460
What?
You're a resilient one, aren't you?

718
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:17,499
Fine, let's drink.

719
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:20,869
Drink it all.

720
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,345
Darn.

721
00:41:22,369 --> 00:41:23,369
Drink it all.

722
00:41:23,799 --> 00:41:27,140
- Don't you dare drink it all.
- Go ahead.

723
00:41:28,169 --> 00:41:30,239
- You drank all of it yourself.
- Bottoms up.

724
00:41:32,879 --> 00:41:36,520
Bottoms up... Yes, bottoms up.

725
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:47,260
I won, I won

726
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:04,939
Gosh.

727
00:42:06,249 --> 00:42:08,010
Being angry was a good look on you.

728
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:12,189
I can't believe you're old enough
to talk back to me.

729
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,390
Maybe...

730
00:42:20,859 --> 00:42:23,400
you would've been better off
with your dad.

731
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,700
You could've exercised with him...

732
00:42:29,169 --> 00:42:30,539
and go to the sauna together.

733
00:42:33,239 --> 00:42:35,085
Maybe I shouldn't have
brought you with me.

734
00:42:35,109 --> 00:42:36,210
That's not it.

735
00:42:37,979 --> 00:42:39,780
I followed you out.

736
00:42:40,179 --> 00:42:41,580
I wanted to live with you.

737
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:44,720
Wait, weren't you asleep?

738
00:42:46,919 --> 00:42:50,320
You woke me by stroking my hair.

739
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:53,390
I see.

740
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:55,400
Sorry about that.

741
00:42:56,499 --> 00:42:58,030
I like my life,

742
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:02,439
so don't even think that way again.

743
00:43:05,369 --> 00:43:06,369
Really?

744
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:11,210
All right, I won't.

745
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:18,590
Ji Hun,

746
00:43:21,189 --> 00:43:23,419
you're my everything, you know.

747
00:43:25,090 --> 00:43:28,030
You're all that I have in my life.

748
00:43:28,929 --> 00:43:29,960
Same here.

749
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:35,770
Can't you say
something sweeter than that?

750
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:39,439
Good night.

751
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:43,439
My charming little boy.

752
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:47,150
I love how chic you are.

753
00:43:47,479 --> 00:43:50,350
Mom, stop it. I can't breathe.

754
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:53,626
No way.
This is how it'll be tonight.

755
00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:55,989
I'll hug you all night,
so don't you stop me.

756
00:43:57,189 --> 00:43:58,729
But you're crushing me.

757
00:44:07,470 --> 00:44:10,239
All right. This is the morning
of a historic day.

758
00:44:10,369 --> 00:44:14,239
What happens today will
make or break our action company.

759
00:44:14,410 --> 00:44:16,290
- Please tell me you're confident.
- Sure thing.

760
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:18,410
Don't you worry, Joon Seon.

761
00:44:18,549 --> 00:44:20,886
I had one sweet dream last night.

762
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:22,626
Really? What was it about?

763
00:44:22,650 --> 00:44:25,665
Dreaming of girl groups
don't mean a thing.

764
00:44:25,689 --> 00:44:27,220
This one's for real though.

765
00:44:27,619 --> 00:44:30,119
In my dream,
we were eating ramyeon...

766
00:44:30,289 --> 00:44:33,960
when a white tiger this big
bit down on my leg.

767
00:44:34,359 --> 00:44:36,306
Is that a lucky dream?

768
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:38,236
Of course.
Don't you know what a tiger is?

769
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:40,546
The king of all animals.
The greatest creature of all.

770
00:44:40,570 --> 00:44:43,845
And none other than
a rare white tiger chose me.

771
00:44:43,869 --> 00:44:45,946
My gosh. No way.

772
00:44:45,970 --> 00:44:47,046
Joon Seon, look.

773
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:50,015
"Your business will thrive
and fame will follow."

774
00:44:50,039 --> 00:44:51,850
- It's the luckiest dream ever.
- No way!

775
00:44:52,309 --> 00:44:53,725
What did I tell you?

776
00:44:53,749 --> 00:44:56,619
The camera will get
a shot of my face today.

777
00:44:57,479 --> 00:44:58,590
Jong Soo,

778
00:44:58,950 --> 00:45:00,420
let me buy that dream.

779
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:01,749
No.

780
00:45:01,859 --> 00:45:02,989
Come on.

781
00:45:03,489 --> 00:45:07,129
Sell me that dream. You don't
have much to do today anyway.

782
00:45:07,529 --> 00:45:10,475
Okay, fine.
I'll trade it for my tracksuit...

783
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:11,975
that you like.

784
00:45:11,999 --> 00:45:14,129
It's the only big brand
tracksuit I have...

785
00:45:14,269 --> 00:45:15,399
and it's the real deal.

786
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:17,970
I'm trading down,

787
00:45:18,399 --> 00:45:20,816
but I'll let you have it
since you have seniority.

788
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:24,286
Okay, good.
Throw that dream of yours to me.

789
00:45:24,310 --> 00:45:26,786
Got it. Here it comes.

790
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:28,085
Take it.

791
00:45:28,109 --> 00:45:29,125
I got it.

792
00:45:29,149 --> 00:45:30,755
- Take it.
- Got it.

793
00:45:30,779 --> 00:45:32,095
- Take it.
- I dropped it.

794
00:45:32,119 --> 00:45:34,690
Joon Seon, don't step on my dream!

795
00:45:35,090 --> 00:45:36,436
- Got it.
- Here's another.

796
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:37,696
I got it.

797
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:39,906
You crazy jerks. Stop that already.

798
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:41,060
- Got it.
- Jeong Bong.

799
00:45:41,159 --> 00:45:42,306
What you dropped is mine.

800
00:45:42,330 --> 00:45:43,835
- No way.
- Hand it over.

801
00:45:43,859 --> 00:45:45,375
- Wait.
- It's mine!

802
00:45:45,399 --> 00:45:48,715
- But I bought it.
- Let me have some of it.

803
00:45:48,739 --> 00:45:51,670
- Come on!
- Breakfast is ready!

804
00:45:52,269 --> 00:45:55,485
Why does she want a bag
she has no use for?

805
00:45:55,509 --> 00:45:57,239
She can be so childish.

806
00:45:57,739 --> 00:46:00,186
Why did you try to take
what was offered to her?

807
00:46:00,210 --> 00:46:02,526
I could've bought you a new one.

808
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:04,355
Why would you spend money on one?

809
00:46:04,379 --> 00:46:05,965
She said she didn't need it.

810
00:46:05,989 --> 00:46:09,790
Still. There's no need
to keep clashing into her.

811
00:46:11,159 --> 00:46:12,705
Whose side are you taking?

812
00:46:12,729 --> 00:46:15,105
Did you grow a soft spot for her
while working for her?

813
00:46:15,129 --> 00:46:16,759
Of course not.

814
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:18,705
Ga Hee, is the soup ready?

815
00:46:18,729 --> 00:46:20,029
Yes, I'm coming.

816
00:46:20,129 --> 00:46:23,076
Gosh, it smells delicious.
Is it radish soup with beef?

817
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:24,115
- Good morning.
- Ga Hee, my gosh.

818
00:46:24,139 --> 00:46:25,345
Please put that down.

819
00:46:25,369 --> 00:46:26,739
Let me...

820
00:46:29,210 --> 00:46:32,080
- What just happened?
- What's going on?

821
00:46:33,979 --> 00:46:35,396
- How about this?
- It hurts.

822
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:36,619
- Here?
- It hurts.

823
00:46:38,989 --> 00:46:41,019
I think he fractured his bone.

824
00:46:41,649 --> 00:46:44,635
You may not need surgery,
but you'll need to stay in a cast.

825
00:46:44,659 --> 00:46:47,090
What? Then what about today's shoot?

826
00:46:47,290 --> 00:46:49,536
Of course he can't do it.

827
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:50,830
He won't be even able to walk.

828
00:46:51,499 --> 00:46:53,970
No, Joon Seon. I can do it.

829
00:46:55,269 --> 00:46:57,615
Don't go to unnecessary lengths.

830
00:46:57,639 --> 00:46:59,845
Your ankle will only get worse.

831
00:46:59,869 --> 00:47:01,186
Oh, dear.

832
00:47:01,210 --> 00:47:04,016
Now I feel terrible.
He was only trying to help.

833
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:06,186
Please don't say that.
I'm fine, Ga Hee.

834
00:47:06,210 --> 00:47:07,926
You're not fine at all!

835
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:10,180
How can you shoot today's scenes
on that ankle?

836
00:47:10,249 --> 00:47:11,920
Today is the most important day.

837
00:47:12,050 --> 00:47:15,690
I can't believe this just happened.
You've got to be kidding me.

838
00:47:15,989 --> 00:47:17,220
I'm sorry.

839
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:20,560
Maybe I shouldn't have
bought Jong Soo's dream.

840
00:47:23,259 --> 00:47:24,830
What now?

841
00:47:24,899 --> 00:47:26,806
Can someone else fill in?

842
00:47:26,830 --> 00:47:28,916
There isn't anyone.
Everyone I know...

843
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:30,700
are members
of the company I worked at.

844
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:33,186
Our teamwork is one thing,

845
00:47:33,210 --> 00:47:36,180
but we need someone athletic enough
to manage the moves.

846
00:47:36,810 --> 00:47:38,979
Where do we find someone like that?

847
00:47:41,009 --> 00:47:43,119
Wait. He's right here.

848
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:52,005
Hyo Sin, please.

849
00:47:52,029 --> 00:47:54,066
Just help me this once.

850
00:47:54,090 --> 00:47:57,359
You have a fit body
and are well-coordinated.

851
00:47:57,529 --> 00:47:59,676
All you have to do
is walk around for us.

852
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:02,220
We'll do everything else including
all the kicking and punching.

853
00:48:02,769 --> 00:48:05,446
I can't. I already told you I can't.

854
00:48:05,470 --> 00:48:07,546
How can you say that
without even trying?

855
00:48:07,570 --> 00:48:09,379
It's not that you can't.
You just won't.

856
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:12,050
- Then I won't do it.
- Hey!

857
00:48:12,749 --> 00:48:14,909
Come on, don't be a jerk.

858
00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:18,196
Have you always been
this cruel and cold-hearted?

859
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:20,365
Joon Seon, it won't work.

860
00:48:20,389 --> 00:48:22,489
- He's bigger than me and...
- Shut it.

861
00:48:23,489 --> 00:48:25,705
You're smaller than
the actor you're playing anyway.

862
00:48:25,729 --> 00:48:28,930
We can make it work since
he'll be shot from afar and behind.

863
00:48:29,129 --> 00:48:31,029
Hyo Sin, can't you do this?

864
00:48:31,129 --> 00:48:34,345
Think about who we are to you.

865
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:36,646
We live here together
in this small crowded space.

866
00:48:36,670 --> 00:48:39,316
That makes us family!

867
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:42,056
I'm not so sure about that.
Do family members...

868
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:45,385
scold you for taking
too long in the shower?

869
00:48:45,409 --> 00:48:46,409
Who did that?

870
00:48:46,950 --> 00:48:49,526
Him? This moron right here?

871
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:51,396
- Was it him?
- Joon Seon, please.

872
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:53,749
- It hurts.
- Whatever. I'm off to work.

873
00:48:54,050 --> 00:48:56,595
I can't afford
to skip deliveries today.

874
00:48:56,619 --> 00:48:58,790
I'll talk to my dad about that.

875
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:00,766
I know it's a lot to ask,

876
00:49:00,790 --> 00:49:02,436
but that's how desperate I am.

877
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:05,830
Hyo Sin, please.
Just help me this once.

878
00:49:07,670 --> 00:49:09,546
What if I got on my knees?
I'll do that right now.

879
00:49:09,570 --> 00:49:12,016
- Joon Seon!
- Gosh, stop that.

880
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:14,345
Shut it and get on your knees too.

881
00:49:14,369 --> 00:49:15,440
- Right now.
- Got it.

882
00:49:15,739 --> 00:49:18,109
Please. Just help us this once.

883
00:49:18,749 --> 00:49:21,656
- Will bowing help?
- Joon Seon, stop!

884
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,879
Fine, just do whatever you want.

885
00:49:24,149 --> 00:49:27,225
You'd better get him back
before dinner time though.

886
00:49:27,249 --> 00:49:28,889
If you don't,
I'll hold you accountable.

887
00:49:29,519 --> 00:49:32,629
And make sure
he doesn't injure himself.

888
00:49:33,090 --> 00:49:35,930
Be good to him. Unbelievable.

889
00:49:36,899 --> 00:49:39,845
I can't even turn a blind eye
because he's my son.

890
00:49:39,869 --> 00:49:42,300
Although, he's more like
an enemy most days.

891
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:48,440
- Excuse me.
- Hello, ma'am. Can I help you?

892
00:49:48,810 --> 00:49:52,125
Are you perhaps Song Young Dal
who used to live in Yeongcheon?

893
00:49:52,149 --> 00:49:55,050
Yes, that's me.
May I ask who you are?

894
00:49:55,279 --> 00:49:57,680
My gosh.
It really is you, Young Dal.

895
00:49:59,050 --> 00:50:00,420
Don't you recognize me?

896
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:02,135
I'm Ji Hyang Soon,

897
00:50:02,159 --> 00:50:03,859
the second daughter
of the oil store owner.

898
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:05,560
Hyang Soon?

899
00:50:08,029 --> 00:50:10,676
Hyang Soon with the pigtails?

900
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:13,105
- That's right.
- My goodness!

901
00:50:13,129 --> 00:50:15,205
- Gosh.
- My gosh.

902
00:50:15,229 --> 00:50:16,700
I can't believe it.

903
00:50:19,710 --> 00:50:22,040
Here you go.

904
00:50:24,139 --> 00:50:26,180
Gosh, hasn't it been decades?

905
00:50:27,649 --> 00:50:30,180
Staying alive has its perks.

906
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:32,619
Tell me about it.

907
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:35,859
How did you recognize me though?

908
00:50:35,989 --> 00:50:38,365
I bet I look nothing
like my old self.

909
00:50:38,389 --> 00:50:39,690
As if.

910
00:50:39,790 --> 00:50:42,475
You look the same
apart from the wrinkles.

911
00:50:42,499 --> 00:50:43,729
Goodness.

912
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:49,239
Did you stay in Yeongcheon
after my family moved to Seoul?

913
00:50:50,139 --> 00:50:52,646
That reminds me.
What about your little sister?

914
00:50:52,670 --> 00:50:53,909
Is she well?

915
00:50:55,409 --> 00:50:58,879
My mom suggested
she move to another city...

916
00:50:59,109 --> 00:51:01,749
and work for her cousin
as a live-in babysitter, remember?

917
00:51:03,249 --> 00:51:04,680
She passed away.

918
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:06,950
What?

919
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:09,619
She suffered from a high fever.

920
00:51:09,889 --> 00:51:11,389
I went to see her,

921
00:51:11,859 --> 00:51:14,529
but the family she worked for
had run off in the night...

922
00:51:14,629 --> 00:51:16,830
and my sister
had already passed away.

923
00:51:16,930 --> 00:51:18,129
Really?

924
00:51:19,269 --> 00:51:20,470
My goodness.

925
00:51:21,729 --> 00:51:25,399
Were you never able
to recover a body?

926
00:51:26,239 --> 00:51:29,340
I don't know how she died
or how long she was ill for.

927
00:51:29,509 --> 00:51:31,680
There was no way to find out.

928
00:51:33,509 --> 00:51:36,420
My gosh. We had no idea.

929
00:51:40,619 --> 00:51:42,050
By the way,

930
00:51:42,889 --> 00:51:44,989
I visited my mother's family
a few years ago...

931
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:48,529
and I heard some news
about her cousin.

932
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:51,759
The family...

933
00:51:52,499 --> 00:51:54,769
runs a shoe store in Dapsimni.

934
00:51:55,229 --> 00:51:56,440
Dapsimni?

935
00:51:57,570 --> 00:51:59,940
Do you know the exact location?

936
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:01,769
No, I don't.

937
00:52:01,970 --> 00:52:05,609
Someone saw them
or heard about them I guess.

938
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:09,796
They were mentioned in passing
when we were exchanging...

939
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:11,749
news about each other.

940
00:52:15,249 --> 00:52:18,290
What? What kind of errand?

941
00:52:19,090 --> 00:52:22,460
All right. Ok Ja and I will
try to manage, so don't be too late.

942
00:52:22,759 --> 00:52:25,330
Sure thing. See you later.

943
00:52:26,970 --> 00:52:30,016
He said he'd be briefly
stopping by the office,

944
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:31,639
but now he has an errand to run.

945
00:52:31,999 --> 00:52:34,369
Never-ending work
is the story of my life.

946
00:52:34,970 --> 00:52:37,979
Anyway, where on earth is Ok Ja?
She should be here by now.

947
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:40,080
Ok Boon...

948
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:42,720
Why are you running
late this morning?

949
00:52:42,979 --> 00:52:45,556
It's just the two of us,
so I need all hands on deck.

950
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:48,550
We need to fry the chicken
and sell them all ourselves.

951
00:52:49,090 --> 00:52:52,036
Ok Boon, I think I'm going to die.

952
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:53,859
Actually, I'd rather die,
so kill me.

953
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:58,529
Gosh, you reek of alcohol.
Did you drink last night?

954
00:52:58,729 --> 00:53:01,875
How much does one need to drink
to smell like a barrel of alcohol?

955
00:53:01,899 --> 00:53:05,470
Stop overreacting.
I only drank a few bottles.

956
00:53:05,739 --> 00:53:08,446
2, 3, 4, 5, 6 bottles.

957
00:53:08,470 --> 00:53:11,340
How could you do this
when you have work the next day?

958
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:15,485
What's gotten into you lately?

959
00:53:15,509 --> 00:53:17,526
Are you upset with me
or your brother-in-law?

960
00:53:17,550 --> 00:53:19,749
Tell us if you are...

961
00:53:19,790 --> 00:53:21,865
instead of being moody and silent.

962
00:53:21,889 --> 00:53:23,460
That's not the case.

963
00:53:24,290 --> 00:53:26,190
I'm lonely, that's all.

964
00:53:26,830 --> 00:53:28,560
They say every shoe comes in pairs,

965
00:53:28,689 --> 00:53:31,230
but I don't
which makes me feel broken.

966
00:53:31,730 --> 00:53:32,800
My gosh.

967
00:53:33,730 --> 00:53:36,316
Why on earth would you be broken?

968
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:39,040
You just haven't met
the right man, that's all.

969
00:53:39,369 --> 00:53:41,645
You're quite charming...

970
00:53:41,669 --> 00:53:45,486
and you'll someday meet a man
who treasures you.

971
00:53:45,510 --> 00:53:47,580
So pull yourself together...

972
00:53:48,050 --> 00:53:50,395
and finish making the batter.

973
00:53:50,419 --> 00:53:52,996
I'll heat up the oil.

974
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:55,090
All right.

975
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:01,605
She only said that
to get me working.

976
00:54:01,629 --> 00:54:03,330
Spoken like a true owner.

977
00:54:09,869 --> 00:54:13,540
I drank too much
because of that Button Eyes.

978
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:15,240
Gosh, my head.

979
00:54:16,109 --> 00:54:18,810
Getting fresh air isn't working.

980
00:54:19,409 --> 00:54:23,449
If I drink again, I'm a brute,
not a human being.

981
00:54:24,119 --> 00:54:25,296
Gosh.

982
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:27,219
Was the mountain always that high?

983
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:39,770
(Dapsimni)

984
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,046
If he buried her after death,

985
00:54:43,070 --> 00:54:45,240
he might remember where it was.

986
00:54:45,469 --> 00:54:48,340
But it's not like there are
few shoe stores in Dapsimni.

987
00:54:48,669 --> 00:54:49,909
Are you sure you can find them?

988
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:52,655
- Excuse me.
- Welcome.

989
00:54:52,679 --> 00:54:55,486
It's like looking for a needle
in a haystack.

990
00:54:55,510 --> 00:54:57,780
Excuse me. I got the wrong place.

991
00:55:06,230 --> 00:55:07,760
Excuse me.

992
00:55:08,830 --> 00:55:12,199
Did you live in Yeongcheon
a long time ago by any chance?

993
00:55:12,359 --> 00:55:13,645
No, I didn't.

994
00:55:13,669 --> 00:55:14,869
Oh, I see.

995
00:55:15,939 --> 00:55:17,399
Okay. Thank you.

996
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:26,080
Bye.

997
00:55:49,070 --> 00:55:50,476
You can't just bring...

998
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:54,085
a new stuntman after the test shot.

999
00:55:54,109 --> 00:55:56,390
Why would you have test shots
if you were being like this?

1000
00:55:56,639 --> 00:55:59,310
I'm sorry. He sprained his ankle.

1001
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:02,179
He's new, but he's just as good.

1002
00:56:02,310 --> 00:56:05,520
And he has the build
that's more similar to the actor's.

1003
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:09,135
If you don't like him, we can
replace him for the next shooting.

1004
00:56:09,159 --> 00:56:11,219
You should've been careful.

1005
00:56:12,459 --> 00:56:14,090
You do have a fine figure,

1006
00:56:15,090 --> 00:56:16,410
but are you sure you can do this?

1007
00:56:17,030 --> 00:56:18,476
I'm not sure...

1008
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,675
He says he can do this.
You can rely on him.

1009
00:56:20,699 --> 00:56:22,639
You do sound determined.

1010
00:56:22,939 --> 00:56:25,240
All right. I guess
I don't have a choice.

1011
00:56:27,969 --> 00:56:29,010
Min Su.

1012
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:34,379
You remember the moves I taught you.
Just make sure to stick to them.

1013
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:37,056
Just try to imitate us,
and we will take care of the rest.

1014
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:39,750
I'll do Jeong Bong's spinning kick.

1015
00:56:40,149 --> 00:56:42,736
Are you sure you can do this?
You do have a long moving line.

1016
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:45,290
I have no choice but to do it.
Do you want me to give up?

1017
00:56:46,659 --> 00:56:49,500
And you. Don't dream
in your sleep again.

1018
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:52,576
If you do it again,
I'll just kill you.

1019
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:53,629
Okay.

1020
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,076
Let's just make it through today.

1021
00:56:56,100 --> 00:56:58,845
Once Jeong Bong gets better,
we can change it again. Okay?

1022
00:56:58,869 --> 00:56:59,939
- Yes.
- Yes.

1023
00:57:00,209 --> 00:57:01,486
- Let's do this.
- Okay.

1024
00:57:01,510 --> 00:57:02,909
- Good luck.
- All right.

1025
00:57:03,679 --> 00:57:05,409
Just go shoot a video.

1026
00:57:05,780 --> 00:57:06,810
Okay.

1027
00:57:07,209 --> 00:57:08,379
Ready.

1028
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:11,020
Action.

1029
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:29,100
What?

1030
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:31,070
Did you just see him?

1031
00:57:31,570 --> 00:57:32,570
My gosh.

1032
00:58:11,379 --> 00:58:13,625
Cut. Okay. That was great.

1033
00:58:13,649 --> 00:58:15,550
You're amazing.

1034
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:17,649
Well done.

1035
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:19,419
- Gosh.
- Well done.

1036
00:58:19,719 --> 00:58:20,750
Nice work.

1037
00:58:22,689 --> 00:58:23,719
I like it.

1038
00:58:24,619 --> 00:58:26,865
This is pickled garlic...

1039
00:58:26,889 --> 00:58:28,935
I've been eating in secret
without the girls.

1040
00:58:28,959 --> 00:58:33,399
And this is pickled perilla leaves.
I brushed them with sauce...

1041
00:58:33,570 --> 00:58:36,100
1 by 1 yesterday.

1042
00:58:36,770 --> 00:58:38,375
You didn't have to do this.

1043
00:58:38,399 --> 00:58:40,185
I just had to.

1044
00:58:40,209 --> 00:58:42,570
You don't look as good
as you used to do.

1045
00:58:42,709 --> 00:58:46,026
I'm just getting old.
It's just nature taking its course.

1046
00:58:46,050 --> 00:58:49,649
I know. But you should
watch what you eat now.

1047
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:52,556
Dad. I mean, Monk.

1048
00:58:52,580 --> 00:58:55,719
Without you, I'm like
a kite without a string.

1049
00:58:55,820 --> 00:58:58,835
When I went through
all sorts of things running a bar,

1050
00:58:58,859 --> 00:59:00,966
I could hold out because of you...

1051
00:59:00,990 --> 00:59:04,060
as I thought I had
at least one person on my side.

1052
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:08,345
Okay. I get it.
I'll make sure to eat right.

1053
00:59:08,369 --> 00:59:09,469
Thank you.

1054
00:59:10,770 --> 00:59:12,986
Make sure to eat them
with your meals.

1055
00:59:13,010 --> 00:59:15,115
And don't share them
with other monks.

1056
00:59:15,139 --> 00:59:16,340
Okay.

1057
00:59:17,510 --> 00:59:20,580
I should give you
some nice tea in return.

1058
00:59:20,810 --> 00:59:23,449
I just picked some good tea leaves
a few days ago.

1059
00:59:23,919 --> 00:59:25,480
- Wait here.
- Okay.

1060
00:59:25,649 --> 00:59:26,865
I'll put these in the fridge.

1061
00:59:26,889 --> 00:59:27,919
Okay.

1062
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:36,959
Hello.

1063
00:59:37,429 --> 00:59:41,006
Hello, sir. I've been seeing you
quite often lately.

1064
00:59:41,030 --> 00:59:44,476
I know. I just stopped by
to see my sister.

1065
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:45,639
Okay.

1066
00:59:46,369 --> 00:59:48,786
If you have some time,

1067
00:59:48,810 --> 00:59:51,209
would you join me for some tea?

1068
00:59:51,639 --> 00:59:52,810
Okay.

1069
00:59:57,350 --> 00:59:59,766
I guess you have company.

1070
00:59:59,790 --> 01:00:03,536
Yes. She's the important person
I talked about before.

1071
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:05,859
She wouldn't mind if you joined us.

1072
01:00:06,129 --> 01:00:07,429
Who knows?

1073
01:00:07,590 --> 01:00:10,260
She might become
an important person to you too.

1074
01:00:11,429 --> 01:00:15,100
No. I will just go
see my sister today.

1075
01:00:15,469 --> 01:00:18,500
- All right then.
- Okay.

1076
01:00:22,570 --> 01:00:24,310
(Song Young Suk,
Born March 19, 1967)

1077
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:35,790
I'll come again. Make sure
not to skip meals.

1078
01:01:06,850 --> 01:01:09,050
(Neulpuleun Children's Hospital)

1079
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:13,730
- Dr. Yoon.
- Bye. See you tomorrow.

1080
01:01:21,570 --> 01:01:23,270
Ms. Song, where are you now?

1081
01:01:27,340 --> 01:01:28,369
What?

1082
01:01:29,409 --> 01:01:31,909
In the public library.
I'm studying hard.

1083
01:01:34,209 --> 01:01:35,449
She's studying hard.

1084
01:01:36,250 --> 01:01:37,530
Everything about her is so cute.

1085
01:01:39,820 --> 01:01:41,389
This is crazy.

1086
01:01:41,719 --> 01:01:42,919
"I'm studying hard."

1087
01:01:44,219 --> 01:01:45,320
Wait.

1088
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:48,359
I don't like my hair.

1089
01:01:50,659 --> 01:01:51,699
Okay.

1090
01:02:31,469 --> 01:02:32,469
Gosh, Mr. Yoon.

1091
01:02:33,770 --> 01:02:34,840
Sorry.

1092
01:02:35,869 --> 01:02:37,639
What brings you here?

1093
01:02:38,510 --> 01:02:39,609
What did you say?

1094
01:02:41,310 --> 01:02:42,379
Here.

1095
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:46,850
After I came back to Korea,

1096
01:02:46,919 --> 01:02:50,536
I found out dentists need
computer-related certificates.

1097
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:52,760
So I'm preparing for it.

1098
01:02:53,359 --> 01:02:55,030
Did you study a lot?

1099
01:02:55,189 --> 01:02:57,835
Yes. With people
studying hard around me,

1100
01:02:57,859 --> 01:02:59,399
I can stay focused.

1101
01:03:00,929 --> 01:03:02,330
So that's how you feel.

1102
01:03:03,100 --> 01:03:07,510
I guess I should serve
as a model for you.

1103
01:03:07,570 --> 01:03:08,810
That'd be great for me.

1104
01:03:11,939 --> 01:03:14,250
It's almost time,
so I'm nervous again.

1105
01:03:15,050 --> 01:03:17,619
I'm studying math with Na Hee today.

1106
01:03:17,879 --> 01:03:20,389
I should prepare my lesson
if I don't want to get hit.

1107
01:03:20,590 --> 01:03:23,895
I can't believe her. Why would she
hit such a small person like you?

1108
01:03:23,919 --> 01:03:25,859
She doesn't even care.

1109
01:03:25,959 --> 01:03:28,639
She just slaps me in the back, arms,
forehead, and back of the head.

1110
01:03:29,659 --> 01:03:32,429
Do you want me
to help you with that?

1111
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:36,570
I told you. I'm a genius in math.

1112
01:03:38,169 --> 01:03:41,046
If you get some lessons from me
before studying with Na Hee,

1113
01:03:41,070 --> 01:03:43,516
you will never forget it.

1114
01:03:43,540 --> 01:03:45,409
I'd love that.

1115
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:48,780
But you should prepare
for your exam.

1116
01:03:49,209 --> 01:03:51,980
You know I'm smart.

1117
01:03:52,879 --> 01:03:54,949
I'll just teach you a little
while studying.

1118
01:03:56,050 --> 01:03:58,296
And I like to solve math problems...

1119
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:00,659
to rest my mind.

1120
01:04:01,790 --> 01:04:04,899
Shall we meet
at this time every day?

1121
01:04:05,330 --> 01:04:06,669
Every day?

1122
01:04:07,129 --> 01:04:09,816
Isn't that too much? You have a job.

1123
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:12,345
I'm a dentist, so I get off on time,

1124
01:04:12,369 --> 01:04:14,709
and my exam is just a month away.

1125
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:18,840
What do you say? Yes or no?

1126
01:04:19,649 --> 01:04:21,085
It's fine if you say no.

1127
01:04:21,109 --> 01:04:23,320
No, I'll do it. Tutor me.

1128
01:04:23,449 --> 01:04:25,649
But in return, I'll buy dinner.

1129
01:04:25,750 --> 01:04:28,665
- In the basement cafeteria.
- Okay, basement cafeteria.

1130
01:04:28,689 --> 01:04:31,689
Then I'll meet you here
every day until the exam.

1131
01:04:32,020 --> 01:04:33,635
Yes, Mr. Yoon. Oh, no.

1132
01:04:33,659 --> 01:04:35,090
Teacher.

1133
01:04:38,230 --> 01:04:41,429
Do you mind if we start today?

1134
01:04:41,530 --> 01:04:43,415
I'm stuck on a few problems.

1135
01:04:43,439 --> 01:04:46,199
Okay. What are they?
Bring them all to me.

1136
01:04:46,770 --> 01:04:50,439
Now you can solve this
using this formula.

1137
01:04:51,209 --> 01:04:53,409
The one below that as well.

1138
01:04:55,409 --> 01:04:57,326
It gave you this number.

1139
01:04:57,350 --> 01:04:58,956
What do you do with it?

1140
01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:00,195
- Number two.
- Number two?

1141
01:05:00,219 --> 01:05:01,290
Correct!

1142
01:05:02,850 --> 01:05:06,135
- You're a fast learner.
- You're a great teacher.

1143
01:05:06,159 --> 01:05:08,135
This is the only time this is valid.

1144
01:05:08,159 --> 01:05:10,276
This formula here.
What does it mean?

1145
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:12,100
I don't know. What does it mean?

1146
01:05:13,330 --> 01:05:14,806
Sit a little further away.

1147
01:05:14,830 --> 01:05:17,340
Write that down again.
Write it down.

1148
01:05:18,899 --> 01:05:20,585
Can't you test me again?

1149
01:05:20,609 --> 01:05:22,009
Didn't you learn it in high school?

1150
01:05:36,889 --> 01:05:38,520
- Gyu Jin.
- Bo Young.

1151
01:05:39,419 --> 01:05:41,236
It's late. You're leaving now?

1152
01:05:41,260 --> 01:05:42,859
Yes. I did some reading.

1153
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:44,576
Why are you here?

1154
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:47,706
To wash this.
Our usual toilet is busy.

1155
01:05:47,730 --> 01:05:49,070
Oh, I see.

1156
01:05:49,469 --> 01:05:51,046
Oh, how is Si Hoo?

1157
01:05:51,070 --> 01:05:54,040
His breathing is back to normal.

1158
01:05:55,369 --> 01:05:58,609
I owe it to Dr. Song.
She checked on him often.

1159
01:05:59,310 --> 01:06:01,609
What did I tell you?
She's better than me.

1160
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:04,855
Let's go. I need to get something
from the convenience store.

1161
01:06:04,879 --> 01:06:07,590
- Let's go while Si Hoo's asleep.
- Okay. Let's go.

1162
01:06:10,689 --> 01:06:11,859
How are you...

1163
01:06:19,459 --> 01:06:20,629
Yes?

1164
01:06:22,570 --> 01:06:23,645
Are you done?

1165
01:06:23,669 --> 01:06:25,776
Yes. I'm about to go home.

1166
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:28,409
Good. Let's have dinner together.

1167
01:06:29,570 --> 01:06:31,379
I was going to eat at home.

1168
01:06:32,510 --> 01:06:33,956
Eat out with me.

1169
01:06:33,980 --> 01:06:35,526
You said you'd be my buddy.

1170
01:06:35,550 --> 01:06:37,250
Not for dinner too.

1171
01:06:38,020 --> 01:06:39,966
Okay, then. Let's eat.

1172
01:06:39,990 --> 01:06:42,949
Good. I knew you'd say yes,
so I made a reservation.

1173
01:06:46,090 --> 01:06:48,730
The new restaurant
got some nice reviews.

1174
01:06:48,859 --> 01:06:50,129
Are you okay with steak?

1175
01:06:50,699 --> 01:06:52,875
Yes. I'm not craving
anything particular,

1176
01:06:52,899 --> 01:06:54,576
and I usually eat what I'm given.

1177
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:57,270
It's good that you eat
whatever you're given.

1178
01:06:58,740 --> 01:07:01,070
I get that I'm the hospital outcast,

1179
01:07:01,310 --> 01:07:04,286
but why don't you have
any friends to eat with?

1180
01:07:04,310 --> 01:07:05,879
You're wrong. I have many friends.

1181
01:07:06,310 --> 01:07:08,379
No, I don't think you do.

1182
01:07:08,510 --> 01:07:10,625
You always want to eat with me.

1183
01:07:10,649 --> 01:07:13,080
You need to find a girlfriend.

1184
01:07:13,149 --> 01:07:15,949
Why waste money on treating me?

1185
01:07:16,020 --> 01:07:18,060
Treat the woman you like.

1186
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:20,060
That's what I'm doing.

1187
01:07:22,230 --> 01:07:23,300
What do you mean?

1188
01:07:24,699 --> 01:07:26,199
The woman I like...

1189
01:07:26,570 --> 01:07:28,699
is going with me to eat dinner.

1190
01:07:47,149 --> 01:07:48,750
Hi, Si Hoo.

1191
01:07:49,590 --> 01:07:52,189
Okay. Mom will be right back.

1192
01:07:53,020 --> 01:07:54,230
Bye.

1193
01:08:34,629 --> 01:08:37,139
(Once Again)

1194
01:08:37,969 --> 01:08:40,469
Is there anything you want to do
after the exam?

1195
01:08:40,540 --> 01:08:41,845
Do you have a bucket list?

1196
01:08:41,869 --> 01:08:43,256
I want to do a lot.

1197
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:45,909
What about dating?
Will you really not date?

1198
01:08:46,010 --> 01:08:48,310
- Will you bring him next time?
- What?

1199
01:08:50,020 --> 01:08:52,649
Hey, Hyo Sin. Work with us.

1200
01:08:53,219 --> 01:08:55,119
Hey. Hey, Hyo Sin!

1201
01:08:55,219 --> 01:08:56,820
How can I get to him?

1202
01:08:57,859 --> 01:08:59,796
That's how you confess your love.

1203
01:08:59,820 --> 01:09:01,389
Is the director in?

1204
01:09:01,459 --> 01:09:03,576
So, will you date him?

1205
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:06,159
Why? Are you bothered that I might?

1206
01:09:06,260 --> 01:09:09,369
So will you see him or not?
