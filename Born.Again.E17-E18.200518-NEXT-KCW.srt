112

<b>The first autopsy results didn't

00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,510
<b>The way he held the knife, the
place, and the number of times...</b>

114
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,190
<b>he said he stabbed the victim didn't

<b>I'll catch the real culprit
behind the case.</b>

116
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,790
<b>All you have to do is
take the reward.</b>

117
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,290
<b>You seem fixated on her tattoo.</b>

118
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,540
<b>What's this ink?</b>

119
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:31,260
<b>It's not tattoo ink, it's henna.
It's only temporary.</b>

120
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:35,850
<b>But this one is natural henna
mixed with oxidants.</b>

121
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:39,760
<b>Usually, people only use natural
henna due to side effects.</b>

122
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,100
<b>Oxidants...</b>

123
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,100
<b>- What do they do?
- It makes the color more vibrant.</b>

124
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:48,270
<b>The color of the tattoo
and henna stands out more...</b>

125
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,470
<b>only if macrophages are alive.</b>

126
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:50,940
<b>So the oxidants were added...</b>

127
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,940
<b>because the tattoo won't show
on a dead body.</b>

128
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:58,030
<b>I see. The tattoo was applied
after she was murdered.</b>

129
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:00,900
<b>Prosecutor, the tattooist is
the perpetrator!</b>

130
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:04,030
<b>The tattoo is too shabby for that,
don't you think so?</b>

131
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:08,250
<b>This must be an art form for him,
but it looks like a child's work.</b>

132
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:12,830
<b>One other peculiarity is that
phosphorous was found in the ink.</b>

133
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,780
<b>I'll look more into it
and report back to you.</b>

134
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,200
<b>I think we should call it a day.</b>

135
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:21,120
<b>I need to go visit Sa Bin
in the hospital.</b>

136
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:34,000
<b>I have a lantern too.</b>

137
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,120
<b>What kind of a detective doesn't
recognize a UV lantern?</b>

138
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,850
<b>It's not a regular flashlight.</b>

139
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:42,110
<b>You'll need it to take fingerprints
and blood samples on site.</b>

140
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:43,650
<b>Keep it.</b>

141
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,560
<b>I see.</b>

142
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:49,210
<b>So that's what this is.</b>

143
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:50,590
<b>Are you done checking?</b>

144
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:54,650
<b>- Yes.
- I'll put her back in.</b>

145
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,600
<b>Why isn't it moving?</b>

146
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,600
<b>Wait a minute.</b>

147
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:07,700
<b>Is something stuck?
I don't see it though.</b>

148
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,910
<b>Okay.</b>

149
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:15,790
<b>That's it.</b>

150
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:16,810
<b>What is it?</b>

151
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:18,040
<b>Is it luminous paint?</b>

152
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,280
<b>I don't know.</b>

153
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:26,380
<b>We'll need to find that out now.</b>

154
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:51,590
<b>Whose is this?</b>

155
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,050
<b>- A book?
- It must be Jong Bum's.</b>

156
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:59,280
<b>The cover is a medical book,
but the inside is...</b>

157
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:00,510
<b>Why?</b>

158
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:04,760
<b>That's giving me goosebumps.</b>

159

<b>Is your pupil a psychopath?</b>

160

<b>You know, in the movies...</b>

161

<b>psychopaths analyze people's faces

162
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:29,210
<b>When was he in the hospital?</b>

163
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:30,820
<b>How did he know you were here?</b>

164
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,000
<b>He must have heard it from my uncle.</b>

165
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:34,910
<b>He lives in the rooftop house
of my uncle's building.</b>

166
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,900
<b>Wait. Wait a minute.</b>

167
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,930
<b>When you lost your phone...</b>

168
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:43,600

169
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:46,220
<b>Where's your phone?</b>

170
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,950
<b>Hand it over to me. Hurry.</b>

171
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:56,040
<b>I knew it.</b>

172
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:59,250
<b>You've been seriously stalked.</b>

173
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:02,380
<b>Did you know about the tracking
app on your phone?</b>

174
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:05,080
<b>What? No way.</b>

175
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:12,760
<b>Do you think it's a coincidence
that your diary disappeared too?</b>

176
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,530
<b>Stop it, you're scaring me.</b>

177

<b>Is there anyone who shows up

178

179
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:24,270
<b>that knew everything about you,

180
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:30,910
<b>Do you live here? One of my
regulars lives here too.</b>

181
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,430
<b>What?</b>

182
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,230
<b>Do you come here often?</b>

183
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:39,640
<b>You wanted to come with me
to the arcades?</b>

184
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,840
<b>Actually, I wanted to ride
a rollercoaster with you.</b>

<b>Article 250 and 254

193

<b>Let me correct it.</b>

194
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:29,290
<b>I guess it's for when you instigate

195

<b>Instigated murder?</b>

<b>and he showed up with a knife
exactly eight hours later.</b>

198

<b>Were you into instigating homeless

<b>Is there anything I offered

<b>I was just there to apologize.</b>

201

<b>Since he was hurt badly

202

<b>You gave him the motive to kill.</b>

203
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:55,290
<b>The motive to kill?</b>

204
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,600
<b>But you must have it

205
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:03,510
<b>People you hate so much
that you want to kill them.</b>

206
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:05,870
<b>A kill list.</b>

207
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:09,740
<b>Aren't you going to kill them all
once you have the chance?</b>

208
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:13,980
<b>The kill list itself is
the motive to kill.</b>

209
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:17,120
<b>Thus, the motive to kill is...</b>

210
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,950
<b>not given to you by others.</b>

211
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,490
<b>Why are you in the hospital?</b>

212
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:29,090
<b>Are you here to apologize again?</b>

213
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:36,090
<b>A woman I have feelings for is hurt.</b>

214
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:38,040
<b>Obviously, I'm worried.</b>

215
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:39,710
<b>A woman you like?</b>

216
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:43,840
<b>- Who?
- Jung Sa Bin.</b>

217
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:53,630
<b>So you have feelings for her.</b>

218
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:57,720
<b>Yes.</b>

219
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,720
<b>I like her. I like Sa Bin.</b>

220
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,360
<b>This is why I despise

221

<b>Your head is only filled with love
and no apologies.</b>

222
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:13,640
<b>If the person who was stabbed

<b>you liked, a regular human being

<b>shown up here.</b>

225
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,110
<b>You animal.</b>

226
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:23,320
<b>I guess you have
one more reason to kill me.</b>

227
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,960
<b>I will tell her about you...</b>

228
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:27,510
<b>instigating murder to Jang Ma Chul.</b>

229
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,410
<b>I'll tell Sa Bin.</b>

230
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:32,040
<b>Do we still have a business
left between us?</b>

231
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,960
<b>I'm sure you caught

232
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,870
<b>Didn't you want to kill me?</b>

233
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:40,470
<b>The Lim Hwa Young case isn't
closed for me.</b>

234
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,870
<b>You're still a culprit.</b>

235
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,170
<b>One more thing.</b>

236
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,310
<b>My motive to kill is my principle.</b>

237
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:47,470
<b>My principle is...</b>

238
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:50,800
<b>to get rid of the scumbags
who harm my people.</b>

239
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:53,310
<b>Is Jung Sa Bin one of your people?</b>

240

<b>Go and protect the woman

241
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:22,310
<b>Hello, professor. You can go ahead.</b>

242
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:25,350
<b>It's called UV ink. It was popular
overseas a while back.</b>

243
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:28,710
<b>The fluorescent material reacts to
the UV light to glow.</b>

244
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:33,690
<b>The material is known to cause skin
cancer, so it's not used anymore.</b>

245
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:35,050
<b>Then...</b>

246
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:39,090
<b>if I raid all the tattoo shops here,
I'll be able to find the buyer.</b>

247

<b>How did you know...</b>

248
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:57,980
<b>- I liked these?
- I didn't.</b>

249
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,850
<b>I like these too.</b>

250
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:02,350
<b>The purple tulip is...</b>

<b>- something you like too?
- They looked pretty on my way here.</b>

252
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,820
<b>How did you know...</b>

253
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:12,420
<b>riding roller coaster was one

258
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:26,860
<b>Do you mean that?</b>

259
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:28,570
<b>Yes.</b>

260
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,610
<b>Can you leave me now?

262
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:36,950
<b>You left your bag.</b>

263
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,380

<b>Your father almost got hurt

268

<b>This time, you almost died

269
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:01,570
<b>That's why I'm telling you

270
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:03,570
<b>People around you will get hurt.</b>

271
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:06,240
<b>- How do you feel?
- I'm fine.</b>

272
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,510
<b>I'll be going home soon

<b>I'll give you a gift instead.</b>

275

<b>A gift?</b>

276
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,810
<b>Why are you giving this...</b>

277
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,950
<b>But,</b>

278
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:21,320
<b>I won't be able to use this
because I'm bad with gadgets.</b>

279
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:24,420
<b>It's a smartwatch from the police

280
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,350
<b>If you press a button

281

<b>it will reach

282

<b>That's strange.</b>

283

<b>Why is the station number

<b>I guess it's a policeman's number.</b>

<b>What's the name of the policeman?</b>

286

<b>Can I ask...</b>

<b>The watch has a tracking feature.

<b>Is my location being sent

291
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:17,340
<b>You know what that means.</b>

292
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:20,340
<b>You should stop crossing lines

293

<b>I heard from Detective Ju.</b>

294
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,230
<b>I heard the person

<b>It's Chun Jong Bum, isn't it?</b>

297
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:41,930
<b>It was a medical student.</b>

298
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:06,980
<b>Are you trying to prove

<b>(I can kill that woman

<b>What's wrong?
