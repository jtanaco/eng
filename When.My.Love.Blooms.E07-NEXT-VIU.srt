00:22:47,068 --> 00:22:50,399
<b>was kind and affectionate since she was young.</b>

321
00:22:51,268 --> 00:22:55,109
<b>She was never firm and was easily swayed.</b>

322
00:22:56,179 --> 00:23:00,709
<b>That's why she always gave in, willingly took a loss,</b>

323
00:23:01,008 --> 00:23:02,919
<b>and shared what she has.</b>

324
00:23:03,578 --> 00:23:07,048
<b>All she got in return was betrayal, manipulation,</b>

325
00:23:07,449 --> 00:23:08,788
<b>and loss of her belongings.</b>

326
00:23:11,588 --> 00:23:15,498
<b>I was more worried for her because of what she was like.</b>

327
00:23:17,659 --> 00:23:20,528
<b>I was afraid she'd take the wrong path.</b>

328
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:25,838
<b>If you don't give up on her,</b>

329
00:23:26,669 --> 00:23:29,078
<b>you'll rot in prison for a good few years.</b>

330
00:23:30,978 --> 00:23:32,409
<b>You'll never graduate...</b>

331
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,419
<b>and won't be able to find employment.</b>

332
00:23:35,949 --> 00:23:37,149
<b>You'll use...</b>

333
00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:41,119
<b>your authority for personal gain?</b>

334
00:23:42,518 --> 00:23:44,288
<b>You could say that.</b>

335
00:23:45,088 --> 00:23:46,389
<b>I won't let this happen.</b>

336
00:23:47,588 --> 00:23:50,659
<b>This is oppression and abuse for personal revenge.</b>

337
00:23:51,528 --> 00:23:52,798
<b>I'll let the world know.</b>

338

<b>You're out at last.</b>

<b>Ma'am, Jae Hyun didn't get a prison sentence.</b>

354
00:26:18,338 --> 00:26:20,649
<b>- He doesn't need to eat tofu. - Even so.</b>

<b>Are you okay? You're healthy?</b>

356
00:26:29,189 --> 00:26:33,288
<b>You don't have to go to prison, right?</b>

357
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,199
<b>And you can graduate?</b>

358
00:26:37,828 --> 00:26:39,399
<b>- Yes. - Good.</b>

359

<b>Jae Hyun and I broke up.</b>

360

<b>Why must I go abroad?</b>

361
00:26:58,889 --> 00:27:00,149
<b>I'm sorry,</b>

<b>but I don't trust you.</b>

<b>"Out of sight, out of mind."</b>

<b>I trust that more.</b>

365

<b>Right now, not seeing him will make you think you'll die,</b>

366
00:27:11,899 --> 00:27:15,399
<b>but I guarantee that you'll be over him in a month.</b>

367
00:27:16,139 --> 00:27:19,738
<b>Plus, you're majoring in classical music.</b>

368
00:27:20,439 --> 00:27:24,078
<b>Study in earnest in a bigger pond,</b>

<b>where the music came from.</b>

370
00:27:27,248 --> 00:27:29,318
<b>Since when did you care so much for me?</b>

371
00:27:30,248 --> 00:27:32,748
<b>Don't spend money on a daughter you're disappointed with...</b>

<b>and let me stay here.</b>

373
00:27:35,788 --> 00:27:37,919
<b>I don't want to go even if Chopin comes back to life.</b>

00:27:38,988 --> 00:27:41,429
<b>All you did so far was disappoint me.</b>

375
00:27:41,828 --> 00:27:44,028
<b>It's time you do as you're told.</b>

376
00:27:44,359 --> 00:27:46,728
<b>I might really die.</b>

377
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:48,828
<b>Too bad, then.</b>

378
00:27:56,578 --> 00:27:59,548
<b>Why come here when I want you to study?</b>

379
00:28:00,649 --> 00:28:01,909
<b>I don't want to go to lectures.</b>

380
00:28:02,149 --> 00:28:05,219
<b>Why? You used to live on campus.</b>

381
00:28:06,349 --> 00:28:08,548
<b>I can't stand the protesters.</b>

382
00:28:09,518 --> 00:28:11,859
<b>Why? What do they say?</b>

383
00:28:13,288 --> 00:28:15,859
<b>It's because they don't talk to me. They just whisper in secret.</b>

384
00:28:16,659 --> 00:28:18,099
<b>What do they say in secret?</b>

385
00:28:20,298 --> 00:28:22,099
<b>That I betrayed them over a girl.</b>

386
00:28:22,998 --> 00:28:24,768
<b>That's not true.</b>

387
00:28:25,709 --> 00:28:27,869
<b>I heard you broke up with that girl.</b>

388
00:28:30,838 --> 00:28:32,308
<b>Are you okay?</b>

389
00:28:34,248 --> 00:28:36,219
<b>I'm not going to school, so I can be okay.</b>

390
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:39,189
<b>If I go,</b>

391
00:28:40,788 --> 00:28:42,488
<b>I'll be reminded of her all the time.</b>

392
00:28:46,788 --> 00:28:47,788
<b>Ji Su.</b>

393
00:28:48,828 --> 00:28:50,429
<b>When you arrive at the airport in Frankfurt,</b>

394
00:28:50,429 --> 00:28:52,998
<b>you'll see a Korean man who will help you with your homestay.</b>

395
00:28:53,199 --> 00:28:55,328
<b>Ji Su, I heard he's really handsome.</b>

396
00:28:55,369 --> 00:28:56,639
<b>Good for you.</b>

397
00:28:56,639 --> 00:28:58,738
<b>What's the point of having a handsome house owner?</b>

398
00:28:58,738 --> 00:29:00,568
<b>- Not the house owner. - Ji Young.</b>

399
00:29:06,409 --> 00:29:07,409
<b>What are you talking about?</b>

400
00:29:07,409 --> 00:29:08,409
<b>What?</b>

401
00:29:08,409 --> 00:29:10,578
<b>- It's nothing. - Right.</b>

402
00:29:10,719 --> 00:29:11,949
<b>You'd better tell me.</b>

403
00:29:12,748 --> 00:29:14,719
<b>He's the youngest son of Sangguk Production's chairman.</b>

404
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:16,959
<b>We heard that the school he's going to isn't far from yours.</b>

405
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:18,419
<b>Is this the Joseon Dynasty?</b>

406
00:29:18,889 --> 00:29:20,258
<b>Do you want me to have an arranged marriage?</b>

407
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:22,328
<b>My gosh, you don't have to marry him.</b>

408
00:29:22,328 --> 00:29:25,429
<b>You can just go on a few dates with him.</b>

409
00:31:47,209 --> 00:31:48,308
<b>There you are!</b>

410
00:31:52,849 --> 00:31:53,879
<b>There you are.</b>

411
00:31:56,879 --> 00:31:57,949
<b>Yoon Ji Su.</b>

412
00:32:03,389 --> 00:32:05,588
<b>I wasn't sure if I should tell you or not.</b>

413
00:32:06,459 --> 00:32:09,129
<b>But I thought you should at least see her off.</b>

414
00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:12,298
<b>I heard it from Eun Dae.</b>

415
00:32:13,169 --> 00:32:16,298
<b>Ji Su is leaving Korea today.</b>

416
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:18,268
<b>To Germany to study.</b>

417
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:40,088
<b>But what's in Gangchon?</b>

418
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:42,818
<b>A senior student I know runs a guesthouse.</b>

419
00:33:43,789 --> 00:33:45,789
<b>I can just stay at your place.</b>

420
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:48,229
<b>If I were your parents,</b>

421
00:33:48,889 --> 00:33:50,929
<b>my house would be the first on the list.</b>

422
00:33:54,429 --> 00:33:56,738
<b>I think you can stay there for a few days.</b>

423
00:33:57,438 --> 00:33:59,369
<b>I need more than a few days.</b>

424
00:34:00,769 --> 00:34:02,309
<b>You won't go back home?</b>

425
00:34:02,809 --> 00:34:03,838
<b>No.</b>

426
00:34:04,108 --> 00:34:05,278
<b>What will you do?</b>

427
00:34:06,409 --> 00:34:08,008
<b>I want to marry you.</b>

428
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:31,639
<b>We should write one too.</b>

429
00:34:31,999 --> 00:34:33,008
<b>Write what?</b>

430
00:34:33,008 --> 00:34:35,539
<b>"Jae Hyun and Ji Su were here."</b>

431
00:34:36,378 --> 00:34:37,979
<b>Let's not do something like that.</b>

432
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,479
<b>I heard there are scribbles in Korean...</b>

433
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:42,349
<b>all over Heidelberg Palace in Germany.</b>

434
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:45,349
<b>Don't even bring up Germany.</b>

435
00:35:06,365 --> 00:35:07,965
<b>I think he's going to move.</b>

436
00:35:08,934 --> 00:35:10,334
<b>He's house-hunting.</b>

437
00:35:10,575 --> 00:35:11,635
<b>- House-hunting? - Yes.</b>

438
00:35:11,635 --> 00:35:13,845
<b>He's looking at houses on the outskirts of the city.</b>

439
00:35:14,305 --> 00:35:18,115
<b>And he's been taking his son when he goes to see the houses.</b>

440
00:35:18,244 --> 00:35:19,374
<b>Young Min?</b>

441
00:35:19,515 --> 00:35:21,544
<b>Yes. It looks like...</b>

442
00:35:21,785 --> 00:35:24,115
<b>they are going to live together.</b>

443
00:35:33,794 --> 00:35:35,124
<b>It hurts because of you.</b>

444
00:35:36,195 --> 00:35:37,334
<b>Because I like you.</b>

445
00:35:38,494 --> 00:35:39,564
<b>It's because...</b>

446
00:35:41,334 --> 00:35:42,635
<b>I like you.</b>

447
00:35:44,575 --> 00:35:46,035
<b>I'll give you time.</b>

448
00:35:46,905 --> 00:35:48,575
<b>Sort out whatever you must.</b>

449
00:35:48,774 --> 00:35:49,874
<b>Especially...</b>

450
00:35:50,974 --> 00:35:52,575
<b>any old relationships.</b>

451
00:35:53,515 --> 00:35:56,285
<b>Dad says this is where we'll live together.</b>

452
00:36:14,035 --> 00:36:15,505
<b>Nothing is easy.</b>

453
00:36:17,905 --> 00:36:18,974
<b>It's all right.</b>

454
00:36:20,044 --> 00:36:21,044
<b>It's okay.</b>

455
00:37:05,215 --> 00:37:06,584
<b>I think you're hurt.</b>

456
00:37:07,925 --> 00:37:09,124
<b>I fell.</b>

457
00:37:09,595 --> 00:37:10,595
<b>Are you okay?</b>

458
00:37:11,994 --> 00:37:13,195
<b>Yes, I'm okay.</b>

459
00:37:14,894 --> 00:37:16,465
<b>Why did you want to see me?</b>

460
00:37:16,635 --> 00:37:18,494
<b>I wanted to check something.</b>

461
00:37:20,965 --> 00:37:24,474
<b>I heard that your ex-husband petitioned to get the custody back.</b>

462
00:37:25,575 --> 00:37:28,005
<b>That's why you must have sent Dong Jin to me.</b>

463
00:37:28,005 --> 00:37:30,345
<b>I heard the lawsuit was dropped.</b>

464
00:37:31,314 --> 00:37:32,845
<b>Did he give up?</b>

465
00:37:33,814 --> 00:37:34,845
<b>No.</b>

466
00:37:37,814 --> 00:37:39,414
<b>We decided to get back together.</b>

467
00:37:50,235 --> 00:37:52,064
<b>Now, why would you make such a decision?</b>

468
00:37:57,035 --> 00:37:58,434
<b>To protect.</b>

469
00:37:59,704 --> 00:38:01,575
<b>To protect what?</b>

470
00:38:02,945 --> 00:38:04,075
<b>Young Min?</b>

471
00:38:05,115 --> 00:38:08,015
<b>Do you think that will truly protect your son?</b>

472
00:38:11,184 --> 00:38:13,255
<b>He needs his father at his age.</b>

473
00:38:14,055 --> 00:38:17,354
<b>As he's a boy, there's only so much I can do for him.</b>

474
00:38:19,454 --> 00:38:20,564
<b>I'll get going.</b>

475
00:38:26,334 --> 00:38:27,834
<b>Take care, Jae Hyun.</b>

476
00:38:30,505 --> 00:38:31,934

<b>It's not an inconvenience at all.</b>

<b>I only told the prosecutor in charge to follow the rules.</b>

<b>That's all.</b>

<b>Of course.</b>

517
00:41:43,024 --> 00:41:44,494
<b>I have a bad feeling about it.</b>

518
00:41:44,595 --> 00:41:46,064
<b>What do you mean?</b>

519
00:41:46,235 --> 00:41:48,064
<b>I think something is going wrong.</b>

531

<b>So I took it out and checked it out.</b>

<b>That won't be a drinking relay then.</b>

635
00:55:34,425 --> 00:55:37,095
<b>I think it's because we never properly said goodbye.</b>

636
00:55:38,294 --> 00:55:40,095
<b>So we need a proper farewell.</b>

637

<b>A complete goodbye.</b>

638

<b>I can't do that, Ji Su.</b>

<b>I want to protect it.</b>

640

<b>It's not because I feel bad...</b>

<b>or because I miss it,</b>

642
00:56:01,425 --> 00:56:04,325
<b>nor is it because of some hope.</b>

643
00:56:04,794 --> 00:56:06,555
<b>It's not "I wanted to protect it."</b>

644
00:56:08,394 --> 00:56:09,595
<b>I want to protect it.</b>

645
00:56:12,465 --> 00:56:13,834
<b>Because of that one desire.</b>

646
00:56:16,834 --> 00:56:18,374
<b>Just like you did.</b>

647

<b>I see you've been holding me captive without my noticing.</b>

653

<b>You should've been more careful if you were going to act like that.</b>
