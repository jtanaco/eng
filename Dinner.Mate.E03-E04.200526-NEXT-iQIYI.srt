Gosh, I'm hungry.

3
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:13,635
Maybe I should have bought
the chocolate earlier.

4
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:18,235
Speak of the devil.

5
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:24,475
How much is...

6
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:27,745
Sorry?

7
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:30,085
How much is what?

8
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,255
I thought you left.

9
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:36,655

[ Restaurants ]

00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,545
What should we eat? What could we get?

What should we eat?

All the restaurants I know are closed.

I'll look up restaurants that are open.

16

A lot of restaurants in Jeju Island
open 24 hours.

17
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,259
Places with scheduled
working hours are better.

18
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,469
The owner, chef, and staff
must be well-rested

19

You sounded like Baek Jong-won just now.

21
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:28,149
There are two restaurants.

22
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:30,079
One restaurant serves grilled sea bream.

23
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,645
- And
- What?

24
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,979
the other one serves abalone stew.

25
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:35,619
Well, that one is closer.

26
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,715
Can you forgive me?

27
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,285
Pardon?

28

Gosh. What are you doing?

29
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,565
I'm sorry, but look over there.

30

Don't tell me you want to eat there.

34
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:04,029
Can't you tell they'd serve great food?

35
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:06,899
I don't know about that.
But let's go to an indoor restaurant.

36
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,595
When it comes to picking restaurants,
I'm pretty good.

Set up the table. Set it up again!

42
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:27,285
- No, don't do that.
- Give me some food!

00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,459
- Welcome.
- We're open. Hello.

Welcome to our truck. A table for two?

45
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,455
Ma'am.

Wait. Do you really want to eat here?

00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:46,839
This place doesn't look that hygienic.
Let's go somewhere else.

- I won't serve you food.
- Hold on.

My apologies.

53
00:02:50,679 --> 00:02:54,149
Sir, don't you know that the better
a restaurant is, the shabbier it looks?

54
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,849
It's like a good stew restaurant that's
been around for 50 years is shabby.

55
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:58,249
- That's the vibe.
- That's our vibe.

56

Let's go. Okay? Let's go.

63
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:20,005
So the problem is that I have to choose
between black pork or sea urchins.

64
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,509
Both of them look good.

65
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:24,279
Let me tell you about the rice bowl
with Jeju black pork.

66
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,309
These pigs were raised
in the clean area of Jeju Island.

67
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,919
When you bite into it,
you'll taste how chewy it is.

68
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,215
And the juice from the meat
will explode in your mouth.

69
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,289
Right.

Let me tell you about the rice bowl
with sea urchins.

The savory flavor and soft texture
of sea urchins will wrap your tongue.

I want the rice bowl with sea urchins.

79
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,205
Right. Good choice.
The island is famous for that.

80
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:01,579
Give me the rice bowl with the pork belly.

81
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:05,149
All right. 1 rice bowl with pork belly
and 1 bibimbap with sea urchins.

82
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,415
Excellent choices.

83
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:09,285
All right. You can sit over there.

Gosh, I have a headache.

85
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:23,995
It's so good.

The savory flavor and soft texture
of sea urchins wrap my tongue.

87
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:31,005
I can literally taste the ocean with this.

88
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:32,545
Good.

89
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,245
It's just a rice bowl.
They're all the same.

90
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,235
How's yours?

91
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:04,905
What?

92
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:08,145

- Yes.

94
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,085

[ Isn't it normal to ask that first
as soon as I came back? ]

97
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,365
I can see you thinking,

98
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,105
"Why isn't she asking me why I came back?"
That's what it looks like.

99
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:40,605
I'm sorry.

100
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,245
I wasn't thinking that at all.

101
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:47,315
I didn't ask because it's pointless.

102
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,459
It's probably because
I looked so pathetic.

103
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:50,585
That's not it.

104
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,659
I can tell that you are
very educated and respectable.

105
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,195
And you seem to be well-off.

106
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,999
I understand. If you are emotionally
and financially comfortable,

107
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,165
you will feel sympathy for others.
That's natural.

108
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:05,039
Given the way you treat me and talk to me,

109
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,635
I don't think
you're considering me romantically.

110
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,179
So the chance of hitting on me
will be extremely low.

111
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:14,104
To be honest, I don't feel as awkward
around you

112
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,315
because I don't consider you
romantically either.

113
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:19,615
You sound like a psychiatrist.

114
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:22,859
My goodness, I hate psychiatrists.

115
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,955
When I listen to them,
they all sound like frauds.

116
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:28,055
Pardon?

117
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,825
Have you ever been scammed
by a psychiatrist?

118
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,469
Well, not really.

119
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:37,239
You're groundlessly criticizing
a profession.

120
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,665
That's an awful behavior.

121
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:44,139
Has a psychiatrist ever co-signed
a loan for you? You're covering for them.

122
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,705
That's not what I'm doing.

123
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:53,615
Let's just eat. Please eat.

124
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:56,815
Anyway,

125
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,025
today is a very special day.

126
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,329
And it should have been an awful day too.

127
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:05,965
Well, thanks to you,
it became a strange day.

128
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:08,865
By the way,

129
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,405
let's clarify one thing.

130
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:15,104
I didn't come back
because I felt bad for you.

131
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:19,745
I came back to have dinner with you.

132
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:30,315
Now that I'm full, I'm sleepy.

133
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,385
I should find a place to sleep.

134
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:35,825
If you don't have a reservation,
why don't you come with me?

135
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:39,229
When I'm here, I usually...

136
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:40,499
- Do you need a place?
- Goodness!

137
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,265
- You startled me. What is this?
- What?

138
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,669
Listen. A vacation house is
five minutes away from this place.

139
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:48,639
The moment you see it, you'll be
confused if it's a house or a palace.

140
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,979
This place comes with the most
luxurious interior design.

141
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:53,805
On top of that,
the linens are of the best quality.

142
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:56,779
There's a swimming pool
as big as a water park.

143
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,719
And the couple who owns the place
is so kind.

144
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,619
The whole town knows how nice they are.

145
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,785
Would you like to check it out?

146
00:08:06,889 --> 00:08:09,929
Should we check it out
since it's close and nice?

147
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,229
- No.
- Write down the address.

148
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:13,864
- All right.
- You made the right decision.

149
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,795
I thought you were here for dinner.
Now, you need a place to stay?

150
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,935
Aren't they kind of weird?

151
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:52,209
- Hello.
- My goodness. There's a granny.

152
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:53,535
Welcome.

153
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:01,615
My goodness, your outfit...

154
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,685
So tell me.

155
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:08,615
Do you want a room with a bed
or without the bed?

156
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,015
Pardon?

157
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:14,959
It looks like the lady isn't from here.

158
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,429
But you... Wait. Are you from Hamdeok?

I'm from Seoul.

I'm here on a business trip.

How about a room with a hot tub?

164
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:29,475
No, we want two rooms.
We'll be sleeping separately.

165

Well, that's what everyone says at first.

Once you book two rooms,

Yes.

I don't want to have meals with people
whom I'm not close with.

180

And if I'm eating with a stranger,

181
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:42,175
it means I probably want to be
on that person's side.

I'll smack that person.

00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:25,189
And

486
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:27,619
he has also done some podcasts before.

487
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:29,255
[ The act of eating itself ]

488
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:32,085
[ can be analyzed and interpreted
in many ways. ]

489
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:34,359
- His voice.
[ - A psychiatrist like me needs to think, ]

490
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,925
He's golden.

491
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:39,835
[ but it's most ideal to eat
without anything on your mind. ]

492
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:42,399
[ What I tell my patients the most is ]

493
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,169
[ nothing surprising,
but to enjoy their food. ]

494
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:47,509
[ They could be enjoying their food
because it's really good. ]

495
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:49,579
[ Or they could be enjoying it
because of good company. ]

496
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:52,375
[ I hope all my listeners
enjoy their meals today too. ]

497
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,679
He's hot.

498
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:57,188
- Piping hot, for real.
- Goodness.

499
00:33:57,189 --> 00:34:00,188
I heard he's such a smooth talker.

500
00:34:00,189 --> 00:34:01,559
Then why wouldn't he go on shows?

501
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:04,784
Who knows? Everyone wants him,
but I guess he refuses all the offers.

502
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,925
Is he

503
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,929
a pervert or psycho by any chance?

504
00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:12,265
So what? We just need a hit with him.

505
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:16,069
Let me get this straight. You want
to birth a new trend of sapiosexuals?

506
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:19,009
Right, Jeong-hwan contacted him for now,

507
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:20,505
so make sure you get Dr. Kim.

508
00:34:22,039 --> 00:34:23,675
You know what?

509
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:26,975
This project requires a lot of tough work.

510
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,719
I wonder if there are any bonuses.

511
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,219
Your monthly rent.

512
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:33,288
Monthly rent is nothing
compared to the work this requires.

513
00:34:33,289 --> 00:34:35,455
Look at you getting down to business.

514
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:36,955
What do you want?

515
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:39,625
If I succeed in casting him
and make it a hit,

516
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:42,865
I get to design a project I want to do.

517
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:44,629
- You!
- You're also giving me this job

518
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:46,539
because you know I'm fit to do it.

519
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:49,095
Goodness, you sneaky fox.

520
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:54,175
I'll get him sitting
right there inside our studio.

521
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:56,805
How does that sound?

522
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:59,045
Fine.

523
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,719
What did you say?

524
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,989
I can't hear you.

525
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:05,289
What is it that you said?

526
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:06,485
Fine!

527
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:11,959
I'll get him sitting right there.

528
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,095
Do it again.

529
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,825
I got you.

530
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,665
Catch him like this, okay?

531
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:20,595
- Get him.
- Okay. Let go of me!

532
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:26,339
- Can you check this?
- Yes, sir.

533
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:28,039
What happened to Patient Ko Ji-hwan?

534
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,309
Oh, he's on his way back
after getting caught

535
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:31,545
at the bus terminal.

536
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:32,945
Is that right?

537
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,975
He's run away so many times already.

538
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:39,145
What are you watching?

539
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:40,989
- What?
- You're watching something skanky.

540
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:42,685
No, I'm not.

541
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,389
There's an MCN company called 2N BOX,

542
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:46,699
and they wanted to cast you.

543
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,225
I said no for now,

544
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:50,725
and I'm now checking
the contents they make.

545
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:52,165
Take a look at this.

546
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,539
Gosh, his hair...

547
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:56,099
[ - My goodness.
- I'll pluck all of your hair. ]

548
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:58,369
[ - Hey, it's my hair.
- I'll pluck every single strand. ]

549
00:35:58,370 --> 00:36:00,139
It's a terribly poor MCN company.

550
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:02,209
- Both look like psychos.
[ - I'll pluck all of your hair. ]

551
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:04,505
[ Hey, it's my hair. You started first. ]

552
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:07,715
I think the people who designed
this program are the ones insane.

553
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,789
That obsession
that they have to be different.

554
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:11,385
Lack of altruism

555
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:12,885
and a tendency of violence.

556
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,155
Those types of people are more dangerous
than psychopaths.

557
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:17,885
They are kind of like you.

558
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,625
Like me?

559
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,969
These people are ruining this planet,

560
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:28,395
- and I'm like them?
[ - Good work. ]

561
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:32,065
- I'm sorry.
[ - He rejected us ]

562
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,735
at once.

563
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:35,839
At once?

564
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:38,509
He treated me as if I was a spam call
selling insurance.

565
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:40,275
Did you talk to Dr. Kim himself?

566
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:42,815
No. It was his assistant
who's also a nurse.

567
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:44,745
Give me his number.

568
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:52,255
Oh, yes. Hello.

569
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,529
You're the producer of the show?

570

[ Why don't you at least listen to... ]

571
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:58,525
No, thanks.

572
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:00,465
I've already said no.

573
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:02,639
We make different contents

574
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,639
apart from any public, cable,
and subscription network.

575
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,939
[ I am sure Dr. Kim will be
deeply interested... ]

576
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:08,079
We're not interested.

577
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,209
Dr. Kim will not make an appearance
on that kind of show.

578
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:12,145
I will hang up in three.

579
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:14,149
- Three.
- Darn you!

580
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:15,445
You didn't count from one!

581
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:18,645
I told you.

582
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:20,285
What?

583
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,925
"That kind of show"?

584
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:29,055
How dare you test my grit, you punk.

585
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,895
You don't know Dr. Kim's number, right?

586
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:35,035
No. But I do have his email address.

587
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:38,535
Email address...

588
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,015
- I'm off.
- Goodness.

589
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,515
Are you heading to your dinner counseling?

590
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:54,315
Yes. What are you doing?

591
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,159
We got a wrong package here.

592
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,555
You shopped again, didn't you?

593
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:00,155
No.

594
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,725
What do you buy online all the time?

595
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:03,465
- Let me see what it is.
- It's not ours.

596
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:05,829
- It's a misdelivery.
- What do you shop all-day?

597
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:07,695
[ Written by Lee Mun-jeong ]

Did you order these?

599
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:20,445
- No.
- Then who did?

600
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:24,785
Did you give the hospital address
to Writer Lee Mun-jeong?

601
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,985
Who told you to do so?

602
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:33,625
Well, she said
she would like to send me these, so...

603
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,525
Throw them away.

604
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:40,469
But there are 20 of them. How can I...

605
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:42,465
Then sell them online or something!

606
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:48,935
Why is he mad at me?

607
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:51,005

He opened it.

613

Hello?

614
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,559
[ You got a parcel.
Are you at home right now? ]

615
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:38,855
No, I'm not.
Please put it in the parcel drop box.

616
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:41,795
Well, I don't think it will fit in.

617
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:46,939
May I ask who sent the parcel?

618
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:48,395
[ Mr. Lee Yeong-dong, it says. ]

619
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:52,235
Okay.

620
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:03,249
I went to department stores and
supermarkets and did what you said.

621
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:06,419
With earphones on,
I listened to music loudly

622
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:08,655
and walked in the stores
while looking at my shopping list.

623
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:12,055
Then I found myself
buying only the things I need.

624
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,925
It was a fascinating experience.

625
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:19,395
I guess then you can now
pay more attention to your son.

626
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:22,695
Because you couldn't during the therapy.

627
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:24,735
I guess that's true.

628
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,935
But I would like to care less
about my son for the time being.

629
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:30,605
Not only because of the therapy
but also because of my work.

630
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,915

631

Not all women
have the maternal instinct after all.

Excuse me?
