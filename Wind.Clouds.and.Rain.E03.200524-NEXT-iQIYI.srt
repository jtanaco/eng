<i>Episode 3</i>

2
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:00,110
What are those flowers?

3
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,980
Plume blossoms, my Lord.

4
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:11,250
Spring... is upon us.

5
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:18,730
Lord?

6
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,530
My Lord! My Lord!

7
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:26,830
What are you waiting for!
Call for the doctor!

8
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,100
My Lord! My Lord!

9
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,780
<i>Queen Jo
Queen Mother Hyoyu</i>

10
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:47,120
How many people witnessed
our Majesty collapse, today?

11
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,060
Everyone has been silenced,
Queen Mother.

12
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:53,030
If anyone finds out,

13
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,530
I will have every single
one of your heads.

14
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:57,930
Yes, Queen Mother.

15
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:16,720
Doctor your diagnosis?
How is our King's condition?

16
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:20,050
A tumor on his back
combined with a cold chest.

17
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,320
Our King will not even be able to stand.

18
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:25,190
<i>Haok Jwa-Keun Kim
Prime Minister</i>

19
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,930
Such a shame.

20
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,470
Send him our highest quality
wild ginsengs.

21
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,400
Yes, Father.

22
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:40,570
I will deliver the ginsengs to the Princess
to present to the King.

23
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,110
Good.

24
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,640
<i>Father...</i>

25
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,910
<i>it hurts see you like this...</i>

26
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:15,540
Did the Lord Byung-Woon Haoak
send you to spy on the King?

27
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,310
No, Ma'am

28
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,310
How dare I do such a thing.

29
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:24,720
You must always watch your mouth.

30
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:26,720
Yes, Queen Mother.

31
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,560
Your princess status was discovered
by the 'Jangdong Kim-Moon' Family

32
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:32,430
but a person of the Kingdom.

33
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,430
Never forget that
but you are of royalty.

34
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,630
Yes, Ma'am.

35
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:49,810
<i>Give me rice soup, rice soup!</i>

36
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:58,320
Wait a second...

37
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:00,520
aren't you?

38
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:02,620
My savior! My hero!

39
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,400
Yesterday, I saved you
from the Kim-Moon thugs!

40
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:13,830
Great to meet you!
My name is Pal-Yong, Yong Pal-Yong.

41
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,900
Backwards it's Yong-Pal-Yong.

42
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:19,210
Forwards it's Yong-Pal-Yong.

43
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,510
Yong-Pal-Yong-Pal-Yong-Pal-Yong.

44
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,810
Pal-Yong-Pal-Yong-Pal-Yong-Pal.

45
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:23,510
Easy right? Here.

46
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:28,150
A man of few words, like a hero.

47
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,920
We can get to know
each other slowly.

48
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:34,320
Here, have some sweet rice tea.

49
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:36,360
I did not order this.

50
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:38,830
It's on me, drink.

51
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:45,570
So handsome,
like my younger brother.

52
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,030
What are you doing?

53
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:49,600
Are you discriminating!

54
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:51,910
How many others are here!

55
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,210
Just piss off, will you?

56
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:01,550
Stop loitering around our tavern!

57
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:05,620
For 10 years you couldn't pass
the state exam!

58
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:08,120
Just give up and go back
to your hometown!

59
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:10,160
You idiot!

60
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:14,460
You're going to regret
treating me like this!

61
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,730
When I pass the state exams,

62
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,930
I will never return,
even if you beg me to!

63
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:27,010
Please, have some tea.

64
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,310
<i>Give me rice soup, rice soup!</i>

65
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,310
In a hurry?

66
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:43,820
A little...

67
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:45,820
Darn you!

68
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:04,510
A real big hurry?

69
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,210
Um... it's...

70
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,730
My apologies! I'm sorry!

71
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,930
Oh, God, I'm sorry!

72
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,930
I'm sorry!

73
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:51,320
My nose!

74
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:03,900
<i>A secret to Fame and Fortune</i>

75
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,740
<i>There are no paths there...</i>

76
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:13,510
<i>Yes, Master... No paths at all...</i>

77
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,110
I don't know...

78
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,620
how I should live anymore.

79
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:31,730
What destiny holds for those scoundrels
that made you like this,

80
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:36,830
what path you must take
your father's unjust murder...

81
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,470
Focus on all of these things.

82
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:45,510
This cliff has ended this path
create your own.

83
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,310
<i>That woman, your soul mate,
was also</i>

84
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,410
<i>destined to lose her lover.</i>

85
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:58,190
<i>But now that you live
everything has changed.</i>

86
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:04,360
Why don't you create
your own destiny!

87
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,380
<i>Creating a new path where a path ends.</i>

88
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:33,320
Chun-Jung, remember my words!

89
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:36,320
Do not ever avenge me!

90
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:39,190
Lower your head and
live in secrecy.

91
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,530
You must keep your life!

92
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,830
Father!

93
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,610
Once he arrives,
a fair investigation will reveal the truth.

94
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,620
We have no evidence.

95
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:03,120
You have a witness.

96
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:06,820
I saw everything unfold haven't I?

97
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:11,830
Thank you. Bong-Ryun

98
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,530
Explain yourself.

99
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:17,030
Why was there gun powder
on the cargo vessel?

100
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,530
I do not know
what he is talking about.

101
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:28,180
I witnessed Gyung Choi and his men
move gun powder onto the ship.

102
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:37,220
Are you always enraged?

103
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:40,020
Maybe your father was trying to
suppress all of your rage.

104
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:41,920
That isn't it.

105
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:43,690
It's just...

106
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:47,130
Why would Bong-Ryun betray me?

107
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,830
This question is stuck in my head.

108
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:55,200
It was to prevent you
from an untimely death.

109
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:58,610
If you cannot forget her
and seek after her

110
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:03,880
she will kill you
and complete her destiny.

111
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,920
You must let go.

112
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:11,620
<i>Yes, master.</i>

113
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:14,020
<i>I will wait patiently,</i>

114
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:16,020
<i>and never forget...</i>

115
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:18,830
<i>I will avenge my father's death.</i>

116
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,430
<i>Where the path ends,</i>

117
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:26,230
<i>I will create my own destiny!</i>

118
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:45,990
As if to brand a cow or pig!

119
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,250
<i>Jajahyung
Branding a criminal’s face or arm</i>

120
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:50,420
How dare they scar
your noble body!

121
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,530
It's alright.

122
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,730
It does not hurt anymore.

123
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,710
Let go! Stop!

124
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:23,520
Going through such pain
to save Lord Chun-Jung,

125
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:26,190
do you think he knows?

126
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,330
It does not matter.

127
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,930
As long as he is alive.

128
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:39,110
Oh, right!

129
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,010
Miss, these were posted on
all ports throughout the country.

130
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:50,820
But no one has yet to reach out
about your mother.

131
00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:01,030
Could it be my memory fading?

132
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,630
Sometimes it's hard to remember
her face.

133
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:09,040
No, Ma'am! I asked the servant,
Mr. Jang, and he said

134
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:11,510
She looks just like this!

135
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:23,920
My Lord!

136
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,920
What brings you here?

137
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:32,830
I just really miss my daughter!

138
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:37,730
Is she happy? Is she healthy?

139
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,430
Please let me just see her!

140
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,170
Don't worry.

141
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:44,810
His Majesty has prepared
an orderly residents for you.

142
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,510
You will be escorted there.

143
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,110
Please, sir!

144
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:54,610
She cannot even sleep properly
without me.

145
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:58,420
She is still a child
who should be with her mother.

146
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:01,020
She is not your daughter,
she is a princess.

147
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:04,620
Everyone here is treating her
as royalty.

148
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:07,930
Mother! Mother!

149
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:10,730
The princess has already
forgotten you,

150
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:13,130
and sleeps well with silk blankets.

151
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,100
Is that true?

152
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,310
Take her.

153
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,710
Yes, sir.

154
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,110
My Lord!

155
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,610
My Lord, is that true?

156
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:28,820
Mother!

157
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:31,620
Bong-Ryun!

158
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:36,020
Mother!

159
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,010
Mother...

160
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:59,310
Mother... Mother...

161
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,310
How is the King?

162
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,580
When will he pass?

163
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:42,420
It is up to the heavens.

164
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:47,530
Today, tomorrow? I do not know.

165
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,430
Trying to protect him?
Since he is still your father?

166
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:56,500
I acknowledge your hard work.

167
00:15:56,910 --> 00:16:00,010
If you do well once more,
you will be greatly rewarded.

168
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,510
Once more?

169
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:08,250
Do you think you can find
the next Young Lord of Ganghwa?

170
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,720
the next Lord of Ganghwa...

171
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:21,030
Are you looking for someone
with the potential to be King?

172
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:33,910
The next King you say...

173
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,810
I will find him...

174
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,910
I will do whatever it takes.

175
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:45,590
Move! Move aside!

176
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,320
You'll get hurt!

177
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,630
Move! Move aside!

178
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:04,900
Let me through!

179
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,510
Hey!

180
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,910
What? What!

181
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:15,720
In a hurry again?

182
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:17,820
As if running
from the East Sea to the West?

183
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:20,120
I am four months
overdue at the tavern!

184
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,720
I know my way
around this neighborhood,

185
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:24,120
I'm working all odd jobs
to make some money.

186
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:27,190
Why don't you just steal from
this neighborhood?

187
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:29,930
Come on now...

188
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:34,630
Listen, that really was
a one time deal

189
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,300
I'm not that kind of a person

190
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:40,610
Let's just move on with it, huh?

191
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:44,500
I'm sorry! I’m sorry!

192
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,600
Forgive me! Let me live!

193
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:51,120
If you know this area so well,

194
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:53,250
why don't you run
a few errands for me?

195
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:57,020
Huh?

196
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:03,630
The Red Monk!

197
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:08,500
He is the most popular fortune teller
in Han Yang!

198
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:09,800
Red Monk?

199
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:11,810
He always wears a red cape.

200
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,640
His readings are
said to be very accurate!

201
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:19,550
Why? Your life is
in need of some good fortune?

202
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,850
Maybe... But just curious.

203
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:24,820
About?

204
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:29,890
How big my potential is.
Nothing much.

205
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:47,510
There is a virgin ghost
among your ancestors

206
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,380
You're going to die alone!

207
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:54,610
I'm already getting old,
but forever?

208
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:59,350
That is what your palm says,
but give me your birth date.

209
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:04,320
Yeah, so... a few days
before I was born,

210
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:06,630
there was a fire
in the grain deposits,

211
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,830
which would make my birth date...

212
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,530
the sixteenth!

213
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:14,500
the sixteenth...
that is all I know.

214
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:18,300
How can I read properly
if you don't know your birth date?

215
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:28,520
Listen! Just sleep with
this in your pillow.

216
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:32,420
Then men will line up for you!

217
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:35,120
Oh my!

218
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:39,130
How much is this?

219
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,430
A measly 100 coins

220
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,230
a... hundred?

221
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:45,730
Please give me a better deal

222
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,330
Do you want to die alone?

223
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,600
Please, just a little bit...

224
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:53,510
By any chance,
was that fire by the river?

225
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,710
Who are you?
How'd you know?

226
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:05,050
I mean, how do you know this, sir?

227
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:08,890
According to history,
During King Sunjo's reign in March,

228
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:09,960
<i>Jobo
Official newspaper</i>

229
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:13,630
You are born the year of the snake,
second week of May.

230
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:18,030
Your readings are hot
but this year is cold with water...

231
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:21,430
Hasn't a man related to
the seas approached you recently?

232
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,840
Water...

233
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:24,200
Water you say...

234
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:26,110
water, water...

235
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:29,610
Oh! Oh my! Oh!

236
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:32,810
The water boy! Mr. Sim!
He has been coming on to me!

237
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,010
Who are you!

238
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:37,820
He is your soul mate,
try to make things work with him.

239
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:40,920
Do not waste your money
with such a fraud!

240
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:45,160
Yes. Thank you, master!

241
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:48,030
How dare you call me a fraud!

242
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,330
- You!
- Yes?

243
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,630
Hey!

244
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,470
How can a beauty like me
be destined to die alone?

245
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,300
You want to palm read this?

246
00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:00,810
Thanks for this though...

247
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,610
That cost 100... coins...

248
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,310
This guy is a complete crook.

249
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,310
A snake at best!

250
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,520
Trying to cheat good people.

251
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:12,820
What? Huh?

252
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:17,220
You are a masterful fortune teller!

253
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:19,530
Please, excuse me, master.

254
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,860
She can't just...

255
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:24,430
It appears I have ruined
your business.

256
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,730
In exchange, let me read your future.

257
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,240
What? Get him!

258
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:31,200
I see your ears have blackened.

259
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:33,810
You have experienced
blistering winter winds.

260
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:36,240
Your thumbs and hands
are of a boat man.

261
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,880
The scars around your throat...

262
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:40,650
Remnants of a chain I assume.

263
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:43,750
A warship's slave.

264
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:46,750
Correct?

265
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:49,120
How, how did he...!

266
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,030
Hey! Get out!

267
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:08,710
Although you act like a scum
you are very smart and crafty

268
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,810
I assume you're born
in the year of the monkey?

269
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:17,220
Good at manipulating others,
so May? Right?

270
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:23,160
Only my mother knows
my real birth date...

271
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:29,900
Do you know my mother...?

272
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,330
How would I know your mother.

273
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:34,130
Oh! my Master!

274
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:38,510
I was born 1884, days of the black monkey,
time of the white rat!

275
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:42,010
Nothing has been working out
for me lately!

276
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,310
How will this year be for...

277
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,410
You, becareful of the seas.

278
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,820
Especially this month,
stay away from water.

279
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:54,220
Recently, I was caught
under heavy rain,

280
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:56,820
for days, I lay sick!

281
00:22:56,930 --> 00:23:00,330
The doctors told me
I should have died, but I was lucky!

282
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,330
You are lucky thus far but,

283
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:07,130
you must be more careful,
your life depends on it.

284
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,500
My life?

285
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:13,210
Master! Help me!

286
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:16,340
I am but a poor lowly man!

287
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:21,810
I lost my father
at a young age and...

288
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:23,920
never met the right woman...

289
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:27,590
I've spent my life all by myself...

290
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,020
Brother, he's gone...

291
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:33,530
He left? He left?

292
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:36,430
Everyone left?
Yup, everyone.

293
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,930
Master! Master!

294
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:44,100
That was amazing, master!

295
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:46,810
Master?
I am no such thing

296
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:51,880
Thanks to you man,
I mean thanks to you master,

297
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:55,720
I remembered I, Pal-Yong,
did not come to Han Yang

298
00:23:56,030 --> 00:24:00,420
to work these petty jobs
and live day by day.

299
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:04,090
I should aim for better things
and bet big!

300
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,730
Bet big? Where?

301
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:19,010
Oh, God, It's my time!

302
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:30,720
I have the best luck today!

303
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:33,420
Nice, nice! Let us play!

304
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,560
<i>Investigate Lord Heungseon-gun's
recent activities.</i>

305
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:38,420
The King has fallen ill,

306
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:42,130
royal families
will begin to seek power.

307
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:47,630
Figure out
who he has been meeting,

308
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:51,100
what he's been doing, watch him carefully.

309
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:06,990
This is our Baeohgae's
famous spectacle!

310
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:10,220
That kid,
he's a brother of the tavern lady!

311
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:14,430
Wow, the states are high!

312
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,030
Have a look.

313
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,830
Now, show your hands please

314
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:50,230
High five!

315
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,830
High eight.

316
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,140
So intense!

317
00:25:56,410 --> 00:25:59,240
Noble sir, what is your hand?

318
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:16,720
I have...

319
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:19,930
double nines!

320
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:26,530
I win again...

321
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,540
You move impatiently, my Lord.

322
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:31,500
1, 2, 7 and...

323
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,710
double tens!

324
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,710
Double tens?

325
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,620
Not possible, I had one of the tens!

326
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:48,720
My Lord, your eye sight
is darkening so quickly!

327
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,930
You filthy cheater!

328
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:57,930
Come here you brat!
You thief!

329
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:00,730
You cheating thief!

330
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,510
You're quite large...

331
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:18,020
Arrest these gamblers!

332
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,320
Where do you think you're going!

333
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:51,820
Please forgive me!

334
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:53,520
I was just watching!
Let's go!

335
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:56,320
I was just looking...

336
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,130
Follow me.

337
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:03,230
Hold on...

338
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:07,530
Wait!

339
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,810
Lieutenant!

340
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,910
What brings you here?

341
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,010
I had some business.

342
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,730
<i>He cannot remember me.</i>

343
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:41,630
<i>What a remarkable face.</i>

344
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:44,000
<i>His eyes glow in the dark.</i>

345
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:47,410
<i>A high prominent nose.</i>

346
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,010
<i>This man...</i>

347
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,310
<i>Has the features of a tiger!</i>

348
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:56,420
We're safe,
no one’s following us!

349
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:06,030
Well...

350
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:11,730
For saving my life.

351
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:18,400
I'm alright.

352
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:20,610
Take it, it's fine!

353
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:30,480
Why are you staring at me
so hard.

354
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:35,620
My apologies.
You have rare glowing eyes.

355
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:38,420
Glowing eyes?

356
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,700
I have eyes that glow
like a tiger's?

357
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:46,330
Are you some sort of
fortune teller?

358
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:50,040
You must be very talented!

359
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:51,700
Let's see...

360
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:56,110
So back at the gambling house,

361
00:29:56,120 --> 00:30:00,210
you noticed my eyes
blinking and glowing?

362
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:02,110
No sir.

363
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:07,120
A true tiger would hide his eyes
at such a pitiful place.

364
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,330
You were constantly watching me
back there huh?

365
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,500
I am Ha-Eung Lee.

366
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:26,910
I am...

367
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:31,910
Mu-Myung Choi

368
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,210
Mu-Myung you say...

369
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:38,720
Can't be your real name...

370
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:41,750
you must have had quite a life?

371
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:48,830
If fate has it,
let us meet again!

372
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,830
I will leave now.

373
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,430
Goodbye.

374
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:25,030
Extra precautions, for this writing
will be hung at a Seowon.

375
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,470
<i>Seowon(Library)</i>

376
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:33,010
I appreciate you coming
at such an hour.

377
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:37,710
I've spent a long time
in Ganghwa Island and

378
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,810
I don't have many relatives,

379
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:44,420
and none whom
I am comfortable with.

380
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:46,720
My gratitude, Your Majesty.

381
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:49,990
Please summon me anytime.

382
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:53,390
How is my writing?

383
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,430
My King,

384
00:31:57,570 --> 00:31:59,530
you mustn't write this.

385
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:05,100
There are many Seowons across the nation,
which ever receives

386
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:09,510
a writing from the King himself,
will have power over the others.

387
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,310
Did you know this?

388
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:19,820
I have ears to listen,
of course I understand the effects.

389
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:25,520
But, Jwa-Keun Kim has requested,

390
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,930
how could I turn him down?

391
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:36,500
I have ears to listen,

392
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:39,710
but have lost the mouth

393
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,010
to say no.

394
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,520
I shall rewrite this.

395
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:57,620
Tomorrow the Minister of Finance,
Byung-Woon Kim

396
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:18,610
<i>Nahab (Jwa-Keun Kim’s concubine)</i>

397
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:34,330
We pray to
the dragon king of the seas,

398
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:41,830
take our humble offerings

399
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:47,310
and give us
wealth, fame, and respect!

400
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:52,010
Provide the unfortunate with luck,

401
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:56,320
lengthen our lives,

402
00:33:56,330 --> 00:34:00,650
heal the sick,

403
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:05,020
guide the dead to the heavens.

404
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:13,630
Lead our Jangdong Kim-Moon
Family to eternity!

405
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:17,100
Bring us great fortune and wealth!

406
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:36,820
Look at all that white rice!

407
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:39,020
They're feeding all that to the fish?

408
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:40,530
All that precious rice!

409
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:43,530
Our ives are worth less than
those fish.

410
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:47,930
That Kim-Moon Family
has gone mad with riches!

411
00:34:47,930 --> 00:34:50,240
The people are starving to death!

412
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,120
How do they have so much?

413
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:29,610
Please stop brother!

414
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:33,710
You don't see the pile of money?
Come on, hurry.

415
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:37,220
Did you not listen to
the strange master earlier?

416
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:38,220
He warned you about water.

417
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:41,720
Do you know how much we lost
because of that daylight demon?

418
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:44,220
Think of all those people
I paid to stand outside!

419
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:47,860
You paid them?
What about us?

420
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:49,630
Hurry up,
we don't have time.

421
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,230
- Brother.
- What!

422
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,130
You don't know how to swim!

423
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,940
If we don't steal it,
someone might steal it before us!

424
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:58,400
I said hurry up!
You're driving me crazy brother!

425
00:35:58,410 --> 00:35:59,910
You don't have to hit me...

426
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,910
You aren't coming?

427
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,610
Leave!
Leave me then you idiots!

428
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,510
Fine, we're really leaving!

429
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:09,010
Let's go for a bowl of soup.
Yeah, sounds good.

430
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:11,620
Really? You're really leaving?
Do you have any loyalty!

431
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:17,920
Becareful of water,
becareful of water...

432
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:24,330
Becareful of water...

433
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,600
It's freezing!

434
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:36,410
<i>What is that!</i>

435
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:37,410
<i>Someone went in.</i>

436
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:38,510
<i>He's going for the money?</i>

437
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,030
<i>What a waste.</i>

438
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,610
<i>What are you waiting for!</i>

439
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:10,110
Can't you see him!

440
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,410
Someone do something!

441
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:19,920
Handle this!

442
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,830
Becareful of water...

443
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,500
Come here!

444
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,830
He ruined the ritual
for the dragon king.

445
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,030
Give him a harsh penalty!

446
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,030
Yes, Ma'am!

447
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:15,110
I don't care if he dies.
Beat him!

448
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,610
Yes, sir!

449
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,620
Watch carefully!

450
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:27,120
Anyone who messes
with the 'Jangdong Kim-Moon' Family

451
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:30,420
Stop!

452
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:44,200
The money and rice
you have squandered

453
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:49,410
Yet the 'Jangdong Kim-Moon' Family
rather feed fish?

454
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:52,610
And try to stomp and
kill our people like insects?

455
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,510
Do you not fear the heavens!

456
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,420
Do you not fear our people!

457
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:59,280
He's right!

458
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:04,490
He’s right!

459
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:08,830
He’s right!

460
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,230
Alright then.

461
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:14,630
We shall let him live,
please calm down!

462
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:19,300
- Let's go
- Yes, sir!

463
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:36,190
Daylight demon...

464
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:37,720
Becareful of water...

465
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:40,530
Come on, I got you.

466
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,330
Thank goodness!

467
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:50,500
Amazing!

468
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:58,210
Thank you.

469
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:07,020
Thank you.

470
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,130
Here.

471
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:15,930
Thank you

472
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:22,730
Do you think you can find
the next Young Lord of Ganghwa?

473
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:27,510
<i>None of them
are King worthy material</i>

474
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:31,310
<i>You little child thief!</i>

475
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,810
<i>I am not a thief!</i>

476
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:34,910
Someone threw it away!

477
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,520
Big excuses!

478
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:44,920
Let it be.

479
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:48,530
Let the child have some food
left over from the feast.

480
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,530
Take it.

481
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:55,130
I have my reasons
for my actions...

482
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:59,000
But still, I will not forget
your grace.

483
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:29,840
<i>It's must be that child.</i>

484
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:32,500
<i>The child with fiery eyes...</i>

485
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:36,910
<i>True king's potential
is within that girl!</i>

486
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:55,260
<i>Ja-Young Min
Future Empress Myeongseong</i>

487
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:08,110
Here you are!

488
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:11,010
Please come with me.
To where?

489
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:13,210
You will find out,
please follow me.

490
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:15,610
This way.

491
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:22,120
The hero who saved
the citizen by the river!

492

Baeohgae's new rising Master!

493
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:29,230
Master Choi, this way!

494
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:33,530
This way, please, we're almost there.

495
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:35,430
This is the man!

496
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:39,910
He predicted my future to perfection!

497
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,010
Grettings.

498
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:42,510
Applause!

499
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,810
Applause!

500
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:46,810
How much for his readings?

501
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:48,810
His readings...

502
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:53,120
three coins per, two for you,
one for me, yes or no?

503
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:54,950
Huh? What!

504
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:57,620
Insufficient? Then I want free boarding
at the tavern, indefinitely

505
00:42:57,630 --> 00:42:59,520
I can conceive a deal with
the tavern lady.

506
00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:01,030
It wouldn't be so bad
for her either.

507
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,330
Of course!

508
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:03,530
Yes or no?

509
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:07,130
Indefinitely...

510
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:10,340
free... housing?

511
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:16,840
Three coins per person!

512
00:43:16,850 --> 00:43:18,940
Make a line!
Make a line!

513
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,720
What are you waiting for?
Come in, please!

514
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:31,690
<i>Please pay back what you owe.</i>

515
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:35,530
My father worked hard for
that money before he passed.

516
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:38,330
I paid for his funeral fees,

517
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:42,330
I paid for his body to be prepared
and his grave to be dug, no?

518
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,600
I do appreciate that

519
00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:47,110
but preparing the body cost
eight coins,

520
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:48,910
and six coins
for the grave diggers,

521
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:51,810
I remember correctly, right?

522
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:53,210
Hmm?

523
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:55,910
I'm not sure.

524
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,520
Call forth the workers
and let us confirm.

525
00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:00,420
They will agree with me.

526
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:05,220
My father has more than
one hundred coins to be paid back.

527
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:09,930
How dare a child talk back
to an adult like this!

528
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:12,730
Our family has lost it's pillar,

529
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:16,130
I do not ask for
your pitty or sorrows,

530
00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:19,600
But I expect you to behave
like a man not a lowly thief.

531
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:21,410
Why you...!

532
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:26,210
Jayoung, why don't you
help me in the kitchen.

533
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:28,310
Help the family servants,

534
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:31,520
with your efforts I promise

535
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:33,920
to pay your hundred coins back.

536
00:44:36,830 --> 00:44:39,320
Our family is poor of
materialistic things,

537
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:43,530
but it seems your family
is poor of heart and brains.

538
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:45,930
Have I ever seen such a brat!

539
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:48,230
I will be back
for my father's money.

540
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:53,310
But, I will not listen to your lies
and excuses disguised as empathy.

541
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:56,410
So please stop talking.

542
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:01,410
Come and throw some salt at her!

543
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:03,820
<i>Miss!</i>

544
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:09,050
The little child thief,
I looked into her.

545
00:45:09,730 --> 00:45:10,720
Who is she?

546
00:45:10,730 --> 00:45:12,820
She is a servant working
at the Wallsong-ru Concubine house.

547
00:45:12,830 --> 00:45:14,690
No one knows her name or address.

548
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:17,600
Is that so?

549
00:45:17,610 --> 00:45:19,830
I will leave a message
at Wallsong-ru,

550
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:21,400
to bring the child here upon sight.

551
00:45:22,510 --> 00:45:25,800
No, Do not send anyone
to Wallsong-ru.

552
00:45:26,650 --> 00:45:31,310
If Byung-Woon Kim finds out about her,
he will look into all of our affairs.

553
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:36,680
Bring me a Concubine's disguise.

554
00:45:37,630 --> 00:45:39,380
Miss, you cannot!

555
00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:44,920
Today I shall play a Concubine.

556
00:45:44,930 --> 00:45:46,520
Miss...

557
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:54,330
<i>This place is amazing!
Truly genius!</i>

558
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:57,640
Are you not impressed!
Come, next! Next!

559
00:45:57,650 --> 00:45:59,500
Come in, please!

560
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:02,040
This way, this way!

561
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:04,810
Good!!

562
00:46:05,950 --> 00:46:11,580
<i>We have love, wealth,
honor, caution readings!</i>

563
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:17,520
Chun-Jung Choi has not been seen
at the Choi's residence.

564
00:46:17,530 --> 00:46:20,830
We have searched Ganghwa carefully
but he has not been seen.

565
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:25,330
So? You have failed?

566
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,730
Why don't we service
a shaman or fortune teller?

567
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:31,440
Fortune teller?

568
00:46:31,510 --> 00:46:35,110
There have been many famous
fortune tellers lately.

569
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:37,510
Baeohgae has a new Master Choi.

570
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:38,810
Alright.

571
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:44,150
If I seek amusement
I will find one.

572
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:50,660
Go find Chun-Jung Choi!
Do you understand!

573
00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:52,220
Yes, sir!

574
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:05,600
What brings such a noble
elder down here...

575
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,310
You honor me, my Lord.

576
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:12,910
I have heard so much about you,

577
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:16,010
I could not resist.

578
00:47:17,030 --> 00:47:21,620
I waited such a long time
to see you.

579
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:37,140
What do you see?
Do I become rich?

580
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:40,410
Do I have peaceful days
before I die?

581
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:44,440
<i>His face is definitely of a tiger,</i>

582
00:47:44,590 --> 00:47:47,410
<i>but why is his future so bleak?</i>

583
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:50,920
Just like when we met,

584
00:47:50,930 --> 00:47:55,620
you have a rude habit of
staring at my face.

585
00:47:56,130 --> 00:48:00,930
Are you infatuated with my face?

586
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:04,460
Yes, sir,
you have a wonderful face.

587
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:10,030
As I have said previously,
you have the face of a tiger.

588
00:48:10,650 --> 00:48:14,210
But your future is merely of
a pleasure seeking nobody.

589
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:18,510
A nobody?

590
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:23,250
Are you mocking me?

591
00:48:23,490 --> 00:48:26,380
No, I just find it odd.

592
00:48:26,730 --> 00:48:29,720
Your future has anger towards
the higher ups, and no fear.

593
00:48:29,730 --> 00:48:31,420
You are not afraid to
speak your mind.

594
00:48:32,130 --> 00:48:34,290
In the past couple days,
I am sure you spoke too much

595
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:36,630
and got yourself into trouble.

596
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:40,430
Your future is spent writing
apology letters to the nobles.

597
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:44,640
Are you telling
my future or mocking me!

598
00:48:44,910 --> 00:48:45,940
You bastard!

599
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:48,510
There is nothing to be
angry about,

600
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:50,740
because I am not telling
your future.

601
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:56,850
I thought other wise, but now I know.

602
00:49:04,330 --> 00:49:08,330
Are you playing me?

603
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:10,230
What are you doing here?

604
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:13,530
Why do you come meet a fortune teller
and give false information?

605
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:15,130
What do you have to gain?

606
00:49:19,610 --> 00:49:25,110
Maybe, this could be the beginning
of a trusting relationship.

607
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:26,890
<i>Bunguyusin
Faith should reign over
the relation between friendship</i>

608
00:49:26,890 --> 00:49:28,220
Or maybe not...

609
00:49:32,430 --> 00:49:35,620
Why don't I act like you this time?

610
00:49:35,630 --> 00:49:39,620
Let me tell you your fortune!

611
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:43,660
Someone will come looking for you.

612
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:48,370
He will prepare
a feast just for you.

613
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:50,170
However!

614
00:49:51,150 --> 00:49:57,780
During the feast
you must choose your words wisely.

615
00:50:10,530 --> 00:50:12,520
Very masterful.

616
00:50:12,530 --> 00:50:16,430
He is very accurate!

617
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:21,630
Come in.

618
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:32,010
That man is Heungseon-gun, the King's relative right?

619
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:33,380
Move aside,
I must throw some salt.

620
00:50:33,390 --> 00:50:34,610
Why?

621
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:36,620
Because I've heard things.

622
00:50:36,630 --> 00:50:39,520
Two fortune tellers
have told his future.

623
00:50:39,530 --> 00:50:41,320
One died right after the reading,

624
00:50:41,330 --> 00:50:44,620
and the other disappeared,
yet to be found.

625
00:50:46,530 --> 00:50:48,430
Heungseon-gun, that man...

626
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:51,930
He's been living recklessly
for some time now.

627
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:54,130
Ever since Ganghwa Island,

628
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:56,640
5 years ago,
he came back broken.

629
00:50:56,650 --> 00:50:58,600
He brings bad energy!

630
00:50:59,210 --> 00:51:01,510
Come, hurry! Next! Next!

631
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:04,740
Come in, come in.

632
00:51:25,110 --> 00:51:26,630
Are you alright?

633
00:51:28,410 --> 00:51:29,730
Mother...

634
00:51:30,850 --> 00:51:31,800
Mother...

635
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:35,610
Try standing up.

636
00:51:47,930 --> 00:51:49,250
Who are you?

637
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:51,890
I am Ban-Dal's daughter Bong-Ryun.

638
00:51:52,130 --> 00:51:54,930
Your mother has fallen sick, I am here
to perform a healing ritual.

639
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:01,730
My sickness will plague you too.

640
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:04,800
I do not fall to sickness.

641
00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:08,410
you will be fine as well.

642
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:11,110
I know it because I can see.

643
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:18,520
Take care, Young Lord.

644
00:52:55,030 --> 00:52:56,550
What brings you here.

645
00:52:57,430 --> 00:53:00,330
I am here to give you
a small gift, Princess

646
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:04,730
You like birds right?

647
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:07,830
I chose this one myself.

648
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:10,940
Take it back.

649
00:53:11,610 --> 00:53:14,040
I hate animals caged up.

650
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:19,210
You are not allowed to
enter here freely.

651
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:23,510
If you come in again without permission,
you will be punished.

652
00:53:25,330 --> 00:53:27,220
Why do you smell of
such perfume?

653
00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:31,020
Have you used a Concubine's perfume
to seduce men?

654
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:39,560
Even if this world collapses,
and you are the only man alive,

655
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:42,430
please do not worry,

656
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:49,410
I will never seduce you.

657
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:57,420
I am the only person who knows
your past and is willing to accept you

658
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:03,720
