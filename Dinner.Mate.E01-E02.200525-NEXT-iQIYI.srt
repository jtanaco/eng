on this camera.

Hurry and get in here!

499
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:21,635
Okay, I'll get up.

500
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:23,865
Quit your slapstick comedy acts

501

- and make sure you end things right.
- Okay.

502

You, shut it.

503

Don't hit me.

Aren't you going to continue
with the recording?

I mean,

you shouldn't scar
a flight attendant's face.

514

Are you saying it's not okay
to scar her face,

515
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:15,915
but it's okay to scar my pride?

516
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,319
No, that's...

I hate this situation as much as you do.

Why don't you leave after venting
by yanking my hair out,

Yes.

537
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:54,399
Well, it's not a very flashy reason.

538
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,665
At least let me hear it.

539
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:04,005
I don't know when it began,

540
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:07,805
but I started to hate picking up
your calls 80 percent of the time.

541
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:09,679
I started to think of excuses

542
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,975
instead of finding where to go
when you wanted to go on a trip.

543
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:13,589
I stopped saving your photos

544
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:15,285
whenever you sent them to me.

545
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:23,355
When I listened to love songs,

546
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,925
I started to only think
of the singer who sang it.

547
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:29,039
Why that crude punk.

548
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,539
What a brazen rascal.

551
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:38,749
- Right. He's so brazen.
- What a piece of garbage.

552
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:42,005
Sorry, but can everyone please quiet down?

553
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,985
What a detailed reasoning.

554
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:52,655
- Is that it?
- No.

555
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:56,795
This is the main reason.

556
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,035
I started to hate eating with you.

557
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,939
- Gosh.
- What is she going to do?

- Poor her.

- What is up with him?
- Exactly. Oh, no.

560
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:24,419
You should be willing to eat
with someone you love, right?

561
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:25,485
But

562
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:29,995
with you, it became a duty.

563
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:32,725
I didn't eat because I wanted to,

564
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:34,795
but because I had to.

565

If you were going to end things like this,

566
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:47,245
why did you send me a ring photo?

567
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:52,845
That was...

568
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:55,559
Hey, what should I do?

569
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,359
- What should I do?
- Why?

00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,555
What's wrong, sir?

571
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:00,989
I accidentally sent the ring photo
to Do-hee.

572
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:03,359
- Gosh.
- You should always double-check

573
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,999
the photos when you're two-timing.

574
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,329
I checked the photos,

575

but I accidentally sent it to her.

576
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:11,265
- How should I...
- Goodness.

577
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:13,265
What should I do?

578
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,235
Just tell her that your friend is using it
for his proposal.

579
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,509
Tell her you just wanted
to ask an opinion about it.

580
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:20,905
- Good one.
- Oh, right.

581
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:22,375
That photo?

582
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:25,015
I sent it by accident.

583
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:27,185
I'm really sorry.

584
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:29,685
I will accept any punishment.

585
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,555
My mom told me

586
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:39,365
I should just cut your thing off
if you ever cheat on me.

587
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,235
Just like how we cut
the tip of pickled radish.

588
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,439
That's a bit...

589
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:50,579
The tip of pickled radish
can be ground and put in dumplings

590
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:52,375
and seasonings though. But yours

591
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,945
is useless.

592
00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:00,385
Just take good care of it.

593
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:02,755
- Goodness.
- No way.

594
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,425
- Thank you, Do-hee.
- It's been awful,

595
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:10,455

596
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:13,565
You scumbag.

597
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:20,765
I will take the champagne.

598
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:24,535
I have a happy occasion to celebrate.
since I got rid of trash like you.

599
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:27,875
You have it.

00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:32,855
- Please help her.
- Doctor.

650
00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:36,825
He's going to help her!

651
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:43,395
Good luck!

652
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:50,105
You're awesome, Doctor!

653
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:56,115
- Taxi!
- You got this!

654
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:01,449
Please follow the white car in the front.

655
00:44:01,450 --> 00:44:03,255
- Over there.
- Okay.

656
00:44:03,490 --> 00:44:04,755
Okay, bye!

657
00:44:48,170 --> 00:44:50,365
What a dynamic day.

658
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,265
Maybe I should buy a lottery.

659
00:44:52,270 --> 00:44:54,005
I'm sure I can win the first prize.

660
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:08,219
What is it that you did so wrong?

661
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:09,515
Tell me about it.

662
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:12,515
Excuse me? I'm not the one...

663
00:45:13,090 --> 00:45:16,829
I have been driving a cab
in Jeju Island for 27 years now.

664
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:18,629
I have seen over 70,000 men and women

665
00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:22,065
who drove home with rental cars
after having fights.

666
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:26,069
- That's not it.
- I understand.

667
00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:28,865
So what did you do?

668
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:31,775
Did you have different opinions
on the itinerary?

669
00:45:32,010 --> 00:45:34,379
Or did she make you tell her
about your memories here

670
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:36,575
with your ex-girlfriend
with leading questions?

671
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:39,849
I got it.

672
00:45:39,850 --> 00:45:42,519
"Don't you know why I'm angry?"

673
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:45,089
- Is this what happened?
- Can you just focus on following her?

674
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:46,285
That's not it.

675
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:51,155
Sure, sure. I got it.

676
00:46:14,490 --> 00:46:16,415
Could you please stop the car here?

677
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:19,329
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

678
00:46:19,330 --> 00:46:21,689
This place is
a popular photo spot these days.

679
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:23,259
Make up with her and deep kiss her.

680
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:24,429
- Okay.
- You can do it!

681
00:46:24,430 --> 00:46:26,299
- Okay, okay.
- Good.

682
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:27,625
Thank you!

683
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:35,105
Gosh, he's cute.
I wonder if the girl is pretty too.

684
00:47:09,270 --> 00:47:12,945
Darn it. I came here to
get some fresh air.

685
00:47:14,510 --> 00:47:16,545
But only the salty air is
coming through my nose.

686
00:47:19,790 --> 00:47:22,145
My goodness. What's happening?

687
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:29,825
What on earth is she doing?

688
00:47:34,030 --> 00:47:35,595
I might actually end up falling.

689
00:47:36,170 --> 00:47:37,235
Excuse me!

690
00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:40,665
Hey!

691
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:44,035
What are you doing?

692
00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:13,405
What's his problem?

693
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:17,135
Oh, no!

694
00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:18,405
Goodness.

695
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:22,975
Hey.

696
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:25,245
Wake up!

697
00:48:27,350 --> 00:48:29,685
Wait. What?

698
00:48:34,430 --> 00:48:35,625
Are you okay?

699
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:39,125
Who are you?
Why did you suddenly run to me?

700
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:41,465
I didn't know you would dodge like that.

701
00:48:41,770 --> 00:48:44,169
Of course I dodged.

702
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:45,895
I can't just let some man tackle me.

703
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:48,805
You were trying to kill yourself, right?

704
00:48:49,170 --> 00:48:50,635
Why would I kill myself?

705
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:53,075
Af the cafe earlier,

706
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:55,375
I saw you being humiliated.

707
00:48:55,650 --> 00:48:58,115
You were there?

708
00:48:58,250 --> 00:48:59,345
Yes.

709
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:02,015
Gosh, this is embarrassing.

710
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:09,659
You seem to like
meddling with others' business.

711
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:11,859
What? What kind of attitude is that?

712
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:14,929
I was only trying to help you
with good intentions.

713
00:49:14,930 --> 00:49:17,269
I'm the one who saved
a drowning person's life.

714
00:49:17,270 --> 00:49:18,395
Gosh.

715
00:49:18,570 --> 00:49:21,465
I knew it. I knew she wouldn't die.

716
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,705
Don't you have to go and see a doctor?

717
00:49:29,010 --> 00:49:30,619
You seem to have hurt your head.

718
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:31,915
I'm fine.

719
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:36,015
So just go with your friend
standing next to you.

720
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:38,155
"Friend"?

721
00:49:41,130 --> 00:49:42,485
Who is standing next to me?

722
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:45,525
The person next to you who looks like you.

723
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,365
What do you mean by the person next to me?

724
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:52,565
What on earth?

725
00:49:52,910 --> 00:49:54,335
Are you a psychic?

726
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:55,935
The person next to you

727
00:49:56,510 --> 00:49:59,805
who is dressed like you.
Isn't she your friend?

728
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:08,485
Hey, there's blood
on the back of your head.

729
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:09,985
What?

730
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:25,695
Oh, no! Oh, my gosh!

731
00:50:27,070 --> 00:50:29,609
[ Jeju Haseong Hospital ]

732
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:31,709
External force was applied
to the occipital region,

733
00:50:31,710 --> 00:50:33,545
which led to unconsciousness.

734
00:50:33,610 --> 00:50:36,379
Unconsciousness can be caused
by an interruption in blood circulation,

735
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:38,449
functional impairment of neurons,

736
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:39,719
central nervous system disorders,

737
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:41,515
and damaged reticular formation.

738
00:50:41,590 --> 00:50:44,089
But it's hard to give an exact diagnosis.

739
00:50:44,090 --> 00:50:46,629
How bad is it?

740
00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:48,429
An injury can be followed
by low body temperature,

741
00:50:48,430 --> 00:50:52,159
pale face, tachycardia, and acrotism.

742
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,125
So what's your diagnosis, Doctor?

743
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:58,795
Cerebral concussion.

744
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,735
So what's that cerebral thing?

745
00:51:06,810 --> 00:51:08,005
It's a concussion of the brain.

746
00:51:08,210 --> 00:51:10,675
Cerebral means brain.

747
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:12,545
A concussion of the brain, I see.

748
00:51:12,550 --> 00:51:13,815
A concussion of the brain?

749
00:51:14,290 --> 00:51:18,119
You mean, the injury you get when you hit
your head and get dizzy?

750
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:19,659
Yes. That's it.

751
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:21,955
The test result was all right.
It's only a minor laceration.

752
00:51:22,590 --> 00:51:25,755
The sutured wound was only this big.

753
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:27,099
He will be moved to a general ward,

754
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:29,065
and he can go home as soon as he wakes up.

755
00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:32,265
Why does he make it sound
all so difficult?

756
00:51:39,410 --> 00:51:41,005
[ He didn't get on the airplane? ]

757
00:51:41,350 --> 00:51:43,915
Did he take a boat then?
Oh, it was an airport. I'm sorry.

758
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:45,275
Okay.

759
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:47,349
What's going on?
He wouldn't answer my phone

760
00:51:47,350 --> 00:51:48,545
nor has he taken the flight.

761
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:50,515
What time is it again?

762
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:54,885
Oh, it's 7:57 p.m.

763
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:06,665
If only I didn't meddle
with others' business,

764
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:08,439
I'd have already landed at Gimpo Airport,

765
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:12,075
be driving
on the south of Dongjak Bridge by now.

766
00:52:12,210 --> 00:52:15,005
So you live near Gangnam.

767
00:52:15,310 --> 00:52:16,449
Right?

768
00:52:16,450 --> 00:52:18,649
I should cancel all my evening schedules.

769
00:52:18,650 --> 00:52:19,815
Darn it.

770
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:21,315
What?

771
00:52:24,460 --> 00:52:26,259
Maybe I should wash my hair.

772
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:28,829
The nurse said
you shouldn't wash your hair

773
00:52:28,830 --> 00:52:30,825
and keep the wound from water.

774
00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:36,025
Push this part and...

775
00:52:38,970 --> 00:52:41,069
- Where are my clothes?
- They're here.

776
00:52:41,070 --> 00:52:42,735
In there.

777
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:56,919
You should've taken them out to dry...

778
00:52:56,920 --> 00:53:00,255
As a token of my apology,

779
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:01,925
I got you some clothes to wear.

780
00:53:02,190 --> 00:53:03,325
Here.

781
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:06,155
Here you go.

782
00:53:26,590 --> 00:53:29,885
Okay. I'll take that ticket.

783
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:32,885
Thank you. Okay.

784
00:53:38,230 --> 00:53:41,025
I'm glad you can still buy a ticket.

785
00:53:45,270 --> 00:53:47,605
Are you enjoying this?
You're enjoying this now, aren't you?

786
00:53:47,810 --> 00:53:49,105
You think this is funny?

787
00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:50,435
- Well...
- Answer me.

788
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:54,579
Were these extremely vintage clothes
really all you could find?

789
00:53:54,580 --> 00:53:55,775
I'm sorry.

790
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:58,445
There was only one clothing store
in front of the hospital.

791
00:53:58,720 --> 00:53:59,989
Goodness.

792
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:02,515
How am I supposed to
go to the airport like this?

793
00:54:02,850 --> 00:54:04,489
I don't have time to buy new clothes.

794
00:54:04,490 --> 00:54:06,755
Are you sure
you didn't mean to mess with me?

795
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:07,929
No way.

796
00:54:07,930 --> 00:54:09,685
This is unbelievable.

797
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:12,695
Hey.

798
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:15,425
I just really need to tell you this.

799
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,195
You look like Kim Soo-mi

800
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:21,065
on "Granny's Got Talent".

801
00:54:26,010 --> 00:54:28,009
Are you laughing now?

802
00:54:28,010 --> 00:54:30,379
Are you laughing
after making me look like this?

803
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:32,649
Fine. Laugh. Keep laughing.

804
00:54:32,650 --> 00:54:34,715
They say laughing will bring you luck.

805
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:36,085
Keep laughing.

806
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:42,359
I'll get going. Let's end
our weird relationship here.

807
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:44,029
Let me drive you to the airport.

808
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:46,355
I'm good. I'll take a taxi.

809
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:47,399
No.

810
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:49,625
What now? What will you do now?

811
00:54:50,770 --> 00:54:51,895
What is it?

812
00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:53,535
- What is it?
