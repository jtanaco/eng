Hey. Goodness.

Can't you see that I'm breathing?

14
00:01:13,376 --> 00:01:15,516
I hate doing product placements,

15
00:01:16,016 --> 00:01:18,286
but I will consider doing it.

- Thank you. - I'll just consider it.

17
00:01:21,357 --> 00:01:22,357
I'll just think about it.

18

And let's make one thing clear.

19
00:01:26,057 --> 00:01:28,227
Even if I end up doing it,

20
00:01:28,227 --> 00:01:31,826
it's only because of Mr. Ga Yeol Chan.

Have you had breakfast?

28
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:37,267
Yes.

29
00:02:39,126 --> 00:02:41,166
Great job. You should eat breakfast.

30
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:54,617
- Hello. - Hello.

Mr. Oh, come over here. You have to see this.

- What is it? - This is no joke.

00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:03,587
What is it?

36
00:03:05,527 --> 00:03:08,397
- It's out? - Yes, keep going. Keep it going.

Did you eat a rat alive?

39
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:18,406
No, I had chicken.

41
00:03:21,237 --> 00:03:22,577

Do you hear the sound of our sales spiking up?

48
00:03:41,756 --> 00:03:43,356

We're going to sell this abroad too?

51
00:03:47,596 --> 00:03:49,696
Ms. Ban, can you stop us already?

52
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:52,006
- We can't seem to stop. - Have you seen a doctor?

It looks wonderful. My gosh.

Will you please stop doing things like these?

56

What are you talking about? I look like this goblin?

57
00:03:58,747 --> 00:04:00,777
- Stop it. - I thought it was you, Mr. Oh.

58
00:04:00,777 --> 00:04:01,777
Is it my profile?

59

and called him to the set.

That's true,

71

72
00:04:31,346 --> 00:04:33,647
Okay, of course.

73
00:04:33,647 --> 00:04:35,676
I'm sure you managed this all right, Mr. Ga.

00:04:38,623 --> 00:04:39,623
Pardon?

76
00:04:39,623 --> 00:04:43,052
You don't seem very focused recently.

77
00:04:44,362 --> 00:04:46,193
- I'm sorry. - It's okay.

78
00:04:46,193 --> 00:04:48,393
She's just saying that to help you stay on top of everything.

79
00:04:48,393 --> 00:04:50,963
Look at what happened this time. You already know that...

80

- My gosh. - Well...

85
00:05:06,842 --> 00:05:09,852
I tried my best to ruin the Eun Hye Soo project, but...

86

Goodness, don't say that.

87
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:13,123
Take a seat for now.

88
00:05:13,123 --> 00:05:14,422
Take a seat. Please sit down.

92

Mr. Ga was just told off by my kkondae just now.

93
00:05:29,773 --> 00:05:32,102
Do you need anything in the office?

94
00:05:32,102 --> 00:05:33,542
Just say it.

95
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:35,573
Goodness.

96
00:05:38,112 --> 00:05:41,112
How does it feel to be high up here? Isn't the air fresher?

97
00:05:42,013 --> 00:05:43,052
You're right.

98
00:05:46,753 --> 00:05:48,753
All right. Man Sic.

99
00:05:49,253 --> 00:05:51,162
Please hang in there a bit more.

100
00:05:51,162 --> 00:05:52,992
This will all end soon.

101
00:05:55,432 --> 00:05:56,463
I hope...

102
00:05:56,792 --> 00:05:58,432
to see you up here.

103
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:01,833
Yes, sir.

104

105
00:06:15,112 --> 00:06:16,153
Mr. Lee.

106
00:06:17,123 --> 00:06:18,722
Please bring four cups of coffee to the meeting room.

107
00:06:22,393 --> 00:06:24,463
Mr. Lee, what's wrong?

108
00:06:25,323 --> 00:06:27,232
Is there a problem with making coffee?

109
00:06:33,563 --> 00:06:35,932
- No. - Thank you.

110
00:06:46,383 --> 00:06:47,782
Mr. Lee, is the coffee...

111
00:06:49,213 --> 00:06:50,253
What?

112
00:06:50,782 --> 00:06:52,653
What is it? What?

113
00:06:52,653 --> 00:06:54,552
What are you doing with the wrapper?

114
00:06:54,552 --> 00:06:56,123
Make new ones.

115
00:06:57,063 --> 00:07:00,792
No one else drinks coffee mix except for you and Mr. Ahn.

116
00:07:00,792 --> 00:07:03,802
Please prepare Americano from now on. Do you understand?

117
00:07:03,802 --> 00:07:06,432
You kids can make your own coffee.

118
00:07:06,963 --> 00:07:08,532
"You kids"?

119
00:07:08,532 --> 00:07:11,903
You should be thanking me for making coffee for you kids,

120
00:07:11,903 --> 00:07:13,373
yet you're complaining about my being dirty.

121
00:07:13,643 --> 00:07:14,842
And how clean are you, exactly?

122
00:07:14,842 --> 00:07:17,383
Mr. Lee, let's make this clear.

123
00:07:17,383 --> 00:07:20,313
You're an intern, not a director.

124
00:07:20,313 --> 00:07:22,352
Do you think I'm like the other interns?

125
00:07:25,253 --> 00:07:27,922
What's wrong?

126
00:07:28,222 --> 00:07:30,422
- He wants me to make coffee. - She wants me to make coffee.

127
00:07:33,222 --> 00:07:36,992
I'll make the coffee. You should attend the meeting.

128
00:07:39,532 --> 00:07:41,972
He's so unbelievable.

129
00:07:44,742 --> 00:07:46,003
My goodness.

130
00:07:46,203 --> 00:07:49,273
Sir, you shouldn't have done that. She's your superior.

131
00:07:49,273 --> 00:07:52,282
Superior, my foot. She's a mere contract worker.

132
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:54,953
I ought to snap her neck.

133
00:07:55,052 --> 00:07:56,083
Sir.

134
00:07:56,513 --> 00:07:58,852
Hey, come here and make some coffee.

135
00:07:58,852 --> 00:08:00,623
- No, I can do it. - No.

136
00:08:00,653 --> 00:08:04,693
Make four cups of Americano and bring them to the meeting room.

137
00:08:04,722 --> 00:08:05,763
What?

138
00:08:14,003 --> 00:08:15,873
- Where's the coffee? - The others are making it.

139
00:08:18,443 --> 00:08:19,643
What are you writing?

140
00:08:21,013 --> 00:08:23,172
"MF"?

141
00:08:29,352 --> 00:08:31,323
"Male, female"?

142
00:08:34,253 --> 00:08:36,393
Spicy Chicken brand or Joon Ramyeon's...

143
00:08:36,393 --> 00:08:37,692
extension products are good.

144
00:08:38,123 --> 00:08:39,523
It could be meat or curry.

145
00:08:39,523 --> 00:08:41,893
They could be HMR collaborations.

(HMR: A type of instant foods)

147

The topic is "something new but familiar".

148
00:08:45,603 --> 00:08:48,172
I'd like you guys to write up a proposal each.

149
00:08:48,172 --> 00:08:49,202
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

150
00:08:49,202 --> 00:08:50,942
And I'd like the interns to help out.

151
00:08:51,273 --> 00:08:52,302
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

152
00:08:56,273 --> 00:08:57,343
Wait.

153
00:08:57,983 --> 00:08:59,843
How about our interns also write up their own?

154
00:09:00,983 --> 00:09:04,383
Mr. Lee was the one who made Ong Ramyeon.

155
00:09:06,782 --> 00:09:07,792
Is that so?

156
00:09:13,192 --> 00:09:16,733
Is this finally my chance to do some real work?

This is good. I think it's all right.

160
00:09:30,513 --> 00:09:32,483
Gosh, it's so neat.

161
00:09:33,243 --> 00:09:36,753
Mr. Oh, my proposal is going to be breathtaking.

162
00:09:36,782 --> 00:09:38,653
You're already breathtaking as is.

163
00:09:46,393 --> 00:09:47,432
Gosh, that's spicy.

164
00:09:54,133 --> 00:09:55,233

00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,983
for our brains to work.

170
00:10:10,983 --> 00:10:13,182
Our brains will reach the highest effectiveness.

171
00:10:18,662 --> 00:10:21,662
Is there anything you have in mind?

172
00:10:22,832 --> 00:10:25,633
We're told to use the products that already exist.

173
00:10:26,532 --> 00:10:28,903
We have dried pollack.

174
00:10:29,633 --> 00:10:33,202
I thought about adding a bunch of it.

175
00:10:33,403 --> 00:10:34,843
Dried pollack ramyeon...

176
00:10:35,542 --> 00:10:36,873
Is that it?

177
00:10:36,873 --> 00:10:37,883
Yes.

178
00:10:41,412 --> 00:10:42,753
That was too simple, wasn't it?

179
00:10:42,753 --> 00:10:45,182
No, it sounds good.

180
00:10:45,582 --> 00:10:48,952
No wonder you came up with Ong Ramyeon. You're brilliant.

181
00:10:51,363 --> 00:10:52,623
Goodness.

182
00:10:55,633 --> 00:10:56,633
Sir.

183
00:10:57,503 --> 00:11:00,263
Have you ever had it before?

184
00:11:00,672 --> 00:11:03,332
No, I haven't.

185
00:11:03,603 --> 00:11:06,672
But I did add ramyeon to some dried pollack soup.

186
00:11:07,003 --> 00:11:10,412
And it was amazing.

187
00:11:10,542 --> 00:11:13,212
Since then, I tell my wife to add ramyeon...

188
00:11:13,212 --> 00:11:15,113
whenever she cooks some dried pollack soup.

189
00:11:15,113 --> 00:11:16,952
My son loves it as well.

190
00:11:16,952 --> 00:11:18,523
It's that good?

191
00:11:18,523 --> 00:11:19,922
Even kids like it.

192
00:11:19,922 --> 00:11:20,952
Gosh.

193
00:11:21,623 --> 00:11:22,692
That's great.

194
00:11:24,422 --> 00:11:25,422
I guess so.

195
00:11:27,462 --> 00:11:30,263
Is this finally my time to shine?

196
00:11:30,593 --> 00:11:33,932
I feel so alive.

197
00:11:34,473 --> 00:11:36,473
I've always been doing menial work.

198
00:11:36,603 --> 00:11:38,973
And now, I'm finally doing some real work.

199
00:11:39,403 --> 00:11:42,712
Yes, I'm still just as competent.

200
00:11:43,042 --> 00:11:45,042
I truly am.

201
00:11:47,712 --> 00:11:48,712
Sir.

202
00:11:49,983 --> 00:11:51,782
Should I write up a proposal with your idea?

203
00:11:52,082 --> 00:11:54,853
Goodness, you don't have to.

204
00:11:54,853 --> 00:11:57,023
No, no. I really like it.

205
00:11:57,363 --> 00:11:59,263
I'd be more than grateful.

206
00:11:59,263 --> 00:12:00,493
All right, then.

207
00:12:04,263 --> 00:12:07,103
How could I get the ingredients?

208
00:12:13,873 --> 00:12:16,442
There was the limited edition Spicy Chicken Noodles.

209
00:12:16,442 --> 00:12:19,542
I believe the downside was that it wasn't spicy enough.

210
00:12:19,542 --> 00:12:22,282
We need to be unique.

211
00:12:22,552 --> 00:12:25,282
Koreans are known to enjoy very spicy foods.

212
00:12:25,353 --> 00:12:27,922
Isn't our brand known for producing such products?

213
00:12:34,292 --> 00:12:35,292
(Something New but Familiar, Spicy Chicken Ramyeon with Eggs)

214
00:12:35,292 --> 00:12:38,062
Mr. Joo. "Spicy Chicken Ramyeon with Eggs"?

215
00:12:38,062 --> 00:12:39,162
Yes.

216
00:12:39,162 --> 00:12:41,302
I thought about selling the original Spicy Chicken Ramyeon...

217
00:12:41,633 --> 00:12:45,743
alongside a half-boiled egg.

218
00:12:47,873 --> 00:12:50,782
To be honest, Spicy Chicken Ramyeon...

219
00:12:50,782 --> 00:12:53,712
is too spicy for people like me.

220
00:12:53,712 --> 00:12:58,253
That's why I thought adding an egg to it would neutralize...

221
00:12:58,753 --> 00:12:59,922
the spiciness.

222
00:12:59,922 --> 00:13:01,653
The expiration date...

223
00:13:05,462 --> 00:13:06,623
I'll think about it.

224
00:13:06,822 --> 00:13:07,863
Okay.

225
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:09,792
Oh, thank you.

226
00:13:13,633 --> 00:13:14,733
Ms. Lee.

227
00:13:15,302 --> 00:13:16,773
The name of the ramyeon is...

228
00:13:16,773 --> 00:13:19,942
"We've Added Saury to the Ramyeon"?

229
00:13:20,473 --> 00:13:25,013
Yes, it's abbreviated to WASR.

230
00:13:25,182 --> 00:13:29,483
Like so, it'd be interesting to make an entire series.

231
00:13:30,653 --> 00:13:33,353
For example, WASR.

232
00:13:33,483 --> 00:13:35,853
"We've Added Saury to the Ramyeon".

233
00:13:35,853 --> 00:13:37,723
"We've Added Pig Fat to the Ramyeon".

234
00:13:37,723 --> 00:13:39,393
"We've Added Kkakdugi to the Ramyeon".

235
00:13:39,393 --> 00:13:41,062
"We've Added Chicken Heads to the Ramyeon".

236
00:13:41,062 --> 00:13:42,393
"We've Added Chicken Feet to the Ramyeon".

237
00:13:42,393 --> 00:13:44,662
"We've Added Loaches to the Ramyeon".

238
00:13:44,662 --> 00:13:46,532
"We've Added Salad to the Ramyeon".

239
00:13:46,532 --> 00:13:49,832
"We've Added Pupae to the Ramyeon".

240
00:13:50,233 --> 00:13:51,302
Something like this.

241
00:13:53,302 --> 00:13:55,473
Gosh, you're so weird.

242
00:13:55,473 --> 00:13:57,542
No, I think it'll be fun.

243
00:13:59,042 --> 00:14:00,613
You're so original.

244
00:14:09,322 --> 00:14:10,322
All right.

245
00:14:10,322 --> 00:14:13,422
(Something New but Familiar, Dried Pollack Ramyeon)

246
00:14:14,633 --> 00:14:16,893
"Dried Pollack Ramyeon".

247
00:14:47,462 --> 00:14:48,633
This is good.

248
00:14:49,332 --> 00:14:50,393
What is this?

249
00:14:50,863 --> 00:14:55,072
I added our dried pollack cube to our ramyeon.

250
00:14:55,072 --> 00:14:58,702
Yes, that's right. It's dried pollack ramyeon.

251
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:02,143
Is the dried pollack cube the only thing you added?

252
00:15:02,273 --> 00:15:03,613
Yes, just that one.

253
00:15:03,613 --> 00:15:05,812
Come on, that's too easy.

254
00:15:06,712 --> 00:15:07,912
Let's go with this.

255
00:15:08,653 --> 00:15:12,182
It'd be fun to use the same dried pollack packaging.

256
00:15:12,853 --> 00:15:13,883
Mr. Oh.

257
00:15:14,753 --> 00:15:15,893
Great job.

258
00:15:16,192 --> 00:15:17,422
I love you.

259
00:15:22,162 --> 00:15:24,363
Mr. Lee, where's your proposal?

260
00:15:24,363 --> 00:15:25,403
Sorry?

261
00:15:26,003 --> 00:15:28,603
This dried pollack ramyeon was my idea.

262
00:15:32,702 --> 00:15:34,273
What are you talking about?

263
00:15:34,273 --> 00:15:36,672
Oh, my. What are you going on about?

264
00:15:36,672 --> 00:15:37,712
Have you been dreaming?

265
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:40,682
I'm serious. You know that it was my idea.

266
00:15:40,682 --> 00:15:42,883
What are you talking about?

267
00:15:42,883 --> 00:15:44,282
Are you seriously doing this to me?

268
00:15:44,282 --> 00:15:46,052
What have I done to you?

269
00:15:46,052 --> 00:15:48,192
Come on, you're driving me crazy.

270
00:15:48,192 --> 00:15:50,292
You're the one who's driving me crazy.

271
00:15:50,292 --> 00:15:52,123
Why are you doing this to me?

272
00:15:52,462 --> 00:15:55,962
Right. Witnesses. We have witnesses here.

273
00:15:56,192 --> 00:15:58,263
Yoon Soo. Tae Lee. Didn't you see me...

274
00:15:58,532 --> 00:16:02,133
explaining my idea to Mr. Oh? You saw that, right?

275
00:16:02,572 --> 00:16:04,032
- I did? - Yes.

276
00:16:04,572 --> 00:16:07,143
Well, you don't really count even if you were there.

277
00:16:07,143 --> 00:16:09,312
Yoon Soo. Why don't you tell him?

278
00:16:12,682 --> 00:16:16,052
Yes. Can you tell us what you saw?

279
00:16:28,292 --> 00:16:29,292
He never...

280
00:16:30,393 --> 00:16:31,462
did that.

281
00:16:32,562 --> 00:16:34,062
Are you kidding me?

282
00:16:34,062 --> 00:16:35,572
Come on.

283
00:16:35,903 --> 00:16:38,373
Mr. Ga, it's so hard to work here.

284
00:16:52,822 --> 00:16:56,192
So Mr. Lee won't be joining us because he's upset?

285
00:16:56,192 --> 00:16:57,322
No, he won't.

286
00:16:57,393 --> 00:16:59,723
He said he might upset his stomach because what happened wasn't fair.

287
00:17:00,922 --> 00:17:03,832
It doesn't make any sense that he's the one who came up with the idea.

288
00:17:04,363 --> 00:17:06,333
Gosh, that was such an absurd accusation.

289
00:17:06,563 --> 00:17:08,373
I can't say anything to him because he's older than me.

290
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:18,682
Did you eat?

291
00:17:29,692 --> 00:17:31,162
Whatever. As if I care.

292
00:17:37,903 --> 00:17:40,202
I was the one who came up with that idea for the ramyeon!

293
00:17:43,732 --> 00:17:45,972
Mr. Lee, you're in the office, right?

294
00:17:45,972 --> 00:17:46,972
Yes.

295
00:17:47,073 --> 00:17:48,672
I'm going to send you an email.

296
00:17:48,672 --> 00:17:50,043
Make 10 copies of the email...

297
00:17:50,043 --> 00:17:52,043
and bring them to the conference room. Make it quick.

298
00:17:53,313 --> 00:17:55,113
- Okay. - What's your email address?

299

It's mansigi at ongol.co.kr.

Gosh.

302

Just...

303
00:18:09,133 --> 00:18:10,992
go to my desk. The email is already open.

304
00:18:10,992 --> 00:18:12,232
Check it and print it out.

305

00:19:53,962 --> 00:19:54,972
What?

335
00:19:55,502 --> 00:19:56,873
Ransomware?

336
00:19:58,172 --> 00:19:59,172
What's that?

337
00:20:01,543 --> 00:20:02,843
Whose computer?

338
00:20:03,772 --> 00:20:05,083
Ga Yeol Chan?

339
00:20:05,682 --> 00:20:07,442
Wait, what's going on?

340
00:20:08,682 --> 00:20:13,022
The virus spread from Mr. Ga Yeol Chan's computer.

341
00:20:13,182 --> 00:20:15,393
So all of the computers in the office got infected.

342
00:20:15,823 --> 00:20:17,722
- You! - What are you talking about?

343
00:20:18,823 --> 00:20:19,992
What happened?

344
00:20:23,393 --> 00:20:24,603
That jerk, Lee Man Sic.

345
00:20:24,603 --> 00:20:26,603
We checked the virus with the malicious code tool.

346
00:20:26,603 --> 00:20:30,373
I did open another email.

347
00:20:30,373 --> 00:20:33,843
I had no idea that it contained a virus.

348
00:20:34,073 --> 00:20:35,843
You should've only opened up the email I told you to.

349
00:20:36,113 --> 00:20:38,482
Why did you look through my emails?

350
00:20:40,383 --> 00:20:43,482
- What's the damage? - 19 computers were infected.

351
00:20:43,482 --> 00:20:45,752
During lunch, the network for each floor was different.

352
00:20:45,752 --> 00:20:48,393
So the damage wasn't as severe. Otherwise, it would've been awful.

353
00:20:48,752 --> 00:20:49,952
How can you fix this?

354
00:20:49,952 --> 00:20:51,962
We did everything we can do on our end,

355
00:20:51,962 --> 00:20:53,063
but it's not working out.

356
00:20:54,363 --> 00:20:55,633
What's the demand?

357
00:20:55,633 --> 00:20:56,893
3,000 dollars per computer.

358
00:20:56,893 --> 00:21:00,232
19 computers were infected, so that's 57,000 dollars.

359
00:21:00,232 --> 00:21:02,103
In Korean won, it's 70 million won.

360
00:21:02,103 --> 00:21:04,843
They'll double it for each day you're late.

361
00:21:05,303 --> 00:21:06,303
What?

362
00:21:07,002 --> 00:21:08,012
Well,

363
00:21:09,512 --> 00:21:12,613
do I have to pay for the ransom?

364
00:21:12,613 --> 00:21:14,283
Is that what's important now?

365
00:21:18,252 --> 00:21:20,853
I really don't think we should keep him here.

366
00:21:20,853 --> 00:21:24,393
Shouldn't we take a stronger stand on this matter?

367
00:21:24,393 --> 00:21:26,462
He's causing trouble every day.

368
00:21:26,462 --> 00:21:28,992
Exactly. The company isn't some charity.

369
00:21:28,992 --> 00:21:30,732
They want us to be patient until he gets better.

370
00:21:30,732 --> 00:21:32,803
But until when must we wait?

371
00:21:32,803 --> 00:21:34,772
I get that he can make mistakes.

372
00:21:34,772 --> 00:21:36,533
But he said he came up with the idea for the ramyeon.

373
00:21:36,533 --> 00:21:38,143
That's not a mistake.

374
00:21:38,143 --> 00:21:40,403
He's like a thief. Don't you agree?

375
00:21:40,403 --> 00:21:43,343
He told me that "You people make your own coffee."

376
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:44,883
That's my point.

377
00:21:44,883 --> 00:21:46,783
He's getting in the way of everyone.

378
00:21:46,783 --> 00:21:50,353
I really don't think someone like him should work here.

379
00:21:50,353 --> 00:21:52,422
- Exactly. - Right.

380
00:21:52,482 --> 00:21:54,593
It's not an understatement to call him a rotten apple.

381
00:21:54,823 --> 00:21:56,793
There are so many smart people these days.

382
00:21:56,793 --> 00:21:58,022
Exactly.

383
00:21:58,323 --> 00:22:00,293
Why did he come to our team?

384
00:22:00,293 --> 00:22:01,633
Seriously.

385
00:22:41,603 --> 00:22:42,903
Who is that?

386
00:22:43,172 --> 00:22:44,172
Hey.

387
00:22:51,843 --> 00:22:53,343
Aren't you finished your shift?

388
00:22:54,712 --> 00:22:57,952
My gosh. No one is waiting for me at home.

389
00:22:58,383 --> 00:22:59,752
I was planning to go home after the meal.

390
00:23:01,522 --> 00:23:03,692
Isn't it awful to eat your meal in the restroom?

391
00:23:04,522 --> 00:23:06,422
Now that I've been doing that for a while,

392
00:23:06,422 --> 00:23:07,793
I got used to it.

393
00:23:17,502 --> 00:23:19,073
- The person you have reached is... - He's not answering?

394
00:23:19,073 --> 00:23:20,073
No.

395
00:23:20,242 --> 00:23:22,813
- Why don't you call him? - Okay. I'll call him.

396
00:23:41,262 --> 00:23:42,732
If you're that worried, just answer it.

397
00:23:42,732 --> 00:23:43,793
My gosh, hey.

398
00:23:44,063 --> 00:23:45,662
- Hello? - Where are you?

399
00:23:48,972 --> 00:23:50,172
What are you doing?

400
00:23:50,573 --> 00:23:51,942
Do you think working here is a joke?

401
00:23:52,803 --> 00:23:54,912
If you weren't coming back, request for a half day off.

402
00:23:54,912 --> 00:23:56,712
Or you should never come back.

403
00:23:56,712 --> 00:23:58,583
I'll quit.

404
00:23:58,583 --> 00:24:00,783
I'll take responsibility for it and resign.

405
00:24:01,653 --> 00:24:04,053
How can a mere intern take responsibility for it?

406
00:24:04,053 --> 00:24:06,053
I can just submit my resignation.

407
00:24:06,482 --> 00:24:08,452
Don't you know only employees can submit resignation?

408
00:24:11,722 --> 00:24:13,563
Besides, let's get the fact straight.

409
00:24:13,662 --> 00:24:15,262
You're not taking responsibility for it.

410
00:24:15,893 --> 00:24:17,593
You're running away from it.

411
00:24:18,162 --> 00:24:21,103
You ran away too that time.

412
00:24:27,643 --> 00:24:28,912
Suit yourself.

413
00:24:29,972 --> 00:24:32,783
I was quite surprised when I saw you here as an intern.

414
00:24:33,583 --> 00:24:35,883
I questioned myself, "He's going to work under me?"

415
00:24:36,783 --> 00:24:37,783
"At his age?"

416
00:24:40,383 --> 00:24:42,123
So I thought perhaps, you might have changed.

417
00:24:44,353 --> 00:24:45,662
But people don't change.

418
00:24:45,662 --> 00:24:46,722
Yes.

419
00:24:47,323 --> 00:24:49,093
It's not that easy for people to change.

420
00:24:49,563 --> 00:24:54,702
So you must think you have some kind of important position here.

421
00:24:55,573 --> 00:24:58,803
But in my eyes, you're just like that loser from a long time ago.

422
00:24:59,202 --> 00:25:00,202
Loser?

423
00:25:00,472 --> 00:25:01,873
Are you calling me a loser because you're quitting?

424
00:25:01,873 --> 00:25:04,712
I didn't even get started, you punk.

425
00:25:04,883 --> 00:25:08,252
Who are you to order me around? You're such a loser.

426
00:25:08,712 --> 00:25:11,182
You must think you're some big shot now that you have a title.

427
00:25:11,982 --> 00:25:14,922
You people aren't even close to Ongol.

428
00:25:14,922 --> 00:25:16,353
How dare you brag in front of me?

429
00:25:16,353 --> 00:25:18,662
If you like Ongol that much, go join them.

430
00:25:18,662 --> 00:25:20,563
I'm on my way, you punk.

431
00:25:20,563 --> 00:25:23,192
You're all talk. Just leave already.

432
00:25:23,492 --> 00:25:24,662
Right now!

433
00:25:28,573 --> 00:25:29,803
What a wimp.

434
00:25:29,803 --> 00:25:30,903
You called me a wimp again!

435
00:25:51,593 --> 00:25:53,762

439
00:26:09,412 --> 00:26:11,613
Of course. Yes.

440
00:26:19,623 --> 00:26:21,722
I remember opening up something.

441
00:26:31,603 --> 00:26:33,432
Why won't he pick up?

442
00:26:34,363 --> 00:26:35,932
I told him to print it out ages ago.

443
00:26:38,643 --> 00:26:39,942

Yes, Director. I'll be there right now.

448
00:27:02,762 --> 00:27:05,232
It was fine until I opened it up.

449
00:27:06,502 --> 00:27:07,962
Then could I have caused this?

450
00:27:31,192 --> 00:27:33,262
Why haven't I thought of this until now?

451
00:27:34,363 --> 00:27:36,133
You should've only opened up the email I told you to.

452
00:27:36,492 --> 00:27:38,702
Why did you look through my emails?

453
00:27:39,162 --> 00:27:41,333
Did I unconsciously want to conclude...

454
00:27:42,232 --> 00:27:44,073
that it was his fault?

455
00:27:48,343 --> 00:27:50,742

00:30:15,752 --> 00:30:16,992
- Come on. - I'm not doing it.

498
00:30:17,492 --> 00:30:18,863
Take a seat, will you?

499
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:23,192
Man Sic, please let me pour you a drink for this.

500
00:30:25,702 --> 00:30:27,762
For the next vice president.

501
00:30:30,833 --> 00:30:31,843
The vice...

502
00:30:32,442 --> 00:30:33,672
president?

503
00:30:36,643 --> 00:30:37,813
Here.

504
00:30:51,602 --> 00:30:53,373
(Episode 8)

505
00:30:53,559 --> 00:30:56,659
- Did they tell you anything? - So what happened is...

506
00:30:56,659 --> 00:30:58,829
Mr. Ga is here. Get back to your seats.

507
00:30:58,829 --> 00:31:00,098
- Hello. - Hello.

508
00:31:00,098 --> 00:31:01,569
Good morning.

509
00:31:01,999 --> 00:31:03,269
Good morning.

510
00:31:05,577 --> 00:31:08,478
- Let's get back to work. - Yes, sir.

511
00:31:09,018 --> 00:31:10,748
- Okay. - Thank you.

512
00:31:15,518 --> 00:31:16,618
One second, everyone.

513
00:31:20,463 --> 00:31:21,564
I'd like to tell you...

514
00:31:22,603 --> 00:31:25,134
that as of today, Mr. Lee Man Sic...

515
00:31:25,134 --> 00:31:26,134
Yes?

516
00:31:32,774 --> 00:31:35,514
Mr. Ga, good morning.

517
00:31:35,814 --> 00:31:38,083
I'm sorry for stepping over the line yesterday.

518
00:31:38,744 --> 00:31:41,853
Is he really trying to say he'll crawl back to work...

519
00:31:42,253 --> 00:31:44,884
after he told me off yesterday?

520
00:31:59,174 --> 00:32:01,833
Mr. Ga, I'm so sorry.

521
00:32:02,404 --> 00:32:05,503
I must have gone insane yesterday.

522
00:32:05,913 --> 00:32:08,674
I'll put my head down to express my regret to you.

523
00:32:09,783 --> 00:32:11,883
- Goodness, sir. - Old man, stop.

524
00:32:12,883 --> 00:32:14,913
No, don't stop me. A guy like me...

525
00:32:16,253 --> 00:32:18,023
- Whoa, stop this. - The corner! The corner!

526
00:32:19,594 --> 00:32:21,954
- Old man, stop this. - Don't do this.

527
00:32:21,954 --> 00:32:23,124
Please calm down.

528
00:32:23,124 --> 00:32:25,264
- Calm down. - Goodness.

529
00:32:30,434 --> 00:32:31,434
It's okay.

530
00:32:32,874 --> 00:32:34,633
I'll buy coffee for everyone.

531
00:32:35,133 --> 00:32:38,303
- Yoon Soo? - I'll go with IA.

532
00:32:38,303 --> 00:32:40,243
- IA for me too. - I'll go with HA.

533
00:32:40,243 --> 00:32:42,383
- IA with an extra shot. - Latte, please.

534
00:32:43,014 --> 00:32:44,583
Mr. Ga, you take...

535
00:32:45,143 --> 00:32:47,854
espresso doppio in lungo,

536
00:32:47,854 --> 00:32:49,723
very dry cappuccino with whipped cream,

537
00:32:49,723 --> 00:32:52,023
topped with chocolate drizzle and cinnamon powder.

538
00:32:52,023 --> 00:32:53,154
You want that, don't you?

539
00:32:53,154 --> 00:32:55,794
- Wow. - My goodness.

540
00:32:57,463 --> 00:33:00,664
No, I want something else other than coffee today.

541
00:33:02,164 --> 00:33:04,833
Could you head over to that new milk tea place out front...

542
00:33:04,963 --> 00:33:07,234
and get me a cup of black sugar milk tea?

543
00:33:07,873 --> 00:33:09,743
Oh, okay.

544
00:33:10,303 --> 00:33:13,414
The tapioca pearls are in frogspawn or salamander egg sizes.

545
00:33:13,414 --> 00:33:15,544
I want a 6 to 4 ratio of frogspawn and salamander eggs.

546
00:33:15,544 --> 00:33:18,514
No, never mind. A 5 to 5 ratio.

547
00:33:18,514 --> 00:33:20,113
And add premium cream.

548
00:33:20,113 --> 00:33:24,484
Bring it when the leopard gradation gets darker as it goes down.

549
00:33:25,254 --> 00:33:26,324
I'll take it like that.

550
00:33:26,653 --> 00:33:27,794
- Goodness. - Oh, and...

551
00:33:28,023 --> 00:33:31,623
shake it for about 15 seconds.

552
00:33:32,493 --> 00:33:34,933
Shake it for 15 seconds. Remember that.

553
00:33:36,134 --> 00:33:38,363
I can't believe this jerk.

554
00:33:39,704 --> 00:33:41,134
In 5 to 5 ratio.

555
00:33:41,134 --> 00:33:42,574
And add premium cream.

556
00:33:42,574 --> 00:33:46,574
Bring it when the leopard gradation gets darker as it goes down.

557
00:33:46,574 --> 00:33:48,643
I'll take it like that.

558
00:33:48,643 --> 00:33:52,583
Oh, and shake it for about 15 seconds.

559
00:33:54,183 --> 00:33:56,523
I'll take four of these...

560
00:33:56,523 --> 00:33:58,153
and three IA.

561
00:33:59,053 --> 00:34:01,023
Sure, we'll get that ready for you.

562
00:34:07,164 --> 00:34:08,234
Did you shake it?

563
00:34:22,044 --> 00:34:23,044
Here.

564
00:34:24,643 --> 00:34:26,484
Yes, this is it.

565
00:34:27,713 --> 00:34:29,053
- Thank you. - My pleasure.

566
00:34:31,653 --> 00:34:33,194
- Thank you. - Enjoy.

567
00:34:33,194 --> 00:34:34,924
- I shook it for you. - Thank you.

568
00:34:46,104 --> 00:34:47,204
That's Mr. Oh?

569
00:34:47,204 --> 00:34:49,303
- This was what happened? - No way.

570
00:34:49,303 --> 00:34:51,903
- My gosh. - I can't believe it.

571
00:34:51,903 --> 00:34:54,813
How could he call himself a superior?

572
00:34:56,083 --> 00:34:57,784
How could he do that?

573
00:34:57,944 --> 00:34:59,713
What's wrong?

574
00:35:00,213 --> 00:35:01,213
Well...

575
00:35:01,513 --> 00:35:03,654
I think you should see this.

576
00:35:04,024 --> 00:35:05,053
What is it?

577
00:35:05,053 --> 00:35:07,553
A recording was uploaded on the intranet.

578
00:35:08,493 --> 00:35:09,524
Let me hear it.

579
00:35:11,294 --> 00:35:12,933
Anytime, now.

580
00:35:12,933 --> 00:35:13,993
Okay.

581
00:35:13,993 --> 00:35:16,234
(Anonymous Bulletin Board)

582
00:35:16,234 --> 00:35:18,664
Is there anything you have in mind?

583
00:35:18,664 --> 00:35:21,404
We're told to use the products that already exist.

584
00:35:21,404 --> 00:35:24,104
We have dried pollack.

585
00:35:24,243 --> 00:35:28,144
I thought about adding a bunch of it.

586
00:35:28,644 --> 00:35:31,714
Dried pollack ramyeon... Is that it?

587
00:35:32,284 --> 00:35:33,284
- Yes. - My gosh.

588
00:35:33,284 --> 00:35:34,484
Come on.

589
00:35:35,084 --> 00:35:37,123
The audio is of poor quality.

590
00:35:37,123 --> 00:35:38,854
Someone must've fabricated this.

591
00:35:38,854 --> 00:35:40,294
As if.

592
00:35:40,623 --> 00:35:42,123
Don't be ridiculous.

593
00:35:43,863 --> 00:35:45,863
This is neither the NFS nor the NIS.

594
00:35:46,063 --> 00:35:48,063
Who'd fabricate that?

595
00:35:49,503 --> 00:35:53,104
If you have a conscience, you should admit to your mistakes.

596
00:35:54,433 --> 00:35:58,073
You guys aren't any better either! You all lied too.

597
00:35:58,503 --> 00:36:01,214
Do you finally understand how competent I am?

598
00:36:01,914 --> 00:36:02,943
I think...

599
00:36:03,743 --> 00:36:05,584
it is Mr. Oh's proposal.

600
00:36:08,453 --> 00:36:09,484
Sir.

601
00:36:11,224 --> 00:36:13,123
It doesn't matter who came up with the idea.

602
00:36:13,993 --> 00:36:16,224
Spitballing an idea doesn't make it complete.

603
00:36:16,224 --> 00:36:19,024
It's only worthy if you can write up...

604
00:36:19,534 --> 00:36:20,993
a convincing proposal.

605
00:36:21,993 --> 00:36:24,563
Whoever wrote the proposal is the owner.

606
00:36:25,703 --> 00:36:26,803
Do you understand?

607
00:36:32,344 --> 00:36:33,344
If you feel upset about it,

608
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:36,784
you should submit your own.

609
00:36:38,214 --> 00:36:40,383
Being competent also means you can protect your own ideas.

610
00:36:44,284 --> 00:36:45,453
We'll keep that in mind.

611
00:36:52,164 --> 00:36:54,563
I'm pretty sure it's her.

612
00:36:55,464 --> 00:36:56,633
It must be this weirdo.

613
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:01,974
Don't you think Joo Yoon Soo seems a bit fishy at times?

614
00:37:01,974 --> 00:37:03,604
Yes, you're right.

615
00:37:04,243 --> 00:37:06,974
His face screams "betrayer".

616
00:37:07,313 --> 00:37:08,414
He looks like a weasel.

617
00:37:09,243 --> 00:37:12,144
Okay, you search his desk.

618
00:37:12,144 --> 00:37:13,183
Okay.

619
00:37:13,284 --> 00:37:14,484
Quiet down!

620
00:37:35,234 --> 00:37:37,703
It's this! It's this!

621
00:37:39,073 --> 00:37:40,714
You little fox.

625
00:37:49,584 --> 00:37:51,524
- It's her, isn't it? - "We've Added Chicken Heads..."

626
00:37:51,524 --> 00:37:52,524
- "We've Added Chicken Feet..." - "We've Added..."

627
00:37:52,524 --> 00:37:54,424
Maybe she was just recording herself as practice.

628
00:37:54,424 --> 00:37:57,024
Be quiet! She removed it.

629
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:58,193
You have no idea.

630
00:37:58,193 --> 00:38:00,234
- I knew it. - "We've Added Pupae".

(Marketing and Sales Department)

635
00:38:18,914 --> 00:38:20,714
- Ms. Lee. - Yes?

636
00:38:22,013 --> 00:38:23,683
Can you organize these for me by the end of the day?

637
00:38:26,924 --> 00:38:28,193
- Are you asking me? - Yes.

638
00:38:28,193 --> 00:38:30,363
Mr. Joo is a bit busy today. I'm sorry.

639
00:38:31,123 --> 00:38:33,034
Could you also bring me my lunch?

640
00:38:33,034 --> 00:38:34,863
Yes, sir.

641
00:38:35,334 --> 00:38:38,133
I'd like a Dragon King Lunchbox from the Palace of Sea Kings.

642
00:38:38,503 --> 00:38:39,573
Yes, sir.

643
00:38:41,133 --> 00:38:43,104
What are you doing to my mentee?

644
00:38:43,104 --> 00:38:44,104
What?

645
00:38:44,104 --> 00:38:45,443
Ms. Tak...

646
00:38:47,274 --> 00:38:48,644
Please photocopy these.

647
00:38:48,644 --> 00:38:49,943
Yes, ma'am.

648
00:38:49,943 --> 00:38:50,943
Make three copies.

649
00:38:51,943 --> 00:38:52,953
Yes, ma'am.

650
00:38:58,683 --> 00:38:59,794
Thank you.

651
00:39:01,524 --> 00:39:03,993
This card isn't working. Do you have another one?

652
00:39:05,063 --> 00:39:06,493
Please wait a minute.

653
00:39:07,394 --> 00:39:08,664
Yes, what is it?

654
00:39:08,834 --> 00:39:09,933
The card isn't working?

655
00:39:11,063 --> 00:39:13,904
Oh, dear. I gave you the wrong one.

656
00:39:14,133 --> 00:39:16,774
I'm sorry, but I think you'll have to come back.

657
00:39:16,774 --> 00:39:19,774
No, I'm not ready for a promotion.

658

Gosh, I'm so sorry,

663
00:39:37,424 --> 00:39:39,593
but I'm craving sundae soup.

664
00:39:39,764 --> 00:39:41,294
Can you get a refund?

665
00:39:42,634 --> 00:39:43,634
Okay.

666
00:39:47,004 --> 00:39:48,504
Here you go.

667
00:39:50,073 --> 00:39:51,473
- Hello? - Ms. Lee.

668
00:39:51,473 --> 00:39:53,544
Can you get kimchi fried rice instead?

669
00:39:54,874 --> 00:39:58,144
I'm truly sorry. I'm sorry.

670
00:40:02,284 --> 00:40:04,024
Ms. Lee.

671
00:40:04,853 --> 00:40:07,894
Actually, I think I want the Dragon King Lunchbox after all.

672
00:40:07,894 --> 00:40:09,894
Let's go back there. Okay.

673
00:40:13,394 --> 00:40:14,433
Hey.

674
00:40:20,303 --> 00:40:21,404
What's with him?

675
00:40:21,833 --> 00:40:24,803
Ms. Lee was the one who uploaded the recording.

676
00:40:26,144 --> 00:40:27,244
Who said that?

677
00:40:27,544 --> 00:40:28,674
Mr. Oh.

678
00:40:31,244 --> 00:40:32,284
Are you sure?

679
00:40:32,284 --> 00:40:35,213
He found a voice recorder on her desk.

680
00:40:35,953 --> 00:40:39,024
You should treat her better.

681
00:40:39,284 --> 00:40:42,553
After all, she was trying to help you.

682
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:47,193
What?

683
00:40:48,364 --> 00:40:49,703
She was the one...

684
00:40:50,733 --> 00:40:52,004
who uploaded that?

685
00:41:01,213 --> 00:41:05,284
Ms. Lee, I'm sorry. Can you just buy kimchi fried rice?

686
00:41:05,483 --> 00:41:06,483
Okay.

687
00:41:08,384 --> 00:41:10,183
Just eat anything.

688
00:41:15,394 --> 00:41:17,323
Here you go.

689
00:41:17,323 --> 00:41:18,593
- Goodness. - I brought it.

690
00:41:18,593 --> 00:41:20,794
It must've been tiring. Good work.

691
00:41:24,904 --> 00:41:26,103
Darn it!

692
00:41:27,774 --> 00:41:32,004
The egg is hard-boiled.

693
00:41:32,644 --> 00:41:35,744
When having kimchi fried rice,

694
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:39,483
you should be able to mix the yolk with the rice.

695
00:41:39,483 --> 00:41:40,483
Don't you know that?

696
00:41:40,614 --> 00:41:43,424
How am I to mix everything when it's so dry?

697
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:47,154
You know what? You can have this.

698
00:42:01,233 --> 00:42:05,244
I... I was giving it to you.

699
00:42:25,093 --> 00:42:28,634
How about we interns have a get-together?

700
00:42:28,764 --> 00:42:30,634
I should've proposed this earlier...

701
00:42:30,904 --> 00:42:33,134
as the eldest in the group.

702
00:42:34,034 --> 00:42:36,274
How about some beef? It's my treat.

703
00:42:36,544 --> 00:42:37,544
Deal.

704
00:42:43,183 --> 00:42:45,144
I thought we were having beef.

705
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:46,813
Come on.

706
00:42:47,514 --> 00:42:49,624
You know how much we get.

707
00:42:50,384 --> 00:42:51,624
Let's have beef next time.

708
00:42:52,994 --> 00:42:54,823
Here. Have a drink.

709
00:42:55,223 --> 00:42:56,264
Here.

710
00:42:58,924 --> 00:43:02,394
All right. Let's clink our glasses.

711
00:43:08,404 --> 00:43:10,244
Since we got to know each other,

712
00:43:10,244 --> 00:43:13,073
let's have a get-together from time to time.

713
00:43:14,943 --> 00:43:17,843
What is it? Is it no fun to hang out with an old man?

714
00:43:17,843 --> 00:43:19,083
No, sir.

715
00:43:19,083 --> 00:43:20,284
Of course, it isn't.

716
00:43:22,353 --> 00:43:23,553
I'll be honest.

717
00:43:23,553 --> 00:43:26,924
You seem like a company director, not a colleague.

718
00:43:26,924 --> 00:43:28,294
You little...

719
00:43:29,723 --> 00:43:34,294
I know that you guys call me Kkon-tern.

720
00:43:35,164 --> 00:43:39,034
But still, can't you treat me better face-to-face?

721
00:43:41,103 --> 00:43:43,573
Kids these days are so impertinent.

722
00:43:47,514 --> 00:43:49,843
I'm sorry.

723
00:43:49,884 --> 00:43:52,514
It's a force of habit.

724
00:43:54,654 --> 00:43:55,654
I'm sorry...

725
00:43:57,754 --> 00:43:59,323
for scolding you.

726
00:44:04,823 --> 00:44:07,093
It's probably because I was a superior for so long.

727
00:44:07,693 --> 00:44:11,933
It's not easy to fix this habit.

728
00:44:13,433 --> 00:44:14,433
Did you know?

729
00:44:15,573 --> 00:44:17,674
There are two things senior employees...

730
00:44:17,674 --> 00:44:19,914
have to keep in mind the most.

731
00:44:20,144 --> 00:44:22,614
The first one is, don't be nosy.

732
00:44:22,614 --> 00:44:24,343
Our experience isn't valuable.

733
00:44:24,343 --> 00:44:27,254
The second one is, don't talk about your past.

734
00:44:27,254 --> 00:44:30,483
No one is interested in your past.

735
00:44:30,483 --> 00:44:33,093
I know that. I know all of it,

736
00:44:33,093 --> 00:44:34,154
but...

737
00:44:35,093 --> 00:44:38,494
My gosh. I'm getting the urge to talk about that.

738
00:44:43,534 --> 00:44:44,534
Hey.

739
00:44:45,333 --> 00:44:47,534
Thank you.

740
00:44:48,433 --> 00:44:49,603
Thank you.

741
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:53,213
Ma'am, three servings of fried rice, please.

742
00:44:54,014 --> 00:44:55,374
Hey, Tae Lee.

743
00:44:57,614 --> 00:45:00,213
Thank you. Okay?

744
00:45:01,384 --> 00:45:02,654
You were the one...

745
00:45:04,154 --> 00:45:06,924
who salvaged the last bit...

746
00:45:07,453 --> 00:45:10,294
of my remaining pride.

747
00:45:10,764 --> 00:45:11,994
Thank you.

748
00:45:13,494 --> 00:45:14,494
Thank you.

749
00:45:16,563 --> 00:45:17,563
Hey.

750
00:45:18,433 --> 00:45:21,534
But what's up with your hair?

751
00:45:21,534 --> 00:45:24,374
Ma'am, a bottle of Coke, please.

752
00:45:25,443 --> 00:45:28,644
If you cut out this horse-tail resembling hair of yours,

753
00:45:28,644 --> 00:45:29,884
you'll look neat.

754
00:45:29,884 --> 00:45:32,213
Come on. That's enough!

755
00:45:35,553 --> 00:45:37,953
What do you know about fashion?

756
00:45:38,524 --> 00:45:41,553
What do you, old people, know anything about two-tone hair?

757
00:45:43,823 --> 00:45:45,223
I'm sorry.

758
00:46:08,053 --> 00:46:10,823
Look. It's nice and neat.

759
00:46:12,483 --> 00:46:14,193
You!

760
00:46:14,794 --> 00:46:17,424
You scumbag!

761
00:46:22,093 --> 00:46:24,164
Are you going back to the office now?

762
00:46:25,303 --> 00:46:29,103
Yes. I want to fix the proposal I submitted the other day.

763
00:46:33,843 --> 00:46:35,014
What about your hair?

764
00:46:36,374 --> 00:46:37,414
Gosh.

765
00:46:38,244 --> 00:46:40,453
I'll go to a hair salon and see what I can do.

766
00:46:42,813 --> 00:46:46,553
Gosh. He's a much bigger kkondae than I expected.

767
00:46:49,494 --> 00:46:50,723
But why didn't you say...

768
00:46:50,723 --> 00:46:53,333
that you were the one who made the proposal?

769
00:46:54,534 --> 00:46:55,534
You knew?

770
00:46:56,803 --> 00:46:58,733
I can't be on my mentor's bad side.

771
00:46:58,733 --> 00:47:00,904
It will be reflected in my evaluation.

772
00:47:01,134 --> 00:47:02,203
My gosh.

773
00:47:03,274 --> 00:47:05,573
Isn't he so evil?

774
00:47:05,904 --> 00:47:09,374
In the end, he didn't lift a finger to do any of this.

775
00:47:10,144 --> 00:47:11,483
Is that why you exposed him?

776
00:47:11,813 --> 00:47:12,884
Expose whom?

777
00:47:13,414 --> 00:47:15,983
I thought you were the one who uploaded the recording file.

778
00:47:16,654 --> 00:47:17,654
Me?

779
00:47:17,983 --> 00:47:21,723
Yes. That's why Mr. Lee bought us meat to thank you.

780
00:47:22,254 --> 00:47:23,323
What?

781
00:47:25,723 --> 00:47:27,994
Our brains will reach the highest effectiveness.

782
00:47:27,994 --> 00:47:30,634
(1 day before the stealing incident of the proposal)

783
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:34,833
Yes, this is Joonsu Food.

784
00:47:37,174 --> 00:47:40,174
Ms. Lee? What's her first name?

785
00:47:41,544 --> 00:47:43,713
We're told to use the products that already exist.

786
00:47:44,544 --> 00:47:46,014
We have dried pollack.

787
00:47:46,014 --> 00:47:47,014
(Record)

788
00:47:47,784 --> 00:47:48,983
How did you find me here?

789
00:48:12,443 --> 00:48:17,314
(The day of the proposal-stealing incident)

790
00:48:23,584 --> 00:48:25,783
There's a recording.

791
00:48:26,793 --> 00:48:27,793
(Record)

792
00:48:30,094 --> 00:48:32,564
I can recognize your voice, Ms. Lee.

793
00:48:32,693 --> 00:48:34,094
- Did you already forget my voice? - We're told to use...

794
00:48:34,094 --> 00:48:35,493
the products that already exist.

795
00:48:36,164 --> 00:48:38,463
- We have dried pollack. - How did you find me here?

796
00:48:38,463 --> 00:48:39,733
I thought I saw you...

797
00:48:39,733 --> 00:48:42,134
- at Joonsu Food. - I thought about adding...

798
00:48:42,134 --> 00:48:44,804
- So I looked into that. - a bunch of it.

799
00:48:44,804 --> 00:48:47,314
- But you were really there. - Is that it?

800
00:48:47,314 --> 00:48:49,043
Do you know you're stalking me?

801
00:48:49,043 --> 00:48:50,513
That was too simple, wasn't it?

802
00:48:50,884 --> 00:48:53,384
- I'm recording this. - No, it sounds good.

803
00:48:53,384 --> 00:48:55,483
- Come on, I'm not your stalker. - No wonder you came up...

804
00:48:55,483 --> 00:48:58,283
- Can't I call my former employee? - You're brilliant.

805
00:48:58,683 --> 00:49:00,894
- We're pretty special, you know. - Sir.

806
00:49:00,894 --> 00:49:03,223
Have you ever had it before?

807
00:49:03,223 --> 00:49:06,763
No, I haven't.

808
00:49:06,963 --> 00:49:09,664
(Something New but Familiar, Dried Pollack Ramyeon)

809
00:49:12,604 --> 00:49:15,134
"Dried Pollack Ramyeon"?

810
00:49:16,503 --> 00:49:18,773
We have dried pollack.

811
00:49:18,773 --> 00:49:22,914
I thought about adding a bunch of it.

812
00:49:23,283 --> 00:49:25,914
That was too simple, wasn't it?

813
00:49:26,614 --> 00:49:28,814
Mr. Lee, where's your proposal?

814
00:49:28,814 --> 00:49:29,814
Sorry?

815
00:49:30,483 --> 00:49:34,023
This dried pollack ramyeon was my idea.

816
00:49:34,953 --> 00:49:37,624
I submitted that, sir.

817
00:49:37,624 --> 00:49:40,433
What are you guys talking about?

818
00:49:40,594 --> 00:49:42,134
That was my idea.

819
00:49:42,263 --> 00:49:44,104
You know that it was my idea.

820
00:49:44,104 --> 00:49:46,304
What are you talking about?

821
00:49:46,304 --> 00:49:47,973
Are you seriously doing this to me?

822
00:49:48,233 --> 00:49:49,904
What have I done to you?

823
00:49:50,104 --> 00:49:52,473
Come on, you're driving me crazy.

824
00:49:52,473 --> 00:49:53,713
You're the one...

825
00:49:53,713 --> 00:49:54,973
- All right. - who's driving me crazy.

826
00:49:55,314 --> 00:49:57,013
- Even if I kick him out of here, - Right.

827
00:49:57,013 --> 00:49:59,283
- but I'll have a clean conscience. - We have witnesses here.

828

- at Joonsu Food. - I thought about adding...

834
00:50:12,564 --> 00:50:15,664
- Can you mute the call... - Okay.

835
