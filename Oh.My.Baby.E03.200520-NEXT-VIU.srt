1
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,870
- My goodness. - Why do they have to be so cute?

2
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:04,900
My gosh.

3
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,050
I won't get bewitched by you guys.

4
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,300
Why are you talking to yourself?

5
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,890
I thought you did aerobics, but it looks like you're in a circus.

6
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,430
I need to dress in fancy colors to stand out. You know nothing.

7
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:22,650
What are you doing here?

8
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:23,930
Mom.

9
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:26,000
Let's go on a date.

10
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,720
What will you buy for me?

11
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,760
Just hurry up and get changed.

12
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,430
Make sure you get changed, okay?

13
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,420
Is this it?

14
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,080
- Buy me more. - No, stop

15
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:53,490
We bought enough.

16
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:07,040
My goodness, come here.

17
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,070
Ever since I was young, I thought there'd be a secret to my birth.

18
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:39,190
I guess I was right. A real mother wouldn't have done this.

19
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,330
If I wasn't your real mom,

20
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,130
I wouldn't have bought you something so expensive.

21
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:45,410
It looks so fancy and beautiful on you.

22
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,910
It suits you so well.

23
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,380
Whatever. You're just sorry.

24
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,320
Let's say I bought you that because I felt sorry.

25
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:54,820
But what about you? Why did you buy me all these gifts?

26
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,190
Did you get yourself in trouble?

27
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:00,790
Gosh, no. Why would I get myself in trouble?

28
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:03,090
Why don't you ever get yourself in trouble?

29
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:05,660
You're almost 40. You should be more adventurous.

30
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,900
You're too honest and kind.

31
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,660
My goodness.

32
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:14,340
Then I guess I should get myself in big trouble.

33
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,730
You'd better not change your mind.

34
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,340
Promise me.

35
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,150
Why do I need to promise? What's with you?

36
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,410
I made up my mind.

37
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,040
And I hope you cooperate.

38
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:39,100
Hey. You guys.

39
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:43,070
Can you not fight today? I even baked cookies for you guys.

40
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,100
- You know how to bake cookies? - Sit down.

41
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,500
Did you bake it with dirt?

42
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,780
You're such a picky eater unlike how you look.

43
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:59,880
Let's order pig trotters.

44
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,480
Pig trotters, my foot.

45
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,880
It's a special party. Let's order chicken.

46
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,690
I haven't been out in three months.

47
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:07,690
I haven't had fun for six months.

48
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:12,160
I've been craving pig trotters for a few months now.

49
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:16,220
Every day, I tell myself that I'll eat pig trotters tonight.

50
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:17,900
I promise myself that.

51
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,870
But once I clean the house, clean after the kids,

52
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:24,630
cook dinner for my husband, and eat the leftover food,

53
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,540
I suddenly lose my appetite.

54
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,880
That's why I still haven't had pig trotters.

55
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,570
And in three hours,

56
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,250
I'll be back in a world where there are no pig trotters.

57
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,040
- Order pig trotters. - Got it.

58
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,910
Yes, order chicken.

59
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,880
Why do you have to be friends with a guy like him?

60
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,530
We were friends first. You came later.

61
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,690
Darn you. You're so annoying.

62
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,870
What's with her? Is she bipolar?

63
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:55,470
Don't mess with her. She has twin boys.

64
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:56,910
My goodness.

65
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,910
Look at you. Are you an alcoholic?

66
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,120
I think so. He got divorced, you know

67
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:07,520
I can hear you.

68
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:10,220
- Just order pig trotters. - Order chicken.

69
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,550
- Pig trotters! - Chicken!

70
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:12,910
- Trotters. - Fried chicken.

71
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:14,420
- Trotters. - Fried chicken.

72
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,460
I...

73
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,330
Shut it, both of you.

74
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,220
Before I order one of the two,

75
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,400
I have an announcement to make.

76
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,640
First, fill your glasses.

77
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:34,410
This party...

78
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:38,350
is to celebrate the second chapter of my life.

79
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:41,850
I, Jang Ha Ri, have decided not to get married.

80
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:48,760
Guys, why aren't you saying anything?

81
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:54,920
Whether you announce it or not,

82
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:57,700
it's not really up to you.

83
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:01,470
Take me for instance. I grew up never wanting to get married.

84
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,010
All I agreed to was a cup of coffee, but look at where I am now.

85
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:08,080
What's there to announce?

86
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:10,600
There was a slim chance of you getting married anyway.

87
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,240
Is this because of that blind date?

88
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:18,290
No, that didn't go any further because we weren't compatible.

89
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,520
- Unbelievable. - Do you have dementia?

90
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,760
Have you forgotten...

91
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,050
that you were never the dating type?

92
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,490
Don't you remember?

93
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:31,860
Ms. Jang?

94
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,730
- Gosh, what brings you here? - I had business nearby.

95
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,230
Anyway, I've been meaning to call you.

96
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:43,580
But that would've been a mistake since you have a boyfriend.

97
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:46,410
He's just a friend. The son of my mom's friend.

98
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,150
Is that so?

99
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:51,480
Right, then are you free this weekend?

100
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:54,420
I have tickets to a musical if you're up for it.

101
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,890
I'll even buy dinner.

102
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:00,030
A deadline is coming up for me, so maybe you can take someone else.

103
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:06,160
The tickets are until this month. Would you be available?

104
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,340
I don't want to make a promise I can't keep.

105
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,280
By the way, did you see the announcement I sent out?

106
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,100
I'll have Mr. Kim look at it.

107
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,470
He'll now be taking over.

108
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,670
- I'll see you around. - You too.

109
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:24,610
What the...

110
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:29,760
He just asked you out on a date, you moron.

111
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:31,420
When will you ever learn?

112
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:36,920
This is why I never wanted to set you up with anyone.

113
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:42,060
I was clueless back then.

114
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,840
No, your DNA has been wired this way.

115
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,670
You're right.

116
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:49,010
I've never been good at dating...

117
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,170
and marriage is a long-shot for me.

118
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,450
So what?

119
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:54,450
There are more things we can't do compared to the ones we can.

120
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,290
Then why have you been desperate to get married?

121
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:58,520
Gosh.

122
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:00,850
You know what? Good for you.

123
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,920
Marriage only leads to a dishtowel or a rag in your hand.

124
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:06,420
Just like you have been so far,

125
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,620
live your life with a laptop in one hand...

126
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,200
and a take-out coffee in another.

127
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:16,160
Right. Well, thanks for your sincere support.

128
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:23,410
Anyway, there's something else I wanted to tell you.

129
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:27,810
Hold on. But I've received so many monetary gifts from you.

130
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:31,180
You know what? I'll buy you something for this occasion.

131
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,090
Tell me whatever you need.

132
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:35,680
That's not necessary. Save it for yourself.

133
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,460
- It's not even important. - Just take it.

134
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:41,720
This is probably your last chance to receive any celebratory gift.

135
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,420
Zip it...

136
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:45,430
or you'll taste my foot in your mouth.

137
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:50,560
Anyway, I...

138
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:53,670
So did you order the trotters?

139
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:55,100
Fried chicken comes first.

140
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,800
Order the trotters right away.

141
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,610
- No, fried chicken. - Trotters.

142
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:00,810
Fried chicken!

143
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,850
- You two... - No to trotters!

144
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:06,160
- You two! - Fine, I'll order it myself.

145
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,030
- Trotters are what I love. - Unbelievable.

146
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:11,350
- I have no one looking out for me. - You jerk.

You can't receive infertility treatments...

00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,390
unless you're married.

155
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:15,290
The only exceptions are for women in a de facto marriage.

156
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:18,530
You need a spouse's consent to receive sperm from a donor.

157
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:22,660
So what's the best way to get pregnant within six months?

158
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:29,640
You can marry a man and get pregnant with him...

159
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:31,670
or...

160
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:39,310
find some random guy and get knocked up.

161
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:46,120
What happens if I have the baby without his knowledge...

162
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:50,080
and he finds out that I lied about it?

163
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,500
Well...

164
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:56,870
It's like the storyline of my favorite soap opera.

00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,700
Anyway, an unmarried woman can't find a sperm donor in Korea.

166
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:09,070
There aren't many donors for even all the infertile couples.

167
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:12,480
I'm also a patient who was diagnosed as infertile.

168
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,540
The law is against it, so you must find another way.

169
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:17,150
- I must find another way? - That's right.

170
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,050
On your own.

- It's me. - Why haven't you been picking up?

173
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,910
- How was the move? - Fine.

174
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:54,760
It's the anniversary of dad's death next Wednesday.

175
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:57,580
I know.

176
00:11:58,450 --> 00:11:59,530
You'll be there, right?

177
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,420
Sure.

178
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,370
Be there. Mom's hoping to see you.

179
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:24,040
Ms. Jang.

180
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:30,530
Are you still embarrassed to see me?

181
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,460
No, I couldn't be more comfortable around you.

182
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,540
Is that so? Me too.

183
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:52,040
What? What now?

184
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:58,520
Thank you for working with us on the cover.

Let me thank you for the car ride with a meal.

Just tell me what it is you want.

It's not like we're close enough to communicate through gazes.

188
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,430
I got it. I take back what I said about avoiding you.

189
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,830
- Bingo. - Gosh, I'm smart.

190
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,170
Like I said...

191
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,210
Was I tricked just now?

192
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:33,890
Unbelievable.

193
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,060
Sorry, everyone.

194
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:46,000

How exactly do they raise their son?

198
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:58,380
- I'll meet them and ask. - How do you expect to do that?

199
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:00,280
I'll try and schedule an interview.

200
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,250
Go ahead. Who knows?

201
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,790
We might have our first sold-out issue thanks to you.

Yes, boss.

What about that friend who's living off you and your mom?

209

He's a single dad with a decent enough profile.

Or how about this since you're older now?

216

I'm sure you're old enough for this.

How about we get some raw fish?

00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,440
- No, Korean beef barbecue. - What?

227
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,990
They're clueless, aren't they?

228
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:13,550
- Sushi. - We should eat beef.

He isn't my friend.

Isn't it obvious at a glance?

263
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:44,560
Of course. Just look at him. Everything screams "I'm homeless."

264
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:47,300
I guess I am homeless.

265

Do Ah, I bought this earlier.

266
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,950

How many years has it been?

270
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:09,060
I've wondered how you were doing after you left like that.

271
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:12,290
That's what I thought. That's why I came to see you.

272
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:14,330
Since it was a trip nonetheless.

273
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:18,510
I'm glad you were relaxed enough to shop for a gift.

Are you working again?

275
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,450
Yes.

276
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:25,780
You must make the effort to get along with people.

277
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:28,250
Being in large groups gives you confidence.

278
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:32,720
Confidence.

279
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,880
What about corn-fidence?

280
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,590
Wait for me.

281
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,060
That must hurt.

282
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:45,440
They're new, that's why.

283
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,970
Can't you give up on heels?

284
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,560
The heels are an extension of the legs.

285
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:52,740
True. I wore heels all the time in my 20s.

286
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:55,250
They'll kill your knees. Comfort is the best.

287

Did I just sound super old?

00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,290
I'm glad you know.

Aren't they the same thing?

294
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,860
I don't like it.

295
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:25,830
Will there be many staff members?

296
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,780
I don't like having too many people.

297
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:30,800
It's okay. I'll take care of it.

298
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:41,650
Are you okay?

299
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:44,850
I'm fine.

300
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,760
- Let me see. Is it... - No.

301
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,760
- Is it bad? - No.

302
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,450
Are you okay?

303
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:06,640
Wait right here.

304
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,050
Leave it. I'll do it.

305
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,350
It's not heavy.

306
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,890
Exactly. So let me do it.

307
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:23,820
You won't die if a man helps you, will you?

308
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:26,170
It's my job. It really isn't heavy.

309
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,940
Let go. I'll do it. I'll put it there.

310
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:34,540
Should I suspect?

311
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,300
Should I get the wrong idea?

312
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:40,180
Is it weird if I'm nice?

313
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:42,190
Very. Extremely.

314
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,260
Come to think of it,

315
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,190
I ran into you unexpectedly many times.

316
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,120
Talk about luck.

317
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,260
You mean bad luck.

318
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:55,470
Bad luck?

319
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:59,040
Don't hate me so much.

320
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:03,010
It's harder to hate someone than it is to like someone.

321
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:06,940
What does that mean?

322
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,750
Well...

323
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:17,340
You have a bruise on your forehead.

324
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:29,730
What is this?

325
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:40,870
I almost got the wrong idea.

326
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:42,570
Darn it.

327
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,280
I said to wait there.

328
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,490
What is that?

329
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:58,550
Your heel must hurt a lot.

330
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:04,200
Why do you care about my heel? This is awkward.

331
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:11,170
Right? I may put it on wrong.

332
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:16,870
I'll just take these.

333
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:19,950
Just be a colleague.

334
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,220
Okay.

335
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:30,460
He just doesn't get it.

336
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,000
What a bother.

337
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:40,770
Chunhang confirmed the order 2,000 of strawberry-flavored toothpaste.

338
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:43,560
Kiwi confirmed 1,000 orders of cotton-soft...

339
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,770
baby wipes.

340
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,400
Hold on.

341
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,010
Just toothpaste.

342
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,680
Yes.

343
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:55,490
Can you brush your teeth with just toothpaste?

344
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:57,610
- No, sir. - Then what you do need?

345
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:00,050
I need toothpaste.

346
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:03,350
If you know that...

347
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:05,850
I'll give you another chance.

348
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:08,530
Try to tack on toothbrushes too.

349
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:10,120
Yes, sir.

350
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:13,270
What did I tell you?

351
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:15,670
Sales are all about networking.

352
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,800
Visit a customer twice instead of once.

353
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:20,800
You need to check every little thing...

354
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,280
in fine detail.

355
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:25,280
- Don't forget. - No, sir, I won't.

356
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:31,220
Just earlier, Ms. Choi Hyo Joo had a cut on her right heel,

357
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:34,260
so I ran over and bought her a band aid.

358
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,050
Why you...

359
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:44,090
I teach you 1 thing, and you learn 10.

360
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,710
Good job.

361
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,400
Customers are important too, but your reputation at work...

362
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:55,140
shouldn't be ignored. Particularly...

363
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,780
the editors.

364
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,780
I told you, they're comrades as well as enemies.

365
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,750
You need to make sure they are on your side.

366
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,460
Yes, sir.

367
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,370
What is this? What does she wear?

368
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,530
What are you doing at home? Is today a special day?

369
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:51,230
No. Do Ah's poop got on my clothes.

370
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:53,890
What a good daughter. She made her dad shower.

371
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:55,300
Is she sleeping?

372
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:56,860
Yes.

373
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:59,130
I don't see your laundry.

374
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,210
We should do our own laundry.

375
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:07,070
We shouldn't make someone else do it for us.

376
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:11,080
Anyway, I need to start working again.

377
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:13,580
But I'm worried because Do Ah is so young.

378
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:17,290
I can't just leave her at a daycare center all day.

379
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,050
My goodness, my back.

380
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:24,230
I think I have a herniated disk.

381
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:27,060
Child abuse is a big issue these days.

382
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,300
So I can't seem to trust anyone.

383
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,130
It'd be great if I could leave her with someone I know.

384
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:36,570
Why does my wrist hurt so much?

385
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,750
I think I have carpal terminal syndrome.

386
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:41,020
Are you going on a trip?

387
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:44,920
It's carpal tunnel syndrome.

388
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:47,690
Oh, right. Yes, that's what it is.

389
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:51,150
You're right. You shouldn't overwork yourself at your age.

390
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,760
Raising a baby isn't an easy job.

391
00:25:57,170 --> 00:25:59,470
I feel like it's become harder to raise kids than before.

392
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:01,940
I don't do much, but it's still very tiring.

393
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:07,100
I used to carry Ha Ri on my back when I used to run my own business.

394
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,540
It was tiring, but Ha Ri was adorable back then.

395
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:13,450
She was gentle, and she always smiled.

396
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:17,920
Kids grow up so quickly, but that memory lasts a lifetime.

397
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:22,930
I can babysit Do Ah from time to time,

398
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:25,320
but you can't expect me to take care of her all the time.

399
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,320
No one will care for your child better than yourself.

400
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:32,290
The time you spend with her now will stay with you forever.

401
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:57,190
(From: The Best Donor, Why don't we meet up and talk?)

402
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:31,820
Anyway, an unmarried woman...

403
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:34,390
can't find a sperm donor in Korea.

404
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,170
Welcome.

405
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:08,770
Excuse me.

406
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,360
Are you The Best Donor?

407
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:16,560
Yes, hello. I'm The Best Donor.

408
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:18,780
Take a seat.

409
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:21,750
I'm 180cm tall.

410
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,790
My IQ is 148. My blood type is O.

411
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:28,350
I was in the special forces.

412
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:30,890
I'm a student at Hanguk University.

413
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:35,660
I can assure you that I have the best-quality sperm.

414
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,830
The best quality. Right.

415
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,330
I'll take that. Thanks.

416
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,570
Gosh, that's hot.

417
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,940
Well...

418
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:48,410
The thing is,

419
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:52,480
I haven't decided to receive your sperm yet.

420
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:56,350
But I'd like to know how this all works.

421
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:58,050
It's like a preliminary investigation.

422
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:01,690
I'm a journalist, so I feel the urge to investigate.

423
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:02,790
You're a journalist?

424
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:07,230
No, I'm not a news journalist.

425
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,760
I work at a magazine company.

426
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,930
You know those magazines you see at hair salons?

427
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:12,700
I won't publish an article.

428
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:15,500
But still...

429
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:19,140
I should know how it works...

430
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:21,270
before I decide to take your sperm.

431
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,840
Can you tell me how you plan to give me your sperm...

432
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,350
and if it's safe?

433
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:29,550
I'm sure it's not for free.

434
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:35,520
I do this with a sense of duty...

435
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:38,090
for those who desperately wish to have babies.

436
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:41,030
Sperm donation is the same thing as organ donation.

437
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:42,700
One saves lives,

438
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:45,430
and the other creates lives. They're both equally important.

439
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:48,370
So I only receive...

440
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:51,400
10,000 dollars.

441
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:55,070
- 10,000 dollars? - Yes.

442
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:58,680
I do it until you get pregnant. It's not enough, is it?

443
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,850
Do you get requests from a lot of people?

444
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:04,020
As you can see, I have the best genes.

445
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:06,750
So, women agree to take my sperm as soon as they see me.

446
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:11,190
Then you must have a lot of unknown children.

447
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:23,100
I can't do this job if I think of it that way.

448
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:25,940
Yes, you're right.

449
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:27,640
Exactly.

450
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:31,680
And it's very important to give birth to a healthy baby.

451
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:35,680
So instead of doing an IVF or artificial insemination,

452
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:40,550
a lot of women prefer to get naturally pregnant.

453
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,590
- "Naturally pregnant"? - Yes.

454
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:46,760
I sleep with women every night...

455
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:49,000
during their ovulation period.

456
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:52,330
- "Every night"? - Yes, that's right.

457
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:54,700
It's hard to get a woman pregnant in one try.

458
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:57,000
This is a very tiring job for me.

459
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:00,410
But I think of it as doing you guys a favor.

460
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:03,640
If you're interested, let me know.

461
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,180
And I noticed...

462
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:12,320
that you're my type. I'll treat you nicely.

463
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:13,850
Every night.

464
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:19,130
You darn punk. Have you gone crazy?

465
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:21,060
What is in your darn head?

466
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:23,760
Stay right there. I'm going to call the cops.

467
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,500
Has this middle-aged lady lost her mind?

468
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,170
What did you just call me?

469
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:31,600
You told me you have good eyesight. That was a lie, wasn't it?

470
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,210
You don't go to Hanguk University either, do you?

471
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:35,840
You should be ashamed of yourself.

472
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,110
- I'll teach you a lesson. - You wanted my sperm.

473
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:40,410
So why should I be ashamed of myself?

474
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:42,550
Be quiet. I'm calling the cops.

475
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:45,120
- Give me that. - Hey! Hey!

476
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,250
Hey!

477
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,620
That's you, right? We're the police.

478
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:53,360
Someone reported you for illegal sperm donation and forgery.

479
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,830
You impersonated a Hanguk University student, right?

480
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:57,100
- Let's go to the police station. - No.

481
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,230
I'm glad you're here.

482
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,470
I was just about to call you guys.

483
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:04,000
Hurry up and take him. This guy is a bad seed.

484
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,400
You need to come with us as well.

485
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:08,070
Me? Why?

486
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:10,410
You got caught trying to make a deal.

487
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:11,880
I didn't buy anything.

488
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:15,080
I'm serious. I didn't even get to see his sperm.

489
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,720
- Bye then. - Do you want to get handcuffed?

490
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:25,730
Did you bring a car?

491
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,460
Let's go.

492
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:29,500
There he is.

493
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:31,230
How do you feel right now?

494
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:32,800
Get out of the way. Move.

495
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,100
- Let's go. - Tell us how you feel.

496
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,340
- How do you feel? - Tell us what you think.

497
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,770
We're from the TV show...

498
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:39,140
called "Unbelievable Incidents".

499
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,870
- Can you tell us... - I have nothing to say.

500
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:45,850
- Why were you with him? - I feel so wronged.

501
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:47,080
Tell us what happened.

502
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,710
Excuse me.

503
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:50,950
Tell us why you feel wronged.

504
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:54,850
Sir, I was really scared.

505
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:58,120
I was scared that he might be in some kind of a crime syndicate.

506
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:04,000
I went there to do my job as a journalist.

507
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:07,030
Look at my hands. They're shaking.

508
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:10,940
I'm not brave enough to break the law.

509
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:17,980
You must have a high arrest rate.

510
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:20,180
Live a normal life.

511
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:21,910
What's a normal life?

512
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:24,580
Stick to the law and live like everyone else.

513
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,290
Of course, I should stick to the law.

514
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:30,420
But sometimes, the law can't guarantee an individual's happiness.

515
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:34,590
Ms. Jang, if you keep talking back, the investigation will last longer.

516
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:38,030
I didn't exactly talk back.

517
00:33:58,050 --> 00:33:59,120
Hey.

518
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:02,020
(Hanguk University College of Medicine, Yoon Jae Young)

519
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:04,320
I'm Yoon Jae Young. I'm here to guarantee her identity.

520
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,590
- Are you a lawyer? - No, I'm a doctor.

521
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:08,090
I'm a pediatrician.

522
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:15,770
Did you say something to her?

523
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:19,840
(Hanguk University Hospital, Yoon Jae Young)

524
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:23,410
You really are a pediatrician at Hanguk University Hospital.

525
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:28,680
You're the one...

526
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,150
who contacted the scumbag...

527
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,750
from the online community for infertile patients.

528
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:34,220
Be honest and tell me why you contacted him.

529
00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:35,590
Like I said...

530
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:40,260
I proved that I'm a doctor,

531
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:42,860
but I have no proof that you're a cop.

532
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:47,470
She was at the exchange site which is only circumstantial evidence.

533
00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:50,700
But instead of getting a witness statement from her,

534
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:52,970
you're questioning her as if she's the perp.

535
00:34:53,970 --> 00:34:56,280
Did you give him any money?

536
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,680
I'd rather help the unfortunate if I had any to spare.

537
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:00,550
See?

538
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:04,050
She's a curious woman with a tendency to take action,

539
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:06,050
not one who'd be involved in an illicit crime.

540
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:09,920
Didn't you receive numerous prizes for good conduct as a kid?

541
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,320
Yes, I led the volunteer club.

542
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:14,790
Con artists are basically good people too.

543
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:17,300
You may have to investigate to know about her,

544
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:20,270
but I already know her all too well.

545
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:23,800
It's why I vouch for her.

546
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:31,310
Are you sure you were working undercover?

547
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:34,050
Yes.

548
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:35,680
All right.

549
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,220
There was no money transaction, and I vouched for her.

550
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,220
May we go now?

551
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:44,690
Her identity has been vouched for,

552
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,530
so you may go.

553
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:49,160
Come on. Let's go.

554
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,000
Sure thing.

555
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:56,000
Look at you with your head held up high.

556
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,870
Well, I did nothing wrong.

557
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:59,840
You're a brazen one, aren't you?

558
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:03,040
You're not good at a lot of things, but lying is at the top of the list.

559
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:05,310
What do you mean you are an undercover journalist?

560
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:07,280
What were you going to do with that sperm-selling jerk?

561
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:12,080
I'm going to have a baby.

562
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:16,360
What? With a 24-year-old?

563
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:19,690
Say that you love him, and I'll kill you.

564
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:20,890
It's not like that.

565
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:23,260
He offered up his sperm.

566
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:26,670
But for 10,000 dollars. Sounds like a scam, right?

567
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:29,500
You were going to buy his sperm?

568
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:32,140
Do Ah's asleep, so keep it down.

569
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:37,580
This is a new kind of crazy, even for you.

570
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,250
Did not being able to get married drive you to insanity?

571
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:45,250
I want to have a baby without getting married.

572
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:49,320
Forget it.

573
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:51,420
It's not like you'd understand,

574
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,930
and I don't expect you to.

575
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:56,830
You've gone crazy.

576
00:36:57,130 --> 00:37:00,000
I know that it comes with all sorts of ethical problems.

577
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:02,370
But isn't it weird...

578
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:06,210
that only a pregnancy by a married couple is deemed ethical?

579
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:09,980
Sperm can't be donated to unmarried women.

580
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:12,680
So you thought of a way to get it done yourself?

581
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:16,080
Well, I did my research.

582
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:21,350
I don't know what to do with you.

583
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,690
It's not my intention to break the law to get pregnant.

584
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,230
I know I shouldn't have even thought about it,

585
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:30,630
and I'm sorry.

586
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,900
Aren't you sorry for wanting a baby alone?

587
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:38,540
I understand why you don't want to get married...

588
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:40,140
and that you adore kids.

589
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:41,510
But can't you...

590
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:45,280
just get married and have children and live an ordinary life?

591
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,880
I'm doing this to have an ordinary life.

592
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:50,650
I'm 39.

593
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,390
I still hope to meet...

594
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:56,120
the man of my dreams as soon as I step outside those doors.

595
00:37:56,220 --> 00:38:00,190
But my reality is, I'm being called an old lady.

596
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:05,430
I don't know what qualifies as normal or ordinary,

597
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:08,070
but I don't want to give up on my dreams...

598
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:09,600
because people can frown upon me.

599
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,240
Should I be complacent and live with what life throws at me?

600
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:18,010
39 is way too young for that.

601
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:34,530
Unbelievable.

602
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:37,430
How can you bring Do Ah out without a blanket?

603
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:38,500
She's probably cold.

604
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,070
Here you go.

605
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:43,300
Hold the jacket. You've got to be kidding me.

They're the same.

No, his is bigger.

I want what he has.

Wait. Guys, no.

- Hold on. - Don't fight.

- Look at this. - Are you kidding me?

615
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,430
Come on, let's go.

616
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:57,580
Goodness me.

617
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:01,280
Here you go. Please don't cry.

618
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:04,880
You're okay. Enough with the tears.

619
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,950
Who can watch the baby?

620
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:10,120
Can someone take the baby?

621
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:12,620
- Here. - I don't even hold my own nephew.

622
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:15,890
- The baby... - My arm's killing me.

623
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:17,160
Out of the blue?

624
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:20,230
Can't anyone look after the baby?

625
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:23,140
- Oh, no. - I'm here.

626
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:31,840
Ms. Jang, the baby's crying.

627
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,450
What are you so scared about?

628
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:40,390
If the baby's crying,

629
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:42,520
all you have to do is rock it gently.

630
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:45,590
Was it that upsetting? I hear you.

631
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:48,890
Who did this to you? Goodness.

632
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,100
There you go.

633
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:35,510
It's like she came to the rescue.

634
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,450
- Guys. - Over here!

635
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:51,490
- There you go. - How sweet.

636
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:54,130
- Just a little bit more. - Good.

637
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:56,930
Can you face each other? Delicious, isn't it?

638
00:41:56,930 --> 00:41:58,100
Turn only your heads this way.

639
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:59,900
Yes, just the heads.

640
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:03,200
Good job. Could you face this way?

641
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,500
You too, sweetie. There we go.

642
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,410
There we go. Nice!

643
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:09,170
Offer it to each other.

644
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,940
Can you look this way?

645
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:12,980
Over here.

646
00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:15,310
Ha Woon, let's have you turn around.

647
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,350
Now look at the camera guy.

648
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,220
Here you go.

649
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:25,120
What?

650
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,830
- I'll buy the beer. - No.

651
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:34,630
- Am I buying the meal too? - No.

652
00:42:40,370 --> 00:42:42,340
Thank you for helping with the photo shoot.

653
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:43,780
Bingo.

654
00:42:48,210 --> 00:42:49,250
Why do you hate kids?

655
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:52,320
Not everyone has to like kids.

656
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:55,920
I just want to know if there's a particular reason.

657
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:57,120
There isn't.

658
00:42:57,290 --> 00:42:59,730
What if you need help with the kids like you did today?

659
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:02,290
It's not like I can come to the rescue every time.

660
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:06,060
How about you get some practice while working with us?

661
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:07,470
Does practice make perfect?

662
00:43:07,470 --> 00:43:08,800
Yes, of course.

663
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:12,570
Find something to adore, and you'll adore that person.

664
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,740
Trying to like someone will make it real.

665
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:16,940
You hating kids might be the key factor.

666
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:20,410
- Do you want me? - Will my answer change your mind?

667
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:22,450
- No. - I knew it.

668
00:43:26,590 --> 00:43:28,190
Can I ask you a personal question?

669
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:30,360
Do I want to stay single because I hate kids?

670
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,430
- How did you know I'd ask that? - You were building up to it.

671
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:35,730
I see you get asked this a lot.

672
00:43:35,830 --> 00:43:37,030
Let's say that I do.

673
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:40,070
What if you meet someone you love?

674
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:42,930
And what if there's an unexpected pregnancy?

675
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:44,940
That won't happen.

676
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,710
I may not seem that way,

677
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:50,380
but the wall I have up are fairly thick.

678
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:54,710
So you've never once wanted to be a dad?

679
00:43:56,450 --> 00:43:58,480
No. Never. Not even once.

680
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:06,220
Let me see.

681
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:11,000
Where are all my clothes?

682
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:17,340
Here it is.

683
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:20,240
When did Mom last do the laundry?

684
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:21,770
Seriously.

685
00:44:26,910 --> 00:44:28,050
What is this?

686
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:33,990
What is all this?

687
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:38,560
That little...

688
00:44:39,790 --> 00:44:41,590
Jae Young, you're dead.

689
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:46,730
- Are you leaving? - No.

690
00:45:01,010 --> 00:45:03,680
I get to use my self-defense skills.

691
00:45:05,250 --> 00:45:09,020
Hey. Why are you beating him up first thing in the morning?

692
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:13,090
I need to teach this punk a lesson.

693
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:15,030
You cuckoo punk.

694
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:17,560
How dare you put your dirty laundry in my hamper?

695
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:19,100
I know you go through my stuff.

696
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:20,200
What did you steal?

697
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:24,270
I thought you'd do at least that much for me.

698
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:28,610
I helped you out with your undercover project.

699
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:34,780
Do you think that was easy?

700
00:45:35,710 --> 00:45:36,820
Hey.

701
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:40,790
How dare you throw that tiny, disgusting trotter?

702
00:45:41,350 --> 00:45:42,620
This is wrinkled.

703
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:46,060
You should've told me if you had laundry. I would've run it for you.

704
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:49,860
You said you'd do your own laundry. Just put it in the hamper.

705
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:51,900
- Come have breakfast. - Okay.

706
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:54,800
Should I remove my laundry from the hamper?

707
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:58,570
Hey. Just leave it. It's fine!

708
00:45:58,570 --> 00:45:59,700
- Let go. - Brother.

709
00:46:00,110 --> 00:46:03,180
- I shall wash your laundry for you. - Fine. Let go.

710
00:46:10,050 --> 00:46:12,480
That annoying cuckoo punk.

711
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:20,830
Auntie!

712
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:24,560
Wait for me. Come on.

713
00:46:25,930 --> 00:46:27,930
- Isn't it so cold? - Sure.

714
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:34,970
Auntie. Have you had breakfast? Auntie?

715
00:46:34,970 --> 00:46:36,780
Yes, I did.

716
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:39,780
- Have a nice day. - Going up.

717
00:46:41,110 --> 00:46:42,210
Hello.

718
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:46,220
Auntie. Lunch in the cafeteria today?

719
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:48,020
Sure.

720
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:53,230
- Have a nice day. See you later. - Going up.

721
00:46:55,030 --> 00:46:56,960
That's right. Auntie. We have a company dinner tonight.

722
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,030
You're going, right?

723
00:46:58,700 --> 00:46:59,760
I'm not sure.

724
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,230
Okay. You're going.

725
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:06,400
Have a nice day. What a great morning.

726
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:11,280
That's right. Auntie, you...

727
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:19,380
Eu Ddeum. There are no aunties at work.

728
00:47:21,850 --> 00:47:24,690
There are only bosses, bosses, and bosses. Understood?

729
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:27,930
Okay.

730
00:47:35,070 --> 00:47:36,130
Going up.

731
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:38,400
What was that?

732
00:47:54,650 --> 00:47:56,050
Look over there.

733
00:47:58,020 --> 00:48:00,030
(Why was she meeting a sperm donor con artist?)

734
00:48:06,530 --> 00:48:09,130
Auntie. I mean, she looks like you, Ms. Jang.

735
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:13,810
I feel so wrongly accused.

736
00:48:13,810 --> 00:48:15,510
So tell us.

737
00:48:15,510 --> 00:48:17,210
Please tell us.

738
00:48:17,210 --> 00:48:18,280
No pictures.

739
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:23,110
Drink. Drink up. Let's drink.

740
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:25,080
This woman who claims she was just curious.

741
00:48:25,850 --> 00:48:26,990
She's single.

742
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:30,160
Plus, she is a reporter at a magazine.

743
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:33,260
She stated that she was doing an undercover investigation.

744
00:48:33,530 --> 00:48:36,130
However, our findings show...

745
00:48:36,130 --> 00:48:39,100
that the magazine is not doing an undercover investigation.

746
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:40,700
This is unfair.

747
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:43,130
I only contacted him out of curiosity.

748
00:48:43,130 --> 00:48:45,370
He said his sperm was superior...

749
00:48:45,370 --> 00:48:46,640
I didn't buy it!

750
00:48:46,710 --> 00:48:48,510
I didn't even get to see it.

751
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:50,910
How could that be me?

752
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:54,110
How could that be me? That's absurd.

753
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:58,050
Yes. The bruise on your forehead. It's the same.

754
00:48:58,050 --> 00:49:01,090
Why did this woman, who is a reporter,

755
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:04,390
- meet this man... - My stomach...

756
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:07,990
- My stomach. - It's there.

757
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:11,330
- My stomach. - We want to know.

758
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:12,560
Gosh.

759
00:49:32,450 --> 00:49:33,550
Mom.

760
00:49:34,850 --> 00:49:35,950
Come in.

761
00:49:52,570 --> 00:49:55,470
- Mom. - Why you...

762
00:49:55,470 --> 00:49:57,550
You tried to buy what illegally?

763
00:49:57,550 --> 00:50:00,780
Is life too boring? Do you want to go to jail?

764
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:04,420
Auntie. You should hear her out before you hit her.

765
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:05,990
She was undercover.

766
00:50:05,990 --> 00:50:08,860
You know how reporters go in secretly and investigate a story.

767
00:50:08,990 --> 00:50:10,260
She's amazing.

768
00:50:15,050 --> 00:50:17,170
Is that right? Is it?

769
00:50:17,970 --> 00:50:19,260
Yes.

770
00:50:19,630 --> 00:50:21,030
Your face says otherwise.

771
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:23,260
Tell me the truth.

772
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:25,010
Did you try to buy sperm?

773
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:27,280
Why would you buy sperm?

774
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:31,400
Mom.

775
00:50:35,570 --> 00:50:38,280
I'm thinking of getting a sperm donor and having a baby.

776
00:50:40,610 --> 00:50:43,650
I'm sorry for upsetting you, but I won't get married.

777
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:47,400
It's not like getting married guarantees happiness.

778
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:49,090
And... Mom, I...

779
00:50:51,470 --> 00:50:54,440
You'll have a baby by yourself without getting married?

780
00:50:54,570 --> 00:50:56,030
You want to be a single mom?

781
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:59,110
- Mom... - Do you know how hard it is...

782
00:50:59,110 --> 00:51:01,510
to raise a child alone? Have you gone mad?

783
00:51:01,970 --> 00:51:05,280
I raised you alone, so my heart aches for single moms.

784
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:09,170
But people don't try to understand why you're doing it alone.

785
00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:11,190
Even if they see a single mom walking by,

786
00:51:11,190 --> 00:51:13,760
they criticize her and say she's tough and has bad luck.

787
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,760
It was bad enough I had to hear that. Why should you?

788
00:51:19,150 --> 00:51:20,630
Then should I...

789
00:51:21,630 --> 00:51:23,090
live alone for the rest of my life?

790
00:51:28,170 --> 00:51:29,360
If I don't get married?

791
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:31,610
If you're gone?

792
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:34,710
Should I live just for myself?

793
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:37,280
You say you live for me.

794
00:51:38,710 --> 00:51:41,880
Should I live alone without any family,

795
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:44,190
living just for myself, and then die alone?

796
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:51,880
I want to live for someone too.

797
00:51:58,720 --> 00:51:59,990
You crazy witch.

798
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:03,510
You saw how I lived.

799
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:07,340
How could you even think about having a kid alone?

800
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:09,740
You should think about being happily married!

801
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:13,610
You raised me just fine without a husband.

802
00:52:14,070 --> 00:52:16,570
No. It was hard even when Dad was around.

803
00:52:17,690 --> 00:52:20,320
I grew up watching you and Dad fight all the time.

804
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:23,260
You only showed me that marriage makes you sad.

805
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:24,780
Why are you telling me to do something you couldn't?

806
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,360
Is it my fault you're not married?

807
00:52:26,650 --> 00:52:28,900
Did I tell you to learn from me?

808
00:52:29,150 --> 00:52:30,860
Why is it my fault that your life is messed up?

809
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:32,400
Why is my life messed up?

810
00:52:34,170 --> 00:52:35,860
Is it messed up not to get married in case...

811
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:37,570
- I end up like you? - Hey.

812
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:39,570
That's enough.

813
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:43,610
Auntie. Calm down. Let's talk about it tomorrow.

814
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:46,050
Get out.

815
00:52:46,050 --> 00:52:49,110
Don't learn from me and ruin your life.

816
00:52:49,470 --> 00:52:52,740
You're smart, so get out and live as you want.

817
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:55,650
Get out. Get out.

818
00:52:56,010 --> 00:52:57,590
Get out right now! Get out.

819
00:52:58,460 --> 00:52:59,630
Wait outside.

820
00:54:06,130 --> 00:54:08,590
- Are you okay? - Yes.

821
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:43,460
Don't cry.

822
00:54:48,690 --> 00:54:50,190
What are you doing?

823
00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:56,170
You said this is what I should do when someone cries.

824
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:02,740
I'm not a kid.

825
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:06,920
You look like one right now.

826
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:30,010
Thanks.

827
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:39,510
Please don't ask me what happened.

828
00:55:39,990 --> 00:55:41,280
I wasn't going to.

829
00:55:41,690 --> 00:55:44,030
I figured it might be too embarrassing for you.

830
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:47,900
I'm so pathetic.

831
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:52,360
I'm about to turn 40, but I'm still so immature.

832
00:55:53,170 --> 00:55:54,470
You're good as long as...

833
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:57,440
you didn't run outside after you got scolded by your mom.

834
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:01,840
I'm 41.

835
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:05,070
But I still don't know what it means to be an adult.

836
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:08,970
My body keeps aging, but my heart is still young.

837
00:56:10,110 --> 00:56:12,010
When I see something nice, I want to have it.

838
00:56:12,220 --> 00:56:14,260
When someone offends me, I get angry.

839
00:56:14,690 --> 00:56:16,550
When I suffer a loss, I feel upset.

840
00:56:17,630 --> 00:56:19,650
I still feel everything I felt as a kid.

841
00:56:20,030 --> 00:56:21,800
So I don't get what's so different about being 40.

842
00:56:25,570 --> 00:56:27,740
There's nothing good about aging.

843
00:56:28,340 --> 00:56:31,400
But if I have to choose, I guess the only good thing...

844
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:34,610
is that I have a better judgment of character.

845
00:56:38,070 --> 00:56:40,880
Even if you were that weird lady on TV,

846
00:56:42,650 --> 00:56:43,670
I know for a fact...

847
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:51,190
that you're a good person.

848
00:56:54,190 --> 00:56:55,400
Ha Ri.

849
00:57:09,210 --> 00:57:11,470
What are you doing out here after fighting with your mom?

850
00:57:12,050 --> 00:57:13,740
I didn't fight with my mom.

851
00:57:17,650 --> 00:57:18,690
We meet again.

852
00:57:20,010 --> 00:57:22,380
You didn't have to come looking for me. I was going to go home.

853
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:24,650
Why did you wear my slippers?

854
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:26,530
They're expensive. They're my favorite.

855
00:57:26,530 --> 00:57:27,630
Hurry up and wear your shoes.

856
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:34,190
What are you doing?

857
00:57:38,070 --> 00:57:40,070
What? Hurry up so we can go home.

858
00:57:42,740 --> 00:57:43,840
Let's go.

859
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:46,740
We live together.

860
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:49,720
- What are you saying? - Let's go.

861
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:52,420
Why are you so loud?

862
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:53,880
- I'm not loud. - Be quiet!

863
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:55,220
I'm the quietest person on earth.

864
00:58:13,070 --> 00:58:16,070
I can't believe you were talking to a guy after you ran out like that.

865
00:58:16,170 --> 00:58:18,340
Do you really have to say it like that?

866
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:21,070
I've had enough for today. Let's just walk home quietly.

867
00:58:31,220 --> 00:58:32,860
I'm not being sarcastic.

868
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:35,900
Don't care about what others say.

869
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:39,990
I'm just saying you should do whatever you want...

870
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:41,860
regardless of what others might think.

871
00:58:42,970 --> 00:58:45,110
What's with you? I'll see you.

872
00:58:45,670 --> 00:58:47,070
I quit working at the hospital.

873
00:58:50,380 --> 00:58:52,150
But you still have some time until your leave is over.

874
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:53,740
I thought you wanted to become a professor.

875
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:57,420
I won't have time to do lectures, treat patients,

876
00:58:57,420 --> 00:58:59,420
and write theses.

877
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:03,150
I feel so upset that I can't get to do what I wanted.

878
00:59:04,590 --> 00:59:06,550
But what can I do? I'll just have to get by.

879
00:59:07,990 --> 00:59:09,590
How exactly?

880
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:10,990
I'm going to open up a hospital...

881
00:59:10,990 --> 00:59:12,170
with the money I got from selling my apartment.

882
00:59:12,690 --> 00:59:14,440
That's why I moved into your place.

883
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:19,210
I've been wasting away my life after I was left with Do Ah.

884
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:21,780
But funnily enough, I found myself...

885
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:23,670
gaining strength from her.

886
00:59:26,570 --> 00:59:28,610
I know it's hard for me to fully understand you.

887
00:59:29,510 --> 00:59:31,720
But if you need someone,

888
00:59:32,190 --> 00:59:34,280
and you want that to be a baby, I'd understand.

889
00:59:40,190 --> 00:59:41,360
I'm also a dad.

890
00:59:42,090 --> 00:59:45,030
And you're probably doing your best to get by just like me.

891
00:59:48,670 --> 00:59:49,900
I'll publish an interview about your hospital...

892
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:51,210
to congratulate your grand opening.

893
00:59:51,570 --> 00:59:53,970
It'll be a series. You can give medical consultations.

894
00:59:53,970 --> 00:59:55,110
Sure.

895
00:59:56,170 --> 00:59:57,880
But wait a minute.

896
00:59:58,240 --> 00:59:59,550
I will...

897
01:00:01,780 --> 01:00:03,440
do it if you let Do Ah participate.

898
01:00:04,110 --> 01:00:05,110
Mr. Yoon.

899
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:08,280
Not everyone thinks Do Ah is adorable.

900
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:11,050
What are you talking about? She takes after me.

901
01:00:11,050 --> 01:00:13,780
- That's her flaw. Now, go home. - My goodness.

902
01:00:29,110 --> 01:00:31,510
I'm going to go do an interview.

903
01:00:31,510 --> 01:00:34,110
Where are you going? You have something to tell me.

904
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:37,440
- No, I don't. - Yes, you do.

905
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:38,550
Go inside the meeting room.

906
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:40,240
Hey, wait.

907
01:00:40,510 --> 01:00:42,990
You didn't shoot the probiotics ad yet, did you?

908
01:00:43,050 --> 01:00:44,530
- Why? - They want a doctor...

909
01:00:44,530 --> 01:00:45,650
to recommend the product.

910
01:00:45,820 --> 01:00:47,130
You know a pediatrician, right?

911
01:00:47,130 --> 01:00:50,030
Yes, of course. I know a very nice pediatrician.

912
01:00:51,070 --> 01:00:52,190
I'll go bring him.

913
01:00:54,590 --> 01:00:56,260
Why don't you just call?

914
01:00:57,630 --> 01:00:59,010
Does she prefer to meet people face to face?

915
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:01,510
Don't ask.

916
01:01:06,340 --> 01:01:07,420
Okay, great.

917
01:01:08,570 --> 01:01:09,720
How does it look?

918
01:01:10,150 --> 01:01:12,010
- It looks fine. - Seung Ho.

919
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:13,550
Bring the doctor.

920
01:01:13,820 --> 01:01:16,050
Sir, we're going to do a test shoot.

921
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:19,550
Come this way and stand right here.

922
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:22,420
- Thank you. - Tell me the truth.

923
01:01:22,550 --> 01:01:25,070
You were that woman who tried to buy sperm, right?

924
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:26,990
No.

925
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:30,130
You're a very adventurous woman.

926
01:01:30,260 --> 01:01:31,740
Are you going to keep looking for someone's sperm?

927
01:01:32,170 --> 01:01:34,710
Why don't you just sleep with someone?

928
01:01:35,070 --> 01:01:38,050
Then things will get too complicated.

929
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,610
It'll be a problem even if the guy offers to be the father.

930
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:42,880
And if I have the baby without telling him,

931
01:01:43,150 --> 01:01:44,510
I might go to the fiery pit.

932
01:01:44,510 --> 01:01:46,150
That's against moral ethics.

933
01:01:47,610 --> 01:01:49,820
I just want to get someone's sperm with their consent...

934
01:01:50,220 --> 01:01:52,150
and have a baby.

935
01:01:52,460 --> 01:01:53,960
What? Like in Hollywood movies?

936
01:01:54,590 --> 01:01:56,820
They get it from a drunk colleague or a friend.

937
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:04,260
I don't know any guys.

938
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:05,860
- Hello. - My goodness.

939
01:02:05,860 --> 01:02:08,170
This is the product. It takes you straight to the bathroom.

940
01:02:08,170 --> 01:02:10,070
- Oh, I see. - Here. Take a look.

941
01:03:19,450 --> 01:03:22,270
(Oh My Baby)

942
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:23,890
Don't look her way.

943
01:03:23,890 --> 01:03:25,490
The look in her eyes is telling me...

944
01:03:25,490 --> 01:03:27,100
that a crazy idea is forming inside her head.

945
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:28,740
Acknowledge her now and you'll be in trouble.

946
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:30,470
Where are you three going?

947
01:03:30,470 --> 01:03:32,430
Why would two friends be living together?

948
01:03:32,430 --> 01:03:33,810
It's not wrong at all, you know.

949
01:03:34,140 --> 01:03:36,640
Especially given our close relationship.

950
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:38,040
He's a dangerous one.

951
01:03:38,140 --> 01:03:39,470
He looks like a con artist.

952
01:03:39,470 --> 01:03:41,850
You think I'll fall for a bad boy...

953
01:03:41,850 --> 01:03:43,740
and burn myself?

954
01:03:43,740 --> 01:03:45,080
Only make mistakes with me, okay?

955
01:03:45,350 --> 01:03:48,060
I don't want you to fall for some random guy because you're lonely.

956
01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:51,620
Younger specimens would have better sperms, right?
