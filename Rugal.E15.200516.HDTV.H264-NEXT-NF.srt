<b>It's not like I wanted to do it.</b>

70

71

<b>What makes you so sure

91
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,460
<b>Just make sure you finish him

<b>Gi-beom came by again last night.

<b>-And?
-Tae-woong is okay,</b>

95

<b>but Gi-beom pulled the chip
out of the back of his neck.</b>

96
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:09,590
<b>Tae-woong said
Gi-beom stirred him up to do just that,</b>

97

<b>saying he wants to erase everything.</b>

98
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:15,270
<b>Problems with the chip

99
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,310
<b>Yes, they received treatment together.</b>

100
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,220
<b>My head feels like it's going to explode.</b>

101

<b>What will happen to Gi-beom?</b>

102
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,680
<b>A new chip means he'll forget it all?</b>

103

<b>The memories that are closest to the point
in time when the chip got damaged</b>

<b>will be hardest to restore.</b>

105
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,150
<b>And his artificial eyes

106
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:10,360
<b>so his visual memories
have been wiped out too.</b>

107
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:12,740
<b>"Wiped out"? Until when?</b>

108
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:14,370
<b>That I don't know.</b>

109
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,000
<b>Isn't this too cruel?</b>

110
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:20,620
<b>Remaining a member of Rugal

<b>We have our own lives too.</b>

<b>Or should we not? Like robots?</b>

115
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:33,760
<b>If we aren't seen for a while,

117

<i><b>The harder the task was,</i></b>

<b>I know I called you wishy-washy.</b>

156
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,140
<b>I take it back.</b>

157
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,290
<b>Where did it all go?</b>

158
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:11,420
<b>Beg me to spare your life.</b>

159
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,300
<b>Spare...</b>

160
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,970
<b>Spare my life.</b>

161
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:16,260
<b>Louder!</b>

162
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,930
<b>Please spare...</b>

163
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:22,560
<b>Spare...</b>

164
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:59,300
<b>I'd like to put all of Rugal's activities
on pause for the time being.</b>

165
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,060
<b>-Is there a problem?
-No just for maintenance purposes.</b>

166
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,980
<b>You can't keep Kang Gi-beom under control?</b>

167
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:11,690
<b>I mean, he's the one
who got Hwang Deuk-gu out.</b>

168
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:15,860
<b>Some are saying that Argos Hunters
are actually instigating crimes.</b>

169
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:17,950
<b>If he's a self-destructive weapon,</b>

170
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,700
<b>there are many ways to tame him.</b>

171
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,330
<b>Han Tae-woong and Kang Gi-beom.</b>

172
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,870
<b>Why don't we just lose them
if they can't erase their pasts?</b>

173
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,580
<b>If we get rid of them,</b>

174
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:32,710
<b>Rugal can officially become a department
within the National Police Agency.</b>

175
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:37,760
<b>And if you make an appearance
at a few national events,</b>

176
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,350
<b>all the criticism will be gone in no time.</b>

177
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,000
<b>Are you all right?</b>

178
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:11,750
<b>I just fainted. That's all.</b>

179
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,340
<b>Don't give me that. I saw you in pain.</b>

180
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,380
<b>I'm really okay now.</b>

181
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:21,180
<b>Did you say
Tae-woong stepped out with Gi-beom?</b>

182
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:23,260
<b>Yes.</b>

183
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:25,470
<b>He said he felt cooped up.</b>

184
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:28,770
<b>But if he woke up...</b>

185
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,400
<b>I would've known, but I felt nothing.</b>

186
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,650
<b>Maybe it's because the chip was switched.</b>

187
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:39,320
<b>It's a good thing then. I'm relieved.</b>

188
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:41,110
<b>Is it really a good thing?</b>

189
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,200
<b>That much pain I could easily endure.</b>

190
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:48,330
<b>Over my dead body.</b>

191
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,080
<b>The police are here.</b>

192
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:55,040
<b>-What?
-How?</b>

193
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:56,500
<b>It's like someone let them in.</b>

194
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,810
<b>Where's Han Tae-woong?</b>

195
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:09,770
<b>A douche with no manners, I see.</b>

196
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:12,980
<b>You can't just barge in here unannounced.</b>

197
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:18,740
<b>POLICE</b>

198
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,530
<b>-Lee Gwang-cheol?
-So?</b>

199
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:25,620
<b>And you're Song Mi-na.</b>

200
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:29,160
<b>You know who we are,
so I guess there's no reason to play nice.</b>

201
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:33,210
<b>We're not here for you two,
so just tell us where Han Tae-woong is.</b>

202
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:37,550
<b>I'm right here.</b>

203
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:41,090
<b>Being a cop doesn't give you a free pass.</b>

204
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,840
<b>Where's your warrant?</b>

205
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:44,840
<b>Explain yourselves.</b>

206
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:46,550
<b>I authorized it.</b>

207
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,270
<b>Chief?</b>

208
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:53,390
<b>Why?</b>

209
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:57,860
<b>As of this moment,
Rugal will be closed indefinitely.</b>

210
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:00,740
<b>What is he saying?</b>

211
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:04,610
<b>You're closing us down?
Why? What did we do wrong?</b>

212
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,570
<b>That's not the reason.</b>

213
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:09,660
<b>Then why are you already
waving the white flag?</b>

214
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:13,250
<b>-Chief?
-Will the two of us being arrested</b>

215
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:16,880
<b>-solve the issue?
-I must be arrested too?</b>

216
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:22,420
<b>The rest will be commended
and compensated for your service.</b>

217
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:24,880
<b>As if we'd want that.
I won't let anyone take them.</b>

218
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:26,640
<b>How does any of this make sense?</b>

219
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,600
<b>Chief!</b>

220
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:33,390
<b>Guys, we knew this was one of
the scenarios that could play out.</b>

221
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:35,900
<b>I was never informed of this.</b>

222
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:39,360
<b>Trust me and the chief</b>

223
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:41,570
<b>and let them take us.</b>

224
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:45,360
<b>Why would I agree
to an obvious trip to prison?</b>

225
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:46,910
<b>Besides,</b>

226
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:49,370
<b>do you trust him that much?</b>

227
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:54,790
<b>We should trust him blindly?</b>

228
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,380
<b>Even though we could rot in prison?</b>

229
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:07,090
<b>Thanks to that,
obstruction of justice charges were added.</b>

230
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,100
<b>So what'll it be?</b>

231
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,190
<b>Take care of the chief.</b>

232
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:26,650
<b>We won't wait long.</b>

233
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:37,560
<b>So we should trust</b>

234
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,190
<b>how the chief said he'd get them out?</b>

235
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,310
<b>It's impossible. Once they're booked...</b>

236
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:48,950
<b>I hate seeing them behind bars,</b>

237
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,660
<b>but Rugal closing
without a fight is worse.</b>

238
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:55,330
<b>Also, Gi-beom isn't even
in perfect health.</b>

239
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:57,250
<b>He needs to be treated first.</b>

240
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:59,460
<b>Let's wait for the chief's orders.</b>

241
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:01,120
<b>When has waiting worked out for us?</b>

242
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:05,550
<b>We need to take action right now.</b>

243
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:07,630
<b>Tae-woong and I had a hard time</b>

244
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,970
<b>getting Gi-beom out the first time.</b>

245
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:14,220
<b>That's only because
you had to fake his death in the process.</b>

246
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:17,520
<b>It'll be way easier this time.</b>

247
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:21,440
<b>What? Why?</b>

248
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:23,310
<b>Gwang-cheol.</b>

249
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:25,020
<b>You too?</b>

250
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:29,570
<b>What? Why? What's going on?</b>

251
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:31,900
<b>You said it'd be way easier.</b>

252
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:34,240
<b>Yes, compared to back then,</b>

253
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,490
<b>it'd be way easier.</b>

254
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:39,330
<b>It'll be even easier
since they'll only be in a holding cell.</b>

255
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:41,460
<b>So get working on a plan.</b>

256
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:45,880
<b>What the hell are you talking about?</b>

257
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,130
<b>Unbelievable.</b>

258
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,920
<b>Are you both insane?</b>

259
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:52,720
<b>That's right. You've both gone mad.
I won't do this.</b>

260
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,300
<b>Such insanity. Count me out.</b>

261
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:03,730
<b>How is it that you have
zero doubts about this chief?</b>

262
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,980
<b>You were about to take them all out,
so why did you change your mind?</b>

263
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:10,820
<b>What good would taking on the police do</b>

264
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,110
<b>when the real enemy is still out there?</b>

265
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,070
<b>Have your memories come back?</b>

266
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,910
<b>No, it's just a feeling I have.</b>

267
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:22,210
<b>We're under special care.</b>

268
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:25,000
<b>-What does that mean?
-Some may view us as threats.</b>

269
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,500
<b>We're better off being scrapped
when unmanageable.</b>

270
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:31,260
<b>What about the others?</b>

271
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,510
<b>The police will use them as mascots.</b>

272
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:35,470
<b>Are you saying this was foreseen?</b>

273
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,560
<b>I'm sure the chief has a contingency plan.</b>

274
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:50,610
<b>So they'll be on the third floor
of the annex building?</b>

275
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:53,650
<i><b>Yes, it's where
the temporary holding cells are.</i></b>

276
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:56,530
<b>The place dubbed as the torture chamber?</b>

277
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:00,030
<b>Isn't that where you worked?</b>

278
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:02,870
<b>What do you remember about the security?</b>

279
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:07,290
<i><b>Perps who are a higher flight risk
are placed there.</i></b>

280
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,420
<b>Can't we subdue the guards</b>

281
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:12,090
<b>while Tae-woong busts his way out?</b>

282
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:14,170
<b>There's no need to make a commotion.</b>

283
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:17,680
<b>-I can open the doors for you.
-How?</b>

284
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,060
<b>Just take me to the building
and I'll do the rest.</b>

285
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,190
<b>This seems like a big task
for just the three of us.</b>

286
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:29,650
<b>It'll be easier
if we had help from the inside.</b>

287
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,570
<b>We know who can help.</b>

288
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:38,740
<b>Let's go then.</b>

289
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:52,650
<b>What the hell?
What's wrong with these guys?</b>

290
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:02,280
<b>Tae-woong.</b>

291
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:05,450
<b>Your memories are back.</b>

292
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:07,660
<b>Yes.</b>

293
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:21,680
<b>Tae-woong, are you okay?</b>

294
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,140
<b>-Gwang-cheol.
-Yes.</b>

295
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:24,720
<b>This is crazy.</b>

296
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,100
<b>Where should I shoot first?</b>

297
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:30,310
<b>Your brain isn't a robot too, is it?</b>

298
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,230
<b>Goodbye,</b>

299
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,400
<b>Kang Gi-beom.</b>

300
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:38,480
<b>The devil behind all this.</b>

301
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,570
<b>Then why did you never tell me
that she was alive?</b>

302
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:43,910
<b>If everything went as planned,</b>

303
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:46,580
<b>we wouldn't be having this conversation.</b>

304
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,540
<b>Why didn't you tell me?</b>

305
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:50,250
<b>The past doesn't matter.</b>

306
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:52,870
<b>You're a part of Rugal now.</b>

307
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,830
<b>Don't forget your duties.</b>

308
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:59,670
<b>All that you have believed in
will start to crumble.</b>

309
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:25,360
<i><b>The one I need to take my revenge on</i></b>

310
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,280
<b>is you,</b>

311
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:29,330
<b>Choi Geun-cheol.</b>

312
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:33,540
<b>And the one who concealed it.</b>

313
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:38,380
<b>Only one would send these men after us.</b>

314
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:41,210
<b>But how did he know we were here?</b>

315
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,920
<b>Choi Geun-cheol and Hwang Deuk-gu.</b>

316
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:45,550
<b>We'll beat the answers out of them.</b>

317
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:58,440
<b>We'll begin right away.</b>

318
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:20,750
<b>Bradley, I said you didn't have to hide.
Is this really necessary?</b>

319
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:24,090
<b>Hey, unlike you, I need extra precautions.</b>

320
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,260
<b>You just never take risks, do you?</b>

321
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:29,090
<b>He's gone.</b>

322
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,010
<b>-Is he?
-Yes.</b>

323
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:34,600
<b>It was getting stuffy back there.</b>

324
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,980
<b>-Let's begin.
-Sure.</b>

325
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:42,150
<b>Would Detective Yang be all right?</b>

326
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,530
<b>I heard he was reprimanded.</b>

327
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:46,450
<b>He's somewhat part of Rugal anyway,
so who can he complain to?</b>

328
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:51,240
<b>It seems as though
you're talking about me in a way.</b>

329
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:54,080
<b>I wonder why you think so.</b>

330
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:56,620
<b>Just do your job, okay?</b>

331
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:59,630
<b>I'm Bradley, aren't I? I never mess up.</b>

332
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:02,290
<b>All right, then.</b>

333
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:04,460
<b>Let's get the guys out.</b>

334
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,220
<b>Has Rugal really been dismantled?</b>

335
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,720
<b>Does it make me a bastard
for being relieved</b>

336
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,020
<b>of Gi-beom's memory loss?</b>

337
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,940
<b>It's only temporary.</b>

338
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:23,020
<b>His memories will come back to him.</b>

339
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:25,280
<b>Of course...</b>

340
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,280
<b>and they should.</b>

341
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,950
<b>I'm sure you heard</b>

342
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:31,280
<b>about Yeo-jin.</b>

343
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:33,490
<b>Yes.</b>

344
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:36,950
<b>He'll never forgive me now.</b>

345
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:38,660
<b>Mun-bok,</b>

346
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,500
<b>are you willing to do anything</b>

347
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:44,130
<b>to help Gi-beom?</b>

348
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:49,340
<b>Chief Choi should've told me
about what he did to me</b>

349
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,340
<b>when I escaped the hospital,</b>

350
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:53,930
<b>or at least when I had recovered</b>

351
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:55,390
<b>from my surgery.</b>

352
00:34:55,930 --> 00:34:57,850
<b>The same goes for
how Yeo-jin was still alive.</b>

353
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,190
<b>I was only used to serve his purpose.</b>

354
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:02,610
<b>Your story</b>

355
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,940
<b>might be just that as well.</b>

356
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:08,820
<b>Did you actually see
who killed your sister?</b>

357
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:12,160
<b>I know it's hard to believe,</b>

358
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:13,990
<b>but something went down that day.</b>

359
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:16,240
<b>Revenge is what brought me this far too,</b>

360
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:17,200
<b>but you heard him.</b>

361
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:21,330
<b>We could've been used in the same way.</b>

362
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:32,380
<b>ARE YOU READY FOR YOUR SECOND ESCAPE?</b>

363
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:35,430
<b>I'm being asked if we're ready to escape.</b>

364
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:38,220
<b>By the chief?</b>

365
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:40,980
<b>IT'S ME, BRADLEY</b>

366
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:42,140
<b>No, by Bradley.</b>

367
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:46,270
<b>I'M HERE WITH THE MEMBERS OF RUGAL</b>

368
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:48,820
<b>Mi-na and Gwang-cheol are here too.</b>

369
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:51,950
<b>Things are going to get fun.</b>

370
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:55,370
<b>CAN'T PROVIDE AUDIO</b>

371
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:57,790
<b>SO FOLLOW THE ESCAPE ROUTE</b>

372
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,540
<b>Shall we? I'll guide the way.</b>

373
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:08,880
<b>What the hell?</b>

374
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:23,390
<b>Nice. Good job.</b>

375
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,440
<b>The doors will keep opening,</b>

376
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,150
<b>so don't make any pit stops.</b>

377
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:05,190
<b>Oh, dear.</b>

378
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:08,020
<b>-Can't open the door?
-It's not that,</b>

379
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:09,650
<b>but they can take a detour.</b>

380
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:46,770
<b>Gi-beom.</b>

381
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,240
<b>Gwang-cheol, they're coming out the back.</b>

382
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:05,700
<b>Not the front?</b>

383
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:06,830
<b>No, so move.</b>

384
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:07,920
<b>Got it.</b>

385
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:13,300
<b>-Don't tell me that--
-I'm getting Gi-beom out of here.</b>

386
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,550
<b>-What?
-This is your chance.</b>

387
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:35,280
<b>Over there. Get them!</b>

388
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:37,650
<b>-There!
-Get them!</b>

389
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:56,760
<b>Let's go.</b>

390
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:04,720
<b>Move!</b>

391
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:06,060
<b>Open these doors.</b>

392
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:08,730
<b>-Let us out.
-Move!</b>

393
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,690
<i><b>Where are Han Tae-woong and Kang Gi-beom?</i></b>

394
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,690
<b>Where did you hide them, damn it?</b>

395
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,400
<b>What are you talking about?</b>

396
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,610
<i><b>It wasn't just me.</i></b>

397
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:19,190
<b>You wanted them arrested too!</b>

398
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,070
<b>Han Tae-woong was to be tamed
and Kang Gi-beom punished!</b>

399
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,530
<b>If this is such a pressing matter,</b>

400
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:26,240
<b>issue an APB out on them.</b>

401
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:17,460
<b>What's going on?</b>

402
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,050
<b>Was it just the three of you?</b>

403
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:22,050
<b>Yes.</b>

404
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:26,470
<b>Do you still not see
who threw us to the wolves?</b>

405
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,850
<b>I want to ask the chief face to face.</b>

406
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,480
<b>Me too.</b>

407
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:36,310
<b>Then do so. I'll look for Dr. Oh.</b>

408
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,810
<b>I'll come with you.</b>

409
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:40,150
<b>I have another request

410
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,820
<b>Me too?</b>

411
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:44,570
<b>Tae-woong and I are fugitives

<b>I won't be able to hide if Choi Geun-cheol
brings Rugal back on line</b>

413
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,330
<b>which is why I need you to keep me hidden.</b>

414
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:52,120
<b>You want us back in the lion's den?</b>

415
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:56,920
<b>How's the chip?
Do you need any medical assistance?</b>

416
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,340
<b>No, not yet.</b>

417
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,840
<b>Do you have Gi-beom's phone?</b>

418
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:01,800
<b>Yes.</b>

419
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:05,550
<b>You'll need it.</b>

420
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,930
<b>This is where we separate.</b>

421
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,890
<b>I'll be in touch.</b>

422
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:18,940
<b>-Let's go.
-Sure.</b>

423
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:19,860
<b>Got it.</b>

424
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:23,090
<b>Give me your phone.</b>

425
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:26,260
<b>I can't do that, ma'am.</b>

426

<b>It's for an important business deal.</b>

427
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:31,640
<b>Do you want to be accountable
for tens of billions of won?</b>

428
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,390
<b>Tell me who it is and I'll make the call.</b>

429
00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:36,930
<b>Do you think they will take your call?</b>

430
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:39,480
<b>It's still a no, ma'am.</b>

431
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:43,690
<b>Then I'll send out a text.
That much is all right.</b>

432

<b>You must stick to texting.</b>

<i><b>Hello?</i></b>

<i><b>You there. Can't you hear me?</i></b>

440

<b>What the hell?</b>

441
00:44:53,070 --> 00:44:56,910
<b>I'm planning to kill them

<b>So how dare you use my private

443
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:03,790
<b>I'm hanging up.</b>

444
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,540
<b>There are so many photos.</b>

445
00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:25,590
<b>When I almost died because of Gi-beom,</b>

446
00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:26,800
<b>Mi-na told me</b>

<b>that I am the target after you.</b>

448

<b>That's when I thought you had died.</b>

449
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,770
<b>I wondered, "Who'd take care

<b>What will happen if I die as well?"</b>

451

<b>So many thoughts crossed my mind.</b>

452

<b>But the most ridiculous thought</b>

453
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:48,530
<b>was that I was the one</b>

<b>who added Gi-beom to this list.</b>

<b>If anything, it's my fault.</b>

457

<b>And it's up to me to correct this.</b>

458
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,210
<b>I helped him escape.</b>

459

<b>I thought that was my way</b>

00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:42,250
<b>We'll go in first.</b>

463
00:46:57,970 --> 00:47:00,480
<i><b>The number you have called is unavailable.
Leave a message.</i></b>

464
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:04,190
<b>I can't reach him.</b>

465
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:08,570
<b>Do you think
he is really trying to abandon us?</b>

466
00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:12,610
<b>He won't do that.</b>

467
00:47:14,070 --> 00:47:17,990
<b>I know that he cares about Rugal
more than anyone else.</b>

468
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:22,460
<b>But it's true that Rugal can go on
without us.</b>

469
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:25,210
<b>Who can replace us?</b>

470
00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:27,630
<b>Perhaps,
Rugal is what he wants to protect,</b>

471
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,130
<b>not us.</b>

472
00:47:30,090 --> 00:47:32,680
<b>I've been having that thought.</b>

473
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,550
<b>It doesn't matter who the members are.</b>

474
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:39,770
<b>Let's not talk more about this
until we can ask him face to face.</b>

475
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:41,640
<b>And</b>

476
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:45,560
<b>there is someone I need to meet
before that.</b>

477
00:47:48,070 --> 00:47:49,980
<b>It could be dangerous,</b>

478
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:51,650
<b>so I'll meet the chief alone.</b>

479
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:53,650
<b>-No, I'd like to--
-This is an order.</b>

00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:01,080
<b>Okay.</b>

481
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:43,450
<b>Hey!</b>

482
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,410

483
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:46,960

484
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:24,910
<b>Who the hell are you?</b>

485
00:49:25,870 --> 00:49:27,370
<b>I'm here to see Chairwoman Choi.</b>

486
00:49:33,710 --> 00:49:34,590
<b>Where is she?</b>

487
00:49:35,550 --> 00:49:38,010
<b>Do you want to tell me now
or after being beaten to a pulp?</b>

488
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:41,470
<b>RESTRICTED AREA</b>

489
00:49:42,970 --> 00:49:44,310
<b>Where's the key?</b>

490
00:49:54,070 --> 00:49:57,190
<b>RESTRICTED AREA</b>

491
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:07,710
<b>Dr. Oh!</b>

492
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:09,540
<b>Gi-beom!</b>

493
00:50:09,670 --> 00:50:10,710
<b>Are you okay?</b>

494
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,250
<b>I'm sorry I'm late.</b>

495
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:13,500
<b>I truly am.</b>

496
00:50:13,790 --> 00:50:15,760
<b>No, don't be. I'm all right.</b>

497
00:50:16,210 --> 00:50:18,340
<b>How did you know I'd be here?</b>

498
00:50:18,510 --> 00:50:21,340
<b>I came because Choi Ye-won
had contacted me.</b>

499
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:24,810
<b>I think Hwang Deuk-gu got to her.</b>

500
00:50:25,310 --> 00:50:27,270
<b>I'm certain
she's somewhere in this building.</b>

501

<b>I'm not sure where, though.</b>

502

<b>But I know you can find her.</b>

503
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:34,770
<b>Let me escort you out first.</b>

504
00:51:23,110 --> 00:51:24,410
<b>Where's your everyone?</b>

505
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:26,740
<b>Why do I only meet a pawn?</b>

506
00:51:27,490 --> 00:51:29,500
<b>How did you get in here?</b>

507
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:33,120
<b>I was looking for something.</b>

508
00:51:41,590 --> 00:51:44,300
<b>You were so bold back at the holding cell.</b>

509
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:47,930
<b>But now, you look petrified.</b>

510
00:51:49,970 --> 00:51:51,350
<b>I'm just disgusted</b>

511
00:51:52,270 --> 00:51:53,730
<b>by everything you've done.</b>

512
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:55,650
<b>Bring it on.</b>

513
00:52:06,910 --> 00:52:09,330
<b>Hey, did you get it?</b>

514
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:17,590
<b>The police shouldn't know about this.</b>

515
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:19,460
<b>We are the only ones who know.</b>

516
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,430
<b>I'll meet you there later.</b>

517
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:26,260
<b>Yes, sir.</b>

518

520
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:22,020
<b>How did you escape?</b>

521
00:53:22,110 --> 00:53:23,440
<b>When we were in custody,</b>

522

<b>the guys who looked like
Hwang Deuk-gu's test subjects</b>

527

<b>Okay.</b>

537

<b>Gi-beom has found Dr. Oh.</b>

<b>Had he been in custody,
he wouldn't have found him.</b>

00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:33,760

547
00:54:44,650 --> 00:54:45,980
<b>Of course.</b>

548
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:49,860
<b>By the way, I received a new chip.</b>
