1
00:00:05,815 --> 00:00:08,692
(Jambi Studio)

2
00:00:17,824 --> 00:00:19,444
Just a second.

3
00:00:22,624 --> 00:00:25,345
How long do we need to do this? I'm getting cramps on my face.

4
00:00:26,134 --> 00:00:27,254
Don't look her way.

5
00:00:28,435 --> 00:00:30,035
The look in her eyes is telling me...

6
00:00:30,035 --> 00:00:31,604
that a crazy idea is forming inside her head.

7
00:00:31,604 --> 00:00:33,324
Acknowledge her now, and you'll be in trouble.

8
00:00:33,374 --> 00:00:35,625
Why? Why will we be in trouble?

9
00:00:35,975 --> 00:00:37,665
There's no safe zone around Jang Ha Ri.

10
00:00:40,785 --> 00:00:43,335
I didn't do anything wrong.

11
00:00:43,384 --> 00:00:44,705
I'm a bit scared.

12
00:00:46,185 --> 00:00:48,705
Since you think you're fine, why don't you deal with her?

13
00:00:51,494 --> 00:00:52,845
Is that really necessary?

14
00:00:54,795 --> 00:00:56,974
I should leave before she talks to me.

15
00:01:02,065 --> 00:01:05,354
Okay, we'll start shooting now.

16
00:01:05,705 --> 00:01:08,705
Loosen up. Bring your shoulders down.

17
00:01:08,705 --> 00:01:11,165
Put your chin down. Look into the camera lens.

18
00:01:11,414 --> 00:01:13,115
1, 2, 3. Let's see you smile.

19
00:01:13,115 --> 00:01:14,695
One more time.

20
00:01:15,345 --> 00:01:16,464
Yoon Jae Young.

21
00:01:16,744 --> 00:01:19,904
He may sound rough, but he has a nice personality.

22
00:01:20,054 --> 00:01:22,005
If my baby takes after him, it'll be smart.

23
00:01:24,255 --> 00:01:25,255
No.

24
00:01:25,255 --> 00:01:28,245
He's too much like a brother.

25
00:01:31,134 --> 00:01:32,245
Han I Sang.

26
00:01:32,695 --> 00:01:35,335
He seems to have a bad personality,

27
00:01:35,335 --> 00:01:37,324
but he's sometimes kind as well.

28
00:01:37,574 --> 00:01:40,154
I like his curiosity and how challenging he is.

29
00:01:41,244 --> 00:01:43,964
No, I won't be able to tell him.

30
00:01:46,274 --> 00:01:47,794
Choi Kang Eu Ddeum.

31
00:01:50,884 --> 00:01:51,934
What is his deal?

32
00:01:53,115 --> 00:01:54,635
- Great work. - You did great.

33
00:01:54,985 --> 00:01:57,445
- Good work. - Great work.

34
00:01:57,455 --> 00:01:59,255
- Thank you. - See you guys.

35
00:01:59,255 --> 00:02:00,344
What?

36
00:02:01,095 --> 00:02:02,214
You're going?

37
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:03,714
She just left.

38
00:02:05,234 --> 00:02:07,254
- You did great. - You too.

39
00:02:09,965 --> 00:02:11,855
Where are you three going?

40
00:02:17,275 --> 00:02:19,945
I need to go home and take care of Do Ah.

41
00:02:19,945 --> 00:02:21,684
Your mom's probably having a hard time.

42
00:02:21,685 --> 00:02:24,134
I'm going to tell Mr. Kim that the shoot went well.

43
00:02:24,354 --> 00:02:27,474
I need to go to a shoot after lunch. Do you have something to say?

44
00:02:28,354 --> 00:02:30,705
Let me buy you lunch.

45
00:02:31,394 --> 00:02:33,625
That's great. You guys can eat together.

46
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:34,745
- He's right. - Enjoy.

47
00:02:34,995 --> 00:02:36,045
Where are you going?

48
00:02:37,664 --> 00:02:39,444
My mom's free all afternoon.

49
00:02:40,764 --> 00:02:42,015
What's the matter with you?

50
00:02:42,204 --> 00:02:44,855
She can't watch Do Ah all day. She'll be exhausted.

51
00:02:44,905 --> 00:02:48,355
Then don't make her cook for you. Eat lunch with me.

52
00:02:49,074 --> 00:02:51,475
She's right. The three of you can chat...

53
00:02:51,475 --> 00:02:53,174
and have fun together.

54
00:02:53,174 --> 00:02:54,564
Eu Ddeum, you should come with us.

55
00:02:56,014 --> 00:02:58,564
Mr. Kim left to meet a client.

56
00:03:00,315 --> 00:03:02,205
He's probably back by now.

57
00:03:02,285 --> 00:03:04,225
This morning, I heard him say very loudly...

58
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:06,075
that he has a lunch meeting with a client.

59
00:03:07,155 --> 00:03:08,195
- Eu Ddeum. - Yes?

60
00:03:08,195 --> 00:03:09,824
I have a lunch meeting with a client.

61
00:03:09,824 --> 00:03:10,944
I'll be back pretty late.

62
00:03:11,465 --> 00:03:12,714
Sorry. What?

63
00:03:15,364 --> 00:03:17,425
I'm going to be back...

64
00:03:17,704 --> 00:03:19,585
after lunch.

65
00:03:19,805 --> 00:03:21,495
I'm going to have lunch outside.

66
00:03:22,345 --> 00:03:23,425
I'll be back late.

67
00:03:27,174 --> 00:03:28,265
Let's go.

68
00:03:29,315 --> 00:03:30,365
Come on.

69
00:03:35,584 --> 00:03:38,045
Brace yourselves. We'll be okay.

70
00:03:47,405 --> 00:03:50,515
What's going on? Are you picking your future husband?

71
00:03:52,035 --> 00:03:53,525
Let me see.

72
00:03:54,144 --> 00:03:55,525
I choose...

73
00:03:56,345 --> 00:03:57,925
I'll send you a text.

74
00:03:58,345 --> 00:03:59,395
Good luck.

75
00:04:04,215 --> 00:04:05,765
Why isn't anyone sitting beside me?

76
00:04:06,114 --> 00:04:08,034
Right now, we're on the same side.

77
00:04:08,285 --> 00:04:10,975
Why did you suddenly want to eat with us?

78
00:04:11,524 --> 00:04:13,605
I just figured we should be friends.

79
00:04:14,165 --> 00:04:16,964
The three of you got to know each other,

80
00:04:16,964 --> 00:04:19,884
so I think we should take that friendship to another level.

81
00:04:21,704 --> 00:04:23,314
I guess we were scared for nothing.

82
00:04:23,565 --> 00:04:26,285
We became close because we were all scared of you.

83
00:04:26,334 --> 00:04:27,995
You're pretty fearless.

84
00:04:28,175 --> 00:04:30,225
It's because he's young. He doesn't know what's coming.

85
00:04:30,915 --> 00:04:31,965
Am I scary?

86
00:04:32,045 --> 00:04:35,295
Look in the mirror and see your eyes. They're very scary.

87
00:04:36,014 --> 00:04:37,165
Well...

88
00:04:37,584 --> 00:04:40,365
Now that I've aged, I realize that friends are precious.

89
00:04:40,584 --> 00:04:42,855
Let's get together often like this, get close,

90
00:04:42,855 --> 00:04:44,345
and check on each other's health status.

91
00:04:44,795 --> 00:04:48,444
- That being said, Eu Ddeum... - Yes?

92
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:50,415
You seem quite healthy to me.

93
00:04:50,464 --> 00:04:52,184
Does it run in the family?

94
00:04:52,735 --> 00:04:55,715
I doubt your family has had any medical issues.

95
00:04:56,665 --> 00:04:58,274
No one in my family has been sick.

96
00:04:58,274 --> 00:04:59,524
I see.

97
00:05:00,574 --> 00:05:02,574
Meanwhile, my body isn't what it used to be.

98
00:05:02,574 --> 00:05:04,714
They say your body starts to power down...

99
00:05:04,714 --> 00:05:06,214
the moment you hit that 40 mark.

100
00:05:06,214 --> 00:05:10,064
That must be what's happening to me. I ache here and there. Right?

101
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:11,685
That's not the case for me.

102
00:05:11,685 --> 00:05:13,504
- No underlying illnesses? - No.

103
00:05:13,884 --> 00:05:15,204
I see. That's good.

104
00:05:15,884 --> 00:05:19,644
We're at an age where health is a touchy subject for us.

105
00:05:20,224 --> 00:05:22,365
Hangovers aren't cured until the next evening...

106
00:05:22,365 --> 00:05:24,245
and it takes two days to recover from an all-nighter.

107
00:05:24,435 --> 00:05:26,045
So before we're hit with something bad,

108
00:05:26,094 --> 00:05:29,754
we should check our health at least twice a day.

109
00:05:30,365 --> 00:05:33,524
The doctor in me says that you have a liver problem.

110
00:05:33,904 --> 00:05:35,305
You can't have a part of mine though.

111
00:05:35,305 --> 00:05:36,824
It has hardened from all the liquor.

112
00:05:37,945 --> 00:05:39,064
You're out.

113
00:05:39,175 --> 00:05:40,365
Nice!

114
00:05:41,185 --> 00:05:43,535
You two seem like real siblings.

115
00:05:43,815 --> 00:05:45,004
How long have you been friends?

116
00:05:45,255 --> 00:05:46,865
Unfortunately, since in utero.

117
00:05:47,485 --> 00:05:48,675
Our moms were friends.

118
00:05:50,084 --> 00:05:52,704
No wonder you two are like elementary school kids.

119
00:05:53,195 --> 00:05:54,444
You're a polite one, aren't you?

120
00:05:55,094 --> 00:05:56,745
You just bad-mouthed us while holding a smile.

121
00:05:57,894 --> 00:05:59,915
I thought you were cousins.

122
00:06:00,394 --> 00:06:01,485
His aunt's daughter.

123
00:06:01,534 --> 00:06:02,884
You thought we were cousins?

124
00:06:03,264 --> 00:06:05,454
I'm her friend. Her boyfriend.

125
00:06:05,675 --> 00:06:07,855
Her boyfriend? Is he your boyfriend?

126
00:06:07,904 --> 00:06:10,324
No, a friend who's a boy. Don't mix those two up.

127
00:06:12,014 --> 00:06:14,295
Then why do you live together?

128
00:06:14,344 --> 00:06:17,535
- Well, he's putting us out... - Who says we can't?

129
00:06:21,324 --> 00:06:22,405
Especially when...

130
00:06:26,295 --> 00:06:27,745
we're this close?

131
00:06:29,964 --> 00:06:31,745
Yes, you're close enough to be smacked.

132
00:06:32,795 --> 00:06:33,845
Goodness.

133
00:06:34,605 --> 00:06:38,055
Anyway, it's nice to finally get to know you better.

134
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:41,355
Let's keep this up and gradually get to know each other...

135
00:06:41,675 --> 00:06:42,894
even more.

136
00:06:43,074 --> 00:06:44,155
Sounds good.

137
00:06:44,214 --> 00:06:45,675
- Cheers. - Cheers.

138
00:06:45,675 --> 00:06:46,774
Cheers, everyone.

139
00:06:46,774 --> 00:06:49,465
All right. Here you go.

140
00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:56,134
(Episode 4: The Time One Needs to Understand Others)

141
00:06:58,625 --> 00:06:59,675
Stop right there.

142
00:07:06,295 --> 00:07:07,345
Follow me.

143
00:07:10,534 --> 00:07:11,655
Get back here!

144
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,055
I'm sorry.

145
00:07:14,644 --> 00:07:16,074
I know it's something to be frowned upon.

146
00:07:16,074 --> 00:07:17,295
Didn't you know that?

147
00:07:17,545 --> 00:07:19,165
I didn't think I'd get caught.

148
00:07:19,974 --> 00:07:22,365
I understand how it can be frowned upon,

149
00:07:23,315 --> 00:07:27,235
but I don't think what I did was that wrong.

150
00:07:29,855 --> 00:07:33,144
Why should one's marital status make one's decision ethical?

151
00:07:33,195 --> 00:07:35,475
Am I supposed to engage in a debate?

152
00:07:36,094 --> 00:07:39,094
It's easy for everyone to accept how a married couple...

153
00:07:39,094 --> 00:07:40,615
would want a baby.

154
00:07:40,735 --> 00:07:43,684
What many can't accept is considered crazy.

155
00:07:44,605 --> 00:07:46,285
Am I a crazy cow then?

156
00:07:46,474 --> 00:07:47,694
Don't be too shocked by it.

157
00:07:47,844 --> 00:07:49,894
I never once thought you were in your right mind anyway.

158
00:07:50,245 --> 00:07:51,465
That's actually quite comforting.

159
00:07:57,315 --> 00:07:59,235
If you're going to set off a bomb,

160
00:07:59,654 --> 00:08:00,905
make sure the explosion's big.

161
00:08:08,824 --> 00:08:10,545
Are you siding with me?

162
00:08:11,235 --> 00:08:14,584
No. Let's just put it as me understanding how desperate you are.

163
00:08:15,005 --> 00:08:16,314
Just make sure you deal with the mess yourself.

164
00:08:17,974 --> 00:08:19,884
I doubt any harm was done.

165
00:08:20,675 --> 00:08:22,355
Only our people would recognize me anyway.

166
00:08:22,474 --> 00:08:24,865
Exactly. We all recognized you.

167
00:08:28,945 --> 00:08:30,835
- It's her, right? - Yes.

168
00:08:39,895 --> 00:08:41,815
So it's gossip over colleagues.

169
00:08:44,695 --> 00:08:45,815
Ha Ri.

170
00:08:49,734 --> 00:08:50,914
Please enjoy.

171
00:08:52,275 --> 00:08:53,384
Is it true?

172
00:08:54,604 --> 00:08:57,195
- What are people saying? - That it's not your first time...

173
00:08:57,974 --> 00:09:00,725
and that it's how you got pregnant with your first child.

174
00:09:00,775 --> 00:09:02,885
- Did I have a son or daughter? - Daughter.

175
00:09:02,885 --> 00:09:05,634
- Who does she take after? - She's a miniature version of you.

176
00:09:06,055 --> 00:09:07,114
Then she'll be cute.

177
00:09:07,114 --> 00:09:09,735
Hold on. That I didn't hear.

178
00:09:10,994 --> 00:09:13,754
Anyway, I hope that this unknown child of mine...

179
00:09:13,754 --> 00:09:16,174
lives a great life without her mother.

180
00:09:18,265 --> 00:09:20,234
You're going to let people say...

181
00:09:20,234 --> 00:09:22,254
that you abandoned your child?

182
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:27,254
I can't believe she isn't taking this seriously.

183
00:09:28,474 --> 00:09:29,524
Gosh.

184
00:09:37,754 --> 00:09:38,965
If I don't get married?

185
00:09:39,984 --> 00:09:41,304
If you're gone?

186
00:09:42,254 --> 00:09:44,034
Should I live just for myself?

187
00:09:44,895 --> 00:09:46,605
You say you live for me.

188
00:09:47,964 --> 00:09:49,575
Should I live alone without any family,

189
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:53,315
living just for myself, and then die alone?

190
00:09:57,234 --> 00:09:58,654
But you'll be too lonely.

191
00:10:01,145 --> 00:10:02,825
When you're old, everything is upsetting.

192
00:10:05,645 --> 00:10:06,965
If you have no one,

193
00:10:09,015 --> 00:10:10,794
who will take care of you when you're sick?

194
00:10:23,994 --> 00:10:26,044
Auntie, are you drinking?

195
00:10:26,895 --> 00:10:29,154
- You shouldn't. - Shut it...

196
00:10:29,535 --> 00:10:30,654
and get over here.

197
00:10:34,905 --> 00:10:36,054
Jae Young.

198
00:10:37,604 --> 00:10:39,325
What do you think of Ha Ri?

199
00:10:42,084 --> 00:10:44,705
Mom. Can I call you that instead of Auntie?

200
00:10:44,954 --> 00:10:46,935
You seem more like my mom these days.

201
00:10:49,185 --> 00:10:50,584
What are you getting at?

202
00:10:50,584 --> 00:10:52,304
Ha Ri and I have been friends since birth.

203
00:10:52,695 --> 00:10:54,004
We're already family.

204
00:10:54,055 --> 00:10:56,274
And all I want to do is make it official on paper.

205
00:10:56,824 --> 00:10:58,914
Why won't you see Ha Ri as a woman?

206
00:10:59,094 --> 00:11:01,315
She's pretty, kind, humorous,

207
00:11:01,565 --> 00:11:03,014
and charming.

208
00:11:03,405 --> 00:11:04,754
It's hard not to be attracted to her.

209
00:11:05,405 --> 00:11:06,554
I know.

210
00:11:08,604 --> 00:11:10,695
Of course I'm aware that Ha Ri's a catch.

211
00:11:11,574 --> 00:11:12,995
It's why I'm not the man for her.

212
00:11:16,045 --> 00:11:17,164
Come on.

213
00:11:17,714 --> 00:11:21,304
Why would you want her to be with a single father?

214
00:11:22,155 --> 00:11:24,034
She should marry someone...

215
00:11:25,624 --> 00:11:27,504
who is better than me.

216
00:11:29,724 --> 00:11:30,945
Of course she should.

217
00:11:49,484 --> 00:11:50,614
Darn, it hurts.

218
00:11:50,614 --> 00:11:51,804
My gosh!

219
00:11:56,484 --> 00:11:57,945
It hurts.

220
00:12:04,594 --> 00:12:05,745
Seriously?

221
00:12:13,675 --> 00:12:14,794
Here.

222
00:12:15,305 --> 00:12:16,394
Let's go.

223
00:12:17,915 --> 00:12:18,965
We live together.

224
00:12:21,614 --> 00:12:24,015
Then why do you live together?

225
00:12:24,015 --> 00:12:27,304
- Well, he's putting us out... - Who says we can't?

226
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,274
Especially when...

227
00:12:33,454 --> 00:12:34,774
we're this close?

228
00:12:44,535 --> 00:12:47,284
How does this make any sense?

229
00:12:47,535 --> 00:12:50,195
A man and a woman who has a close relationship...

230
00:12:50,504 --> 00:12:52,524
are living in the same house?

231
00:12:52,574 --> 00:12:53,624
Answer me.

232
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:56,465
Why won't you say anything?

233
00:12:57,145 --> 00:12:58,504
Whatever. Forget about it.

234
00:12:59,385 --> 00:13:00,435
Unbelievable.

235
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:13,485
You prepared a feast.

236
00:13:14,364 --> 00:13:15,685
Anyway, thank you.

237
00:13:19,074 --> 00:13:20,685
Everything smells nice.

238
00:13:24,045 --> 00:13:25,924
- Do you want soup? - Yes.

239
00:13:33,515 --> 00:13:34,724
Gosh, it looks delicious.

240
00:13:34,724 --> 00:13:36,134
It sure does.

241
00:13:39,994 --> 00:13:43,215
I'm not saying that I won't ever get married.

242
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:47,035
But realistically speaking, it's too hard to find anyone.

243
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:49,615
There aren't any decent guys around me.

244
00:13:50,234 --> 00:13:53,554
I'm at an age where pregnancy is more urgent...

245
00:13:58,645 --> 00:14:00,965
Mom, I...

246
00:14:04,145 --> 00:14:06,205
Just how dense are you?

247
00:14:14,624 --> 00:14:15,925
Come on.

248
00:14:15,925 --> 00:14:17,544
Just how dense are you?

249
00:14:17,935 --> 00:14:20,144
Grandma's already upset as it is.

250
00:14:20,195 --> 00:14:23,585
What are you doing by adding fuel to the flame?

251
00:14:25,704 --> 00:14:27,784
Use your common sense, Mom.

252
00:14:30,074 --> 00:14:31,294
There's no way I'd choose you.

253
00:14:32,315 --> 00:14:35,134
- What do you mean? - Nothing.

254
00:14:36,844 --> 00:14:37,935
What did you just mean?

255
00:14:38,084 --> 00:14:39,304
Just get back to your meal.

256
00:14:39,555 --> 00:14:40,634
I should eat.

257
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:02,905
(Jambi Studio)

258
00:15:02,905 --> 00:15:04,815
Please put the kids in front.

259
00:15:04,815 --> 00:15:06,595
- Gather round. - Okay.

260
00:15:06,744 --> 00:15:08,344
- Look here, kids. - Look here.

261
00:15:08,344 --> 00:15:10,645
- Look here. Okay. - Right here.

262
00:15:10,645 --> 00:15:11,865
How cute.

263
00:15:12,185 --> 00:15:13,865
Where did you find them?

264
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:15,575
They look just like each other.

265
00:15:15,954 --> 00:15:18,644
With a little creative liberty, they're the genius father and son,

266
00:15:18,854 --> 00:15:20,774
athletic father and son, and artistic mother and daughter.

267
00:15:28,104 --> 00:15:29,654
He looks normal enough.

268
00:15:32,374 --> 00:15:33,554
He's handsome.

269
00:15:34,175 --> 00:15:36,455
He has a sharp nose and nice jawline.

270
00:15:36,604 --> 00:15:37,794
And fair skin.

271
00:15:41,385 --> 00:15:42,794
I hear he's Ha Ri's friend.

272
00:15:44,084 --> 00:15:46,114
Yes. They've been friends since they were babies.

273
00:15:46,114 --> 00:15:49,435
They grew apart when he got married, but they got close again recently.

274
00:15:50,484 --> 00:15:51,745
He's married?

275
00:15:51,854 --> 00:15:53,594
He adored his wife so very much,

276
00:15:53,594 --> 00:15:55,874
that he was so very annoying from what I heard.

277
00:16:00,135 --> 00:16:03,085
He got divorced and moved into her house with his baby.

278
00:16:04,435 --> 00:16:06,675
- He has a baby? - Exactly.

279
00:16:06,675 --> 00:16:08,355
He even has a baby.

280
00:16:09,145 --> 00:16:11,325
He's perfect for her.

281
00:16:11,415 --> 00:16:13,614
He's a doctor. They know everything about each other.

282
00:16:13,614 --> 00:16:15,095
And he has a baby.

283
00:16:17,584 --> 00:16:18,935
He's dangerous.

284
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:21,004
What?

285
00:16:21,315 --> 00:16:22,935
He looks like a total con artist.

286
00:16:25,994 --> 00:16:28,475
Look at him being jealous. You've been made.

287
00:16:53,555 --> 00:16:57,034
When you feel anxious, you tend to make bad moves.

288
00:17:02,964 --> 00:17:05,715
I'm saying this in case you date any guy because you want a baby.

289
00:17:07,264 --> 00:17:08,614
What? Why?

290
00:17:09,165 --> 00:17:11,675
Do you think I'll be immature and fall for a bad guy...

291
00:17:11,675 --> 00:17:13,734
and hop on the express train to suffering?

292
00:17:13,734 --> 00:17:17,425
No. You seem to be in a rush to get married and have a baby.

293
00:17:17,645 --> 00:17:19,064
Feel free to make mistakes on me, though.

294
00:17:21,445 --> 00:17:24,965
Whether or not I date a loser, it's none of your business.

295
00:17:26,385 --> 00:17:28,435
Why would you date a loser?

296
00:17:28,655 --> 00:17:31,135
Are you the type who gets love goggles?

297
00:17:31,155 --> 00:17:33,325
Yes, I can't think straight.

298
00:17:33,325 --> 00:17:35,014
All I see is love.

299
00:17:36,024 --> 00:17:38,844
And once I decide against a guy, I never look back,

300
00:17:39,794 --> 00:17:41,145
so don't worry.

301
00:17:45,675 --> 00:17:47,234
- I'm getting dizzy. - Why?

302
00:17:47,234 --> 00:17:48,495
It's so hard to carry on a conversation.

303
00:17:48,774 --> 00:17:50,044
I need a sugar kick.

304
00:17:50,044 --> 00:17:52,824
- My blood sugar level must be low. - What...

305
00:17:55,085 --> 00:17:56,364
What's his problem?

306
00:17:58,385 --> 00:18:00,735
- How about a punch with a "Yap"? - Yap.

307
00:18:04,155 --> 00:18:05,245
Good.

308
00:18:06,754 --> 00:18:07,844
Like this.

309
00:18:13,135 --> 00:18:14,185
Hold on.

310
00:18:14,865 --> 00:18:17,314
Mommy, I'm so hungry, I can't take it.

311
00:18:17,335 --> 00:18:19,354
Can't I have a hot dog?

312
00:18:26,645 --> 00:18:27,965
He's uncomfortable.

313
00:18:39,754 --> 00:18:41,614
Next Wednesday is the anniversary of Father's passing.

314
00:18:42,564 --> 00:18:44,175
Come. Mother's waiting.

315
00:19:09,925 --> 00:19:11,745
Is it Paris this time?

316
00:19:12,355 --> 00:19:15,074
Father gets to tour the world thanks to you.

317
00:19:15,895 --> 00:19:18,614
Hey. Hey. Wait.

318
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:21,685
Your father drinks water...

319
00:19:22,905 --> 00:19:24,554
before he eats.

320
00:19:34,814 --> 00:19:37,294
- Here. Try this too. - Okay.

321
00:19:37,744 --> 00:19:39,564
- You eat. - Eat up.

322
00:19:41,115 --> 00:19:44,675
Anyway, aren't you going to have a housewarming party?

323
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:46,804
Set a date. Just the adults can come.

324
00:19:47,994 --> 00:19:49,825
- What? - I Sang.

325
00:19:49,825 --> 00:19:51,165
Our kids are well-behaved.

326
00:19:51,165 --> 00:19:52,584
I have a baby at my place.

327
00:19:53,365 --> 00:19:55,314
What? A baby?

328
00:19:59,135 --> 00:20:00,955
Are you living with her?

329
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:03,524
No, Mother.

330
00:20:04,105 --> 00:20:05,925
He means a statue made out of stone.

331
00:20:05,974 --> 00:20:07,064
Stone?

332
00:20:09,014 --> 00:20:10,915
Why are you living with a stone?

333
00:20:10,915 --> 00:20:12,735
I bought it recently from Easter Island.

334
00:20:14,014 --> 00:20:15,334
It's precious to me.

335
00:20:16,655 --> 00:20:19,645
They say if you get attached to pets and figurines,

336
00:20:19,724 --> 00:20:21,245
you won't get married.

337
00:20:21,355 --> 00:20:23,245
That's not good.

338
00:20:24,825 --> 00:20:27,544
Do you want to meet a manager from our company?

339
00:20:27,794 --> 00:20:29,084
She's a successful single woman.

340
00:20:29,734 --> 00:20:32,625
It's time to meet someone new.

341
00:20:36,845 --> 00:20:39,064
No, I'm not very social.

342
00:20:43,115 --> 00:20:46,965
Mother can't sleep well because she's worried about you.

343
00:20:47,784 --> 00:20:49,875
How long will you act like a loser and act like...

344
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:52,504
you're the biggest victim in the world?

345
00:20:52,895 --> 00:20:54,574
Hey. Hey. Don't.

346
00:20:59,865 --> 00:21:01,754
- I'm done. - Hey.

347
00:21:02,365 --> 00:21:03,554
You're not done eating.

348
00:21:04,135 --> 00:21:06,054
- Hey. Hey. - Honey.

349
00:21:06,304 --> 00:21:07,854
That kid.

350
00:21:11,345 --> 00:21:13,794
Uncle. Aren't you marrying In Ah?

351
00:21:14,474 --> 00:21:16,665
Byul, do you still remember In Ah?

352
00:21:16,814 --> 00:21:19,564
In Ah bought me an Elsa dress.

353
00:21:20,254 --> 00:21:21,364
Oh my gosh.

354
00:21:22,224 --> 00:21:25,425
You're so smart. My gosh.

355
00:21:25,425 --> 00:21:29,475
You must be happy that Byul is so smart.

356
00:21:29,665 --> 00:21:32,534
We went to see Cinderella with In Ah.

357
00:21:32,534 --> 00:21:33,885
Byul, shut it.

358
00:21:34,034 --> 00:21:35,554
Uncle's wedding fell through.

359
00:21:35,764 --> 00:21:37,335
In Ah ran away.

360
00:21:37,335 --> 00:21:39,985
In Ah is banned, you stupid moron.

361
00:21:40,034 --> 00:21:43,794
Mommy. He called me a stupid moron.

362
00:21:44,175 --> 00:21:45,324
It's okay.

363
00:21:45,415 --> 00:21:47,725
How could you say that to your little sister?

364
00:21:47,915 --> 00:21:49,064
Watch it!

365
00:21:49,214 --> 00:21:51,145
What did I do wrong?

366
00:21:51,145 --> 00:21:54,034
Quiet down.

367
00:22:03,764 --> 00:22:06,514
Hello. I heard you needed muscle.

368
00:22:07,395 --> 00:22:10,814
We need to get the gift bags for the launch ceremony of "The Mom".

369
00:22:11,064 --> 00:22:13,385
You'll need to make multiple trips.

370
00:22:13,905 --> 00:22:16,125
Hyo Joo. Where are you going?

371
00:22:18,075 --> 00:22:20,395
Excuse me? I have a meeting.

372
00:22:20,774 --> 00:22:22,465
- I'll see you afterward. - No.

373
00:22:23,014 --> 00:22:24,334
You don't have a meeting.

374
00:22:25,284 --> 00:22:27,135
But...

375
00:22:27,454 --> 00:22:30,685
There's a list of gifts there, so don't miss anything.

376
00:22:30,685 --> 00:22:32,804
Don't go 3 times when 2 would've sufficed. Also.

377
00:22:32,954 --> 00:22:35,274
Bring two more bundles of the magazines.

378
00:22:35,695 --> 00:22:36,745
Excuse me?

379
00:22:44,564 --> 00:22:45,685
Who pulls it like that?

380
00:22:47,274 --> 00:22:49,254
Push it like me. It's easier.

381
00:22:50,105 --> 00:22:51,425
Forget it.

382
00:22:53,474 --> 00:22:55,564
I'd like to get it all so you don't have to,

383
00:22:56,814 --> 00:22:59,314
but I know I may be being rude, rather than polite,

384
00:22:59,314 --> 00:23:00,804
to a modern-day working woman.

385
00:23:02,355 --> 00:23:03,804
Who says that?

386
00:23:04,024 --> 00:23:06,445
My mom. She's a feminist.

387
00:23:06,794 --> 00:23:10,064
She told me I shouldn't treat women like they're too weak...

388
00:23:10,064 --> 00:23:12,485
to carry their own bags.

389
00:23:13,435 --> 00:23:15,764
She probably said it because she couldn't stand...

390
00:23:15,764 --> 00:23:18,014
seeing her son carrying his girlfriend's bag.

391
00:23:18,875 --> 00:23:21,155
I'm fine, so pull it for me.

392
00:23:26,175 --> 00:23:27,625
Hello.

393
00:23:31,784 --> 00:23:33,054
Bye. I'll call you.

394
00:23:33,054 --> 00:23:34,314
- Okay. Call me. - Goodbye.

395
00:23:34,314 --> 00:23:35,475
- Have a nice day. - You too.

396
00:23:35,855 --> 00:23:37,774
- Auntie, did you have a meeting? - Bye.

397
00:23:38,085 --> 00:23:39,705
We picked an infertile couple.

398
00:23:40,155 --> 00:23:41,975
- Are you going to the storage room? - Yes.

399
00:23:42,964 --> 00:23:44,145
Are you going to die?

400
00:23:44,165 --> 00:23:47,344
Yes. I think my clothes are going to die soon.

401
00:23:49,034 --> 00:23:51,314
It's the first day it saw the light of day...

402
00:23:53,405 --> 00:23:54,554
Okay.

403
00:23:54,935 --> 00:23:56,995
The storage room is too rough a place for that dress...

404
00:24:01,415 --> 00:24:02,564
I'll go.

405
00:24:05,714 --> 00:24:06,935
Do you mean it?

406
00:24:07,284 --> 00:24:09,905
We can't let the dress die. Let's go.

407
00:24:10,224 --> 00:24:11,375
Okay.

408
00:24:12,024 --> 00:24:13,175
See you.

409
00:24:14,524 --> 00:24:15,975
I can't stand him.

410
00:24:18,595 --> 00:24:21,445
Ms. Jang, should I take this down too?

411
00:24:21,695 --> 00:24:23,655
Be careful.

412
00:24:24,435 --> 00:24:27,024
Don't worry. I used to work at a warehouse,

413
00:24:27,474 --> 00:24:28,754
so I'm used to this.

414
00:24:28,905 --> 00:24:32,165
At a warehouse? You look like you didn't work a day in your life.

415
00:24:32,214 --> 00:24:33,524
It was when I was looking for a job.

416
00:24:34,115 --> 00:24:36,135
I'm glad I worked there. It's coming in handy.

417
00:24:36,685 --> 00:24:37,764
What should I do with these?

418
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:40,064
Let's just take two.

419
00:24:52,635 --> 00:24:53,685
Okay.

420
00:25:07,445 --> 00:25:08,524
Yes.

421
00:25:09,714 --> 00:25:13,034
The younger they are, the more fertile they'll be.

422
00:25:15,185 --> 00:25:16,534
- What? - What?

423
00:25:20,832 --> 00:25:22,011
Yes.

424
00:25:23,081 --> 00:25:26,402
The younger they are, the more fertile they'll be.

425
00:25:28,581 --> 00:25:29,902
- What? - What?

426
00:25:34,392 --> 00:25:35,742
I was talking about strength.

427
00:25:35,862 --> 00:25:38,712
I meant to say you must have great stamina.

428
00:25:39,301 --> 00:25:42,982
You're young and healthy, so you're probably very active.

429
00:25:43,031 --> 00:25:45,152
And that leads to a high success rate...

430
00:25:48,172 --> 00:25:49,422
"A high success rate"?

431
00:25:50,241 --> 00:25:53,361
I mean, there's a high probability that you'll succeed in life...

432
00:25:54,142 --> 00:25:56,732
because you're healthy.

433
00:25:57,311 --> 00:25:59,801
Both your body and mind.

434
00:26:01,352 --> 00:26:02,672
Thank you, Ms. Jang.

435
00:26:03,152 --> 00:26:05,611
Ms. Jang, is there anything else you need me to help you with?

436
00:26:05,761 --> 00:26:08,611
I'll gladly help you out with my healthy body.

437
00:26:09,132 --> 00:26:11,491
Let's take a few more toys.

438
00:26:11,491 --> 00:26:13,512
Toys? Okay. You got it.

439
00:26:19,142 --> 00:26:20,801
People love that photo.

440
00:26:20,801 --> 00:26:22,162
Do you think they'll keep working with you?

441
00:26:22,612 --> 00:26:23,962
There's no reason not to.

442
00:26:24,811 --> 00:26:25,861
You're right.

443
00:26:26,112 --> 00:26:28,692
Whoever works with you always wants you back.

444
00:26:29,051 --> 00:26:31,202
So I'm going to do the same and ask you to keep working with us.

445
00:26:32,952 --> 00:26:34,432
Gosh, no way.

446
00:26:34,821 --> 00:26:37,402
I'm sick of working with babies.

447
00:26:48,301 --> 00:26:50,022
Excuse me. Sorry.

448
00:26:51,432 --> 00:26:53,791
This is killing me. My entire body aches.

449
00:26:54,872 --> 00:26:56,311
I'll go get you some medicine.

450
00:26:56,311 --> 00:26:57,642
No, it's okay.

451
00:26:57,642 --> 00:27:00,662
My body's just telling me that it's tired.

452
00:27:01,041 --> 00:27:02,631
You don't need to take it too seriously.

453
00:27:03,912 --> 00:27:05,622
You might feel okay right now,

454
00:27:05,622 --> 00:27:07,702
but that might not be the case tomorrow.

455
00:27:07,882 --> 00:27:11,442
It's better to take medicine at your age.

456
00:27:12,261 --> 00:27:13,942
I'm not that old.

457
00:27:14,162 --> 00:27:16,381
Gosh, your pain shows that you're a middle-aged woman.

458
00:27:16,962 --> 00:27:18,281
Should I beat him up?

459
00:27:18,662 --> 00:27:20,281
Wait here. I'll be right back.

460
00:27:20,331 --> 00:27:21,381
Just a second.

461
00:27:35,581 --> 00:27:37,801
Do you think you can take the elevator?

462
00:27:40,182 --> 00:27:43,202
The elevator is packed.

463
00:27:44,491 --> 00:27:46,442
Follow me, okay?

464
00:27:48,491 --> 00:27:49,831
Excuse me.

465
00:27:49,831 --> 00:27:51,641
Can you please make some space?

466
00:27:51,791 --> 00:27:53,731
My mom is too old,

467
00:27:53,731 --> 00:27:55,982
and her body is aching all over.

468
00:27:56,031 --> 00:27:57,621
I may be young,

469
00:27:57,702 --> 00:28:00,492
but my mom is old.

470
00:28:00,741 --> 00:28:02,522
Please do us a favor and let us in.

471
00:28:04,741 --> 00:28:06,591
I can't handle this kid.

472
00:28:08,442 --> 00:28:11,631
(Nex Beer)

473
00:28:14,152 --> 00:28:16,571
- You have to kick it properly. - Just eat.

474
00:28:16,892 --> 00:28:18,772
Hey, kids.

475
00:28:20,622 --> 00:28:23,091
Trash belongs in the trash can.

476
00:28:23,091 --> 00:28:24,581
You sound like my dad.

477
00:28:24,991 --> 00:28:26,581
Who are you to get involved?

478
00:28:27,862 --> 00:28:30,231
Just let them be. They're not going to listen.

479
00:28:30,231 --> 00:28:31,422
Let's just go.

480
00:28:37,712 --> 00:28:38,821
What are you doing?

481
00:28:39,511 --> 00:28:41,762
- Kids. - What are you doing?

482
00:28:42,041 --> 00:28:43,861
Don't film us!

483
00:28:43,912 --> 00:28:46,801
Who do you think you are?

484
00:28:47,051 --> 00:28:49,041
Me? I'm an adult.

485
00:28:50,922 --> 00:28:53,012
You're like an annoying uncle.

486
00:28:53,091 --> 00:28:54,821
Gosh, I can't take this anymore.

487
00:28:54,821 --> 00:28:56,311
Let's just go already.

488
00:28:57,362 --> 00:28:59,111
Hey, just get lost.

489
00:28:59,462 --> 00:29:00,512
Okay?

490
00:29:01,632 --> 00:29:05,381
Kids, just pick up your trash and throw it in the trash can.

491
00:29:05,602 --> 00:29:08,152
Let's give this video a nice ending.

492
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:10,492
What's his problem?

493
00:29:11,672 --> 00:29:13,492
- What are you doing? - Hey.

494
00:29:15,112 --> 00:29:16,361
"Kim Ho Jin".

495
00:29:16,652 --> 00:29:19,031
- "Yoon Nam Joon." - Stop filming us!

496
00:29:19,521 --> 00:29:20,571
Give it!

497
00:29:20,722 --> 00:29:22,772
- Grab him! - Get his cell phone!

00:29:35,731 --> 00:29:37,452
- Oh, my back. - Are you okay?

502
00:29:39,341 --> 00:29:40,391
I'm sorry.

503
00:29:42,341 --> 00:29:43,692
Are you okay?

504
00:29:46,841 --> 00:29:49,101
I heard your first son got married.

505
00:29:49,652 --> 00:29:51,232
I didn't know about the wedding.

506
00:29:51,712 --> 00:29:53,902
Didn't I send you a big sum of congratulatory money?

507
00:29:54,581 --> 00:29:57,402
Yes, it's fine. But what about your second son?

508
00:29:58,321 --> 00:30:00,742
Oh, he's married already?

509
00:30:01,422 --> 00:30:04,381
Your eldest son, the math teacher.

510
00:30:05,392 --> 00:30:08,012
Did he get a divorce by any chance?

511
00:30:09,031 --> 00:30:10,321
No?

(Jong Gu's mother, Hair salon...)

513

My gosh, when did I ever reject your son?

514
00:30:14,801 --> 00:30:16,462
I said we should set them up once he gets a job.

515
00:30:17,942 --> 00:30:19,232
He's still jobless?

516
00:30:19,412 --> 00:30:21,861
(Jong Gu's mother, Hair salon...)

517
00:30:22,912 --> 00:30:24,131
My gosh, there's no one.

518
00:30:46,902 --> 00:30:48,351
What can I help you with?

519
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:53,492
I'd like you to help me...

520
00:30:53,741 --> 00:30:57,202
do something for my daughter.

521
00:30:58,112 --> 00:31:00,831
- Pardon? - I have a lot of money.

522
00:31:01,981 --> 00:31:04,521
So I'm thinking of making a savings account...

523
00:31:04,521 --> 00:31:06,571
or invest in some mutual funds for her.

524
00:31:07,162 --> 00:31:08,672
Let me take a look.

525
00:31:13,331 --> 00:31:15,012
You have a great first impression.

526
00:31:15,972 --> 00:31:17,152
Are you married?

527
00:31:17,301 --> 00:31:18,621
No, not yet.

528
00:31:20,142 --> 00:31:21,321
Is that so?

529
00:31:24,271 --> 00:31:26,662
Hello? Diapers?

530
00:31:27,311 --> 00:31:28,831
Okay. See you.

531
00:31:31,551 --> 00:31:32,902
You must have a niece or a nephew.

532
00:31:33,922 --> 00:31:35,101
I have a son.

533
00:31:36,291 --> 00:31:39,041
My wife gave birth before we could get married.

534
00:31:42,222 --> 00:31:43,881
There's an investment that will guarantee a high profit.

535
00:31:43,991 --> 00:31:45,242
Are you interested?

536
00:31:46,602 --> 00:31:49,551
No, my business here is done.

537
00:31:50,731 --> 00:31:53,301
One. And then,

538

two.

539

- 1, 2, - He's not...

542
00:32:04,781 --> 00:32:06,122
- 3, 4. - so bad.

543
00:32:06,122 --> 00:32:08,772
And use your thumb.

544
00:32:09,392 --> 00:32:12,512
- 3, 4. - Or maybe I'm wrong.

545
00:32:12,591 --> 00:32:16,091
Okay, that's it for today. Great job, everyone.

No, we're almost done. Why did you want the magazines?

What's the use of keeping them all piled up?

560
00:33:33,741 --> 00:33:35,272
We can send them to community service centers...

561
00:33:35,272 --> 00:33:36,561
and postnatal care centers.

562
00:33:36,812 --> 00:33:38,211
So Yoon, write up a list for me.

563
00:33:38,211 --> 00:33:39,291
Sure.

564
00:33:40,211 --> 00:33:42,232
We might end up giving too much away.

565
00:33:42,852 --> 00:33:45,502
What do we do? They can't spare an extra vehicle.

566
00:33:45,511 --> 00:33:46,701
They don't have any extras.

567
00:33:47,281 --> 00:33:50,272
- Why not? - Due to waned photoshoots.

Mine is at the auto shop.

573

Then I'll drive my dad's car to work tomorrow.

574
00:34:05,171 --> 00:34:06,322
You have a license?

575
00:34:06,542 --> 00:34:09,022
Yes, but I haven't been on the road yet.

576
00:34:12,582 --> 00:34:13,862
Who's the photographer tomorrow?

577
00:34:16,812 --> 00:34:18,402
Can't we call in a favor?

578

Well, it at least...

582

in trash cans.

583
00:34:41,071 --> 00:34:42,522
You...

584

are a grown-up who takes his responsibilities seriously.

585
00:34:46,011 --> 00:34:47,092
Right?

586
00:34:58,151 --> 00:35:00,141
So tell me about tomorrow's photoshoot.

587
00:35:01,792 --> 00:35:03,442
You'll be taking photos of the event.

588

Is this not something you want to do?

I'm just flustered to work with "The Baby" again.

592
00:35:15,301 --> 00:35:18,791
Why do you guys always need so many little favors?

593
00:35:19,111 --> 00:35:22,192
I hate it when professional relationships get blurry.

594
00:35:22,542 --> 00:35:25,812
Aren't we close enough now for me to ask these...

595
00:35:25,812 --> 00:35:26,971
little friendly favors?

596
00:35:28,252 --> 00:35:29,402
Are we?

597
00:35:29,821 --> 00:35:32,172
I thought you didn't want to even look at me anymore.

598
00:35:32,191 --> 00:35:33,641
You're unbelievable.

599
00:35:33,921 --> 00:35:36,382
You took me in your arms when I cried the last time.

600
00:35:36,662 --> 00:35:38,482
Why do that when we're not even close?

601
00:35:40,202 --> 00:35:43,071
When did I take you in my arms?

602
00:35:43,071 --> 00:35:46,052
All I did was pat you on the back while you cried.

603
00:35:47,841 --> 00:35:50,261
I went from hating you to liking you which is even scarier,

604
00:35:50,741 --> 00:35:52,362
but I guess the feeling wasn't mutual.

605

Guys, what took you so long?

617
00:36:42,261 --> 00:36:44,482
Let me show you to your seats. The others aren't here yet.

618
00:36:44,861 --> 00:36:46,752
The other moms won't be here.

619

We came here to tell you where we stand.

00:37:04,252 --> 00:37:05,912
How can a journalist for a baby magazine...

623
00:37:05,912 --> 00:37:08,101
do such a thing? It's unethical.

624
00:37:08,252 --> 00:37:09,452
We can't support the magazine...

625
00:37:09,452 --> 00:37:11,971
when its journalist has questionable morals.

626
00:37:13,162 --> 00:37:14,712
I thought...

627
00:37:15,722 --> 00:37:19,411
that the moms would understand...

628
00:37:19,461 --> 00:37:21,581
my desire to become a mom.

629
00:37:21,631 --> 00:37:23,121
It's why we're taking a stand.

630
00:37:23,432 --> 00:37:25,652
We want children to be raised in an upright environment.

631
00:37:26,031 --> 00:37:27,502
We are aware that there are women...

632
00:37:27,502 --> 00:37:29,372
who wish to raise children while still unmarried.

633
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:32,291
But what about the children who will grow up without a father?

634
00:37:32,511 --> 00:37:34,041
Children aren't toys, you know.

635
00:37:34,042 --> 00:37:35,831
Giving birth just because you want to...

636
00:37:36,651 --> 00:37:37,902
is selfish if you ask me.

637
00:37:38,912 --> 00:37:41,072
How could you do this to your own child?

638
00:37:41,352 --> 00:37:44,241
If you want a family, try getting a dog or a cat instead.

639
00:37:48,892 --> 00:37:50,011
Look here, ladies!

640
00:37:51,562 --> 00:37:53,152
Get a dog instead?

641
00:37:53,162 --> 00:37:55,411
How could you say that to dog lovers?

642
00:37:55,901 --> 00:37:58,982
- Mind your own business. - The dog lover in me can't take it.

643
00:37:59,372 --> 00:38:00,972
It's not your call...

644
00:38:00,972 --> 00:38:02,962
whether or not she raises a dog or a baby.

645
00:38:03,042 --> 00:38:05,962
What did Ms. Jang do anyway? She did nothing wrong.

646
00:38:14,151 --> 00:38:17,002
I apologize for making you all uncomfortable.

647
00:38:19,222 --> 00:38:21,371
I understand your worries...

648
00:38:22,491 --> 00:38:25,011
and you can say that being moms yourselves.

649
00:38:25,861 --> 00:38:26,911
However,

650
00:38:27,732 --> 00:38:30,752
it wasn't my intention to do what you're thinking.

651
00:38:38,841 --> 00:38:41,161
I've been working alongside moms for 15 years,

652
00:38:42,912 --> 00:38:45,402
so I thought I knew how moms would feel.

653
00:38:47,022 --> 00:38:48,201
But I guess...

654
00:38:49,491 --> 00:38:51,701
I was clueless after all.

655
00:38:53,562 --> 00:38:56,612
I wish to learn how it's like to be a mom...

656
00:38:57,232 --> 00:38:58,482
and understand motherhood.

657
00:39:00,531 --> 00:39:03,581
I truly hope I get the chance.

658
00:39:10,042 --> 00:39:12,391
Hold on. Stop that.

659
00:39:13,082 --> 00:39:16,331
What do you mean our supporters declared a boycott?

660
00:39:17,082 --> 00:39:18,402
Where's Ms. Jang?

661
00:39:19,582 --> 00:39:21,302
I ordered her to clean up storage.

662
00:39:21,582 --> 00:39:23,342
We're about to call it a day, so you should talk to her tomorrow.

663
00:39:23,591 --> 00:39:27,041
Ms. Shim, this isn't something you should defend her on.

664
00:39:28,292 --> 00:39:31,011
Goodness. I didn't know I had the power to do that.

665
00:39:31,062 --> 00:39:33,511
I want her in my office as soon as...

666
00:39:33,901 --> 00:39:35,112
she gets to work tomorrow.

667
00:39:37,702 --> 00:39:38,782
Got it?

668
00:39:39,602 --> 00:39:40,692
Yes, sir.

669
00:39:47,741 --> 00:39:48,831
("The Baby" Jang Ha Ri)

670
00:39:50,011 --> 00:39:52,011
The person you have reached is not available.

671
00:39:52,011 --> 00:39:54,032
Please leave a message after the tone.

672
00:40:33,407 --> 00:40:34,756
You weren't at Jo Jo's.

673
00:40:36,637 --> 00:40:38,356
People from work frequent there.

674
00:40:40,706 --> 00:40:41,827
Thank you.

675
00:40:44,416 --> 00:40:45,827
Why were you out looking for me?

676
00:40:46,746 --> 00:40:49,196
Did you think I'd be crying like a kid?

677
00:40:49,956 --> 00:40:51,736
Were you hoping to pat me on the back again?

678
00:40:52,717 --> 00:40:54,537
It's because I needed a drinking buddy.

679
00:40:59,427 --> 00:41:01,117
I have a lot on my mind today.

680
00:41:11,907 --> 00:41:13,396
Why did you lie?

681
00:41:15,746 --> 00:41:17,126
You don't raise dogs.

682
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:19,026
How did you know that?

683
00:41:19,076 --> 00:41:20,836
You would've already talked about your dog if you had one.

684
00:41:21,146 --> 00:41:23,336
My Ddol Ddol was clever, you know.

685
00:41:24,087 --> 00:41:27,236
If only it came back after running away 30 years ago.

686
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:43,926
Will the moms ever understand me?

687
00:41:48,777 --> 00:41:50,626
My parents always argued...

688
00:41:51,076 --> 00:41:52,997
during mealtime.

689
00:41:53,947 --> 00:41:56,767
My dad had to have a cup of water before eating,

690
00:41:57,556 --> 00:42:00,437
but my mom would say that it'll hinder his digestion.

691
00:42:01,527 --> 00:42:02,887
After my father passed away,

692
00:42:02,887 --> 00:42:05,707
she has always served water during his ancestral rite.

693
00:42:06,527 --> 00:42:09,347
She does that even after saying how she couldn't understand...

694
00:42:10,036 --> 00:42:12,216
why he'd do such a thing for 40 years.

695
00:42:18,607 --> 00:42:22,296
One must not understand at first to understand.

696
00:42:27,947 --> 00:42:30,937
If you finally understand someone at one point in your life,

697
00:42:31,717 --> 00:42:33,537
it'll mean that...

698
00:42:33,857 --> 00:42:36,336
you've been thinking about that person throughout that time.

699
00:42:36,527 --> 00:42:39,376
It's a human being, who can't even understand himself,

700
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:41,646
understanding someone else.

701
00:42:43,237 --> 00:42:45,247
And if you really do understand,

702
00:42:46,806 --> 00:42:48,117
your attitude would change.

703
00:42:49,737 --> 00:42:51,526
Although it shouldn't take 40 years.

704
00:42:59,117 --> 00:43:00,167
Why did you come?

705
00:43:01,217 --> 00:43:03,037
I may need to be carried home today.

706
00:43:06,157 --> 00:43:07,477
I have a wide back.

707
00:43:07,587 --> 00:43:08,776
It'll be comfortable.

708
00:43:10,956 --> 00:43:12,146
I don't know about that.

709
00:43:13,297 --> 00:43:14,577
- How about a drink? - Okay.

710
00:43:25,337 --> 00:43:27,256
Mr. Nam was right.

711
00:43:28,007 --> 00:43:29,196
You're a good person.

712
00:43:30,047 --> 00:43:31,966
What about me is good? I want details.

713
00:43:33,887 --> 00:43:35,736
Let's just say you're an average person.

714
00:43:37,956 --> 00:43:39,516
Mr. Average Person,

715
00:43:39,516 --> 00:43:42,207
will you continue to stay single?

716
00:43:42,987 --> 00:43:45,446
You seem like a pretty good guy.

717
00:43:46,797 --> 00:43:49,276
I wonder if you plan to stay single.

718
00:43:50,936 --> 00:43:52,187
I don't want to get excited.

719
00:43:54,237 --> 00:43:56,957
Depending on someone and being disappointed,

720
00:43:57,677 --> 00:44:00,657
hurt, and then liking them...

721
00:44:02,047 --> 00:44:04,126
I can't handle being excited in love anymore.

722
00:44:05,817 --> 00:44:09,566
If I fall after the age of 40, life won't be so kind.

723
00:44:11,087 --> 00:44:12,937
I want to live as I do now.

724
00:44:14,786 --> 00:44:16,276
Silently.

725
00:44:18,357 --> 00:44:19,546
Without any happenings.

726
00:44:39,447 --> 00:44:40,696
But...

727
00:44:44,087 --> 00:44:46,407
why do you want to be a mom?

728
00:44:48,626 --> 00:44:49,807
I just...

729
00:44:53,126 --> 00:44:55,276
want to become happy.

730
00:45:17,357 --> 00:45:20,807
You are very devoted to the company.

731
00:45:21,226 --> 00:45:23,977
You did some incredible PR for the magazine.

732
00:45:24,157 --> 00:45:27,577
I hear you turned the mom community upside down.

733
00:45:28,527 --> 00:45:30,436
She said she was investigating undercover,

734
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:33,036
so we should write an article saying that...

735
00:45:33,036 --> 00:45:34,356
to fix the situation.

736
00:45:34,806 --> 00:45:38,727
She told the readers that she wants to have a baby!

737
00:45:39,507 --> 00:45:41,306
- Yes, sir. - If we're going to play along,

738
00:45:41,306 --> 00:45:42,607
we need to get our stories straight.

739
00:45:42,607 --> 00:45:43,696
Yes, we do.

740
00:45:45,246 --> 00:45:47,987
- I'll do what I can to fix... - Stay out of it!

741
00:45:47,987 --> 00:45:49,146
Yes, sir.

742
00:45:49,146 --> 00:45:51,836
You have no kids, so you can't figure out the readers' needs.

743
00:45:52,016 --> 00:45:55,506
Even if you do well, I don't know about making you editor-in-chief.

744
00:45:55,757 --> 00:45:57,276
All you do is make trouble.

745
00:45:58,126 --> 00:46:00,276
That's why I plan to have a baby...

746
00:46:03,596 --> 00:46:07,287
I knew from the get-go that you were an imbecile,

747
00:46:07,737 --> 00:46:10,126
but I didn't know it was that bad.

748
00:46:11,376 --> 00:46:13,756
We're going to hold a disciplinary hearing.

749
00:46:14,677 --> 00:46:17,466
It's the first time in 30 years since we started,

750
00:46:17,576 --> 00:46:19,126
so it won't be easy.

751
00:46:19,817 --> 00:46:22,997
Given the situation, we will be very stern.

752
00:46:26,987 --> 00:46:28,077
I'm sorry.

753
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:31,046
It was wrong to tarnish the company's image.

754
00:46:31,257 --> 00:46:33,446
But strictly put, it's your personal life.

755
00:46:33,697 --> 00:46:36,617
It's not like they'll take care of your life. Those schmucks.

756
00:46:39,036 --> 00:46:40,086
Excuse me.

757
00:46:43,376 --> 00:46:44,426
Hello?

758
00:46:44,476 --> 00:46:46,126
Are you Lee Ok Ran's guardian?

759
00:46:46,177 --> 00:46:47,756
This is Big Hospital.

760
00:46:47,907 --> 00:46:50,396
Why aren't you coming. We can't discharge her without you.

761
00:46:51,416 --> 00:46:52,497
Excuse me?

762
00:46:59,686 --> 00:47:01,637
Lee Ok Ran's guardian.

763
00:47:02,186 --> 00:47:04,676
- Yes. - She's still sleeping.

764
00:47:04,726 --> 00:47:07,396
Wait here. We'll let you know when she's out.

765
00:47:07,396 --> 00:47:09,176
- Okay. Thank you. - Sure.

766
00:47:15,806 --> 00:47:17,626
Park Shi Ta's guardian.

767
00:47:35,186 --> 00:47:36,276
Okay.

768
00:47:38,226 --> 00:47:39,506
Hello.

769
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:41,096
I'm here for my baby's vaccination shot.

770
00:47:41,096 --> 00:47:42,726
Okay. Wait here.

771
00:47:42,726 --> 00:47:43,887
Okay.

772
00:47:44,436 --> 00:47:46,117
Ha Ri. Where are we?

773
00:47:46,536 --> 00:47:47,917
You're so sweet.

774
00:47:52,306 --> 00:47:54,227
It's a sad realization.

775
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:57,327
Sit here.

776
00:47:59,646 --> 00:48:00,786
Are you okay?

777
00:48:00,786 --> 00:48:02,497
It's okay.

778
00:48:02,947 --> 00:48:05,407
Even as I saw the growing wrinkles on Mom's face,

779
00:48:11,596 --> 00:48:14,017
I was indifferent and only counted my age.

780
00:48:20,107 --> 00:48:22,356
- Jang Ha Ri's guardian? - Yes, me. Me.

781
00:48:24,076 --> 00:48:26,657
Oh no. How did this happen?

782
00:48:26,706 --> 00:48:28,896
Oh no. You poor thing.

783
00:48:29,476 --> 00:48:31,097
Because a Mom is a Mom,

784
00:48:33,117 --> 00:48:35,437
I always expected to depend on her.

785
00:48:36,516 --> 00:48:37,767
Does it hurt?

786
00:48:44,027 --> 00:48:47,146
Why did I take it for granted that she was my guardian?

787
00:48:51,536 --> 00:48:53,687
- Lee Ok Ran's guardian. - Yes.

788
00:48:54,206 --> 00:48:55,486
- Okay. - Mom.

789
00:48:58,677 --> 00:48:59,727
- Thank you. - Goodbye.

790
00:49:01,076 --> 00:49:02,227
Are you okay?

791
00:49:02,746 --> 00:49:03,827
Yes.

792
00:49:07,117 --> 00:49:08,637
That moment always comes...

793
00:49:08,916 --> 00:49:12,006
when the child becomes their parent's guardian.

794
00:49:16,726 --> 00:49:17,946
At...

795
00:49:20,297 --> 00:49:21,417
that moment,

796
00:49:23,737 --> 00:49:25,747
we have no choice but to become adults.

797
00:49:48,456 --> 00:49:51,407
Did you two go somewhere nice?

798
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:52,907
Goodness.

799
00:50:03,107 --> 00:50:04,327
So...

800
00:50:04,637 --> 00:50:07,957
They let me go alone last time. That's why I went alone.

801
00:50:08,507 --> 00:50:10,526
I didn't know the hospital changed its policy.

802
00:50:10,976 --> 00:50:13,867
Why would you go to the hospital alone like you have no family?

803
00:50:15,416 --> 00:50:17,637
I'm the only one who didn't know you had stomach cancer.

804
00:50:18,087 --> 00:50:21,376
I get a call on the day of the surgery as if it's a picnic.

805
00:50:21,527 --> 00:50:22,606
How...

806
00:50:26,596 --> 00:50:28,577
You shouldn't do that to your daughter.

807
00:50:29,697 --> 00:50:31,646
Why are you making me a bad daughter?

808
00:50:32,496 --> 00:50:33,957
Did someone say you were bad?

809
00:50:34,206 --> 00:50:37,687
Everyone knows you work long hours and can't even come home.

810
00:50:39,107 --> 00:50:41,407
Don't mind me, and focus on your job.

811
00:50:41,407 --> 00:50:43,447
How can I not mind you when you're sick?

812
00:50:43,447 --> 00:50:46,126
I'm not sick. They said I'm fine.

813
00:50:46,447 --> 00:50:49,367
You should eat and sleep properly as you work.

814
00:50:51,987 --> 00:50:56,437
I... I'm always making you worry about me.

815
00:51:00,367 --> 00:51:02,046
Can't I worry about you too?

816
00:51:07,107 --> 00:51:10,227
Even if I act immature,

817
00:51:10,507 --> 00:51:14,126
I can take care of you, so have faith in your daughter.

818
00:51:18,317 --> 00:51:21,637
Why would you take care of me? I'm not terminally ill.

819
00:51:22,817 --> 00:51:25,566
Save your nagging for your kids.

820
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:28,826
Get sperm or whatever. Have kids using whatever means you want.

821
00:51:28,826 --> 00:51:30,106
It's so annoying.

822
00:51:32,456 --> 00:51:33,747
No, that's...

823
00:51:42,107 --> 00:51:44,356
I thought I could raise a baby well,

824
00:51:46,976 --> 00:51:49,526
but I didn't think about the child who'd have to live without a dad.

825
00:51:54,617 --> 00:51:55,867
I was being greedy.

826
00:52:00,527 --> 00:52:01,736
I mean,

827
00:52:02,357 --> 00:52:05,106
I was fine although I only had you, so...

828
00:52:13,436 --> 00:52:15,417
I thought I could do well.

829
00:52:18,107 --> 00:52:19,887
But I should've thought about the kid first.

830
00:52:23,646 --> 00:52:25,227
I don't think I'm qualified.

831
00:52:30,717 --> 00:52:32,066
Did someone say something?

832
00:52:32,317 --> 00:52:33,466
No.

833
00:52:35,956 --> 00:52:37,046
My gosh.

834
00:52:37,657 --> 00:52:40,176
Parents have kids because they want to.

835
00:52:41,297 --> 00:52:44,396
No baby is born out of their own will.

836
00:52:44,396 --> 00:52:48,187
Do you think I gave birth to you because you begged me to?

837
00:52:48,337 --> 00:52:50,256
What kind of nonsense are you talking about?

838
00:52:52,777 --> 00:52:54,907
You don't study and take tests to become a mother.

839
00:52:54,907 --> 00:52:56,926
You become a mother after you give birth.

840
00:52:57,547 --> 00:53:00,296
There's no license for that. Don't say you're not qualified.

841
00:53:02,047 --> 00:53:03,736
You're right. There's no license.

842
00:53:04,887 --> 00:53:08,006
But if there was a license test for that,

843
00:53:08,126 --> 00:53:09,126
you'd get the highest score.

844
00:53:09,126 --> 00:53:12,006
So be good to your mom.

845
00:53:12,257 --> 00:53:14,427
Anyway, I don't think this was a fight.

846
00:53:14,427 --> 00:53:17,946
It was really nice to watch you guys reconcile and make peace.

847
00:53:18,036 --> 00:53:21,316
Do Ah is crying. I'll leave you guys to wrap it up. I love you guys.

848
00:53:21,706 --> 00:53:22,856
Do Ah.

849
00:53:24,436 --> 00:53:26,126
What was that? My gosh.

850
00:53:58,036 --> 00:54:00,526
Aren't you going to drink? Let's have a drink.

851
00:54:00,777 --> 00:54:03,007
No, I don't want to become an alcoholic like you.

852
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:04,526
I'll sue you for slander.

853
00:54:04,677 --> 00:54:05,827
Don't do that.

854
00:54:06,677 --> 00:54:08,497
I'm sick of getting punished.

855
00:54:09,717 --> 00:54:11,207
Are you serious?

856
00:54:12,587 --> 00:54:13,876
What can you do?

857
00:54:13,927 --> 00:54:15,676
You're just going through...

858
00:54:15,987 --> 00:54:18,207
the adversities and hardships of becoming a mom.

859
00:54:21,826 --> 00:54:24,446
Come to think of it, even you didn't ask.

860
00:54:25,536 --> 00:54:26,586
What?

861
00:54:27,067 --> 00:54:30,657
No one asked me why, but I Sang did.

862
00:54:33,607 --> 00:54:35,526
He asked me why I want to become a mom.

863
00:54:38,516 --> 00:54:40,836
What other reason could there be?

864
00:54:41,646 --> 00:54:43,767
You want to become a mom because of your motherly instincts.

865
00:54:44,357 --> 00:54:47,937
Yes, you're right.

866
00:54:50,757 --> 00:54:54,747
But on my way home, I suddenly remembered...

867
00:54:56,697 --> 00:54:58,586
my elementary school graduation day.

868
00:55:02,936 --> 00:55:05,157
Don't be a scrooge and just get her a big bouquet.

869
00:55:05,206 --> 00:55:06,626
And take a lot of photos.

870
00:55:11,976 --> 00:55:14,466
Don't go anywhere else, okay? If you do, I'll get really angry.

871
00:55:15,047 --> 00:55:16,367
Okay.

872
00:55:24,297 --> 00:55:27,146
Dad, get me a big bouquet of roses.

873
00:55:27,266 --> 00:55:28,376
Okay.

874
00:55:32,596 --> 00:55:35,067
Ha Ri, I need to get a film...

875
00:55:35,067 --> 00:55:37,277
for the camera.

876
00:55:37,277 --> 00:55:38,387
You should go without me.

877
00:55:38,936 --> 00:55:41,057
- Do you know which class I'm in? - What?

878
00:55:41,376 --> 00:55:43,626
I'm in class 6-5. It's on the 4th floor.

879
00:55:44,146 --> 00:55:45,526
Can you find your way there?

880
00:55:45,846 --> 00:55:46,926
Of course.

881
00:55:47,447 --> 00:55:49,466
You go first. I'll be right there.

882
00:55:54,626 --> 00:55:55,807
Wait for me!

883
00:56:06,996 --> 00:56:10,407
(Ssanggang Elementary School, 23rd Graduation Ceremony)

884
00:56:10,407 --> 00:56:12,837
(Congratulations on your graduation)

885
00:56:12,837 --> 00:56:14,396
No matter how long I waited,

886
00:56:15,976 --> 00:56:17,597
my dad didn't show up.

887
00:56:18,516 --> 00:56:20,367
I was the only one standing there all by myself,

888
00:56:21,117 --> 00:56:24,307
and I was embarrassed because it felt like all eyes were on me.

889
00:56:26,117 --> 00:56:28,106
But I couldn't go home.

890
00:56:30,896 --> 00:56:34,077
Because I knew my dad won't ever come back.

891
00:56:38,137 --> 00:56:41,017
Ha Ri, what are you doing here?

892
00:56:41,206 --> 00:56:42,356
Where is your dad?

893
00:56:43,407 --> 00:56:44,486
I don't know.

894
00:56:51,476 --> 00:56:54,267
Ha Ri, let's take a photo together. Come here.

895
00:56:56,146 --> 00:56:57,257
Why?

896
00:56:57,257 --> 00:56:58,667
- Stand there. - You guys are friends.

897
00:56:59,217 --> 00:57:00,807
Smile.

898
00:57:00,826 --> 00:57:02,676
- 1, 2, 3. - 1, 2, 3.

899
00:57:04,326 --> 00:57:06,857
Let's take one more photo. Give me a bright smile.

900
00:57:06,857 --> 00:57:09,176
You look really ugly right now.

901
00:57:09,527 --> 00:57:10,586
Why you...

902
00:57:11,936 --> 00:57:13,917
- Oh, gosh! - No, wait!

903
00:57:14,266 --> 00:57:15,436
Ha Ri, stop.

904
00:57:15,436 --> 00:57:18,107
- What's the matter? - Stop it.

905
00:57:18,107 --> 00:57:19,935
- Stop it, Jae Young. - Ha Ri.

906
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:22,447
My goodness, what did you say?

907
00:57:22,447 --> 00:57:24,126
Jae Young, stop it.

908
00:57:27,846 --> 00:57:30,637
(Pig Skin)

909
00:57:33,887 --> 00:57:35,676
- Mom. - Oh, dear.

910
00:57:37,326 --> 00:57:38,407
Ha Ri, what's wrong?

911
00:57:38,956 --> 00:57:40,716
Mom!

912
00:57:40,766 --> 00:57:41,816
Where's your dad?

913
00:57:49,237 --> 00:57:50,316
Is it yummy?

914
00:57:51,036 --> 00:57:52,126
Yes.

915
00:57:54,876 --> 00:57:56,526
It's all over your mouth.

916
00:58:01,117 --> 00:58:02,566
You're okay without your dad, right?

917
00:58:07,956 --> 00:58:09,077
Yes.

918
00:58:11,996 --> 00:58:13,077
Eat some meat.

919
00:58:20,166 --> 00:58:22,586
That's when I promised myself to become an awesome person...

920
00:58:23,137 --> 00:58:24,756
when I grow up.

921
00:58:25,607 --> 00:58:27,497
What kind of an awesome person?

922
00:58:29,306 --> 00:58:30,396
A mom.

923
00:58:36,217 --> 00:58:39,037
My mom is the most awesome person in the world.

924
00:58:46,297 --> 00:58:47,446
A mother.

925
00:59:35,476 --> 00:59:37,727
They'll probably cut her wage for about 1 to 3 months.

926
00:59:39,777 --> 00:59:40,966
Do you think this is fun?

927
00:59:41,947 --> 00:59:43,236
No, I'm worried.

928
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:47,006
The worst thing that can happen to an employee is not getting paid.

929
00:59:47,857 --> 00:59:50,477
Did she really make such a big mistake?

930
00:59:51,596 --> 00:59:54,477
She tarnished the company's reputation and credibility.

931
00:59:56,427 --> 00:59:59,417
I should've just quietly dealt with those mothers.

932
01:00:07,407 --> 01:00:08,457
What happened?

933
01:00:10,876 --> 01:00:12,267
They suspended her for a month.

934
01:00:12,516 --> 01:00:13,597
- What? - What?

935
01:00:14,717 --> 01:00:17,396
Then she won't get paid for a month?

936
01:00:17,456 --> 01:00:19,317
This is unbelievable.

937
01:00:19,317 --> 01:00:21,137
They can't suspend her for this.

938
01:00:21,357 --> 01:00:23,407
How are we going to meet the deadline for our project?

939
01:00:24,056 --> 01:00:25,307
Where is Ha Ri?

940
01:00:27,867 --> 01:00:29,117
Hey, Ha Ri.

941
01:00:31,067 --> 01:00:32,787
I heard what happened.

942
01:00:33,396 --> 01:00:36,887
Hey... Ha Ri, I'll... I'll see you.

943
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:43,557
She got suspended for a month.

944
01:00:44,346 --> 01:00:45,997
She looks really angry, doesn't she?

945
01:01:11,806 --> 01:01:13,327
This game is for two people. You can't play it by yourself.

946
01:01:22,246 --> 01:01:23,836
Let's do this.

947
01:01:29,427 --> 01:01:30,637
Over there.

948
01:01:31,657 --> 01:01:33,176
To your left!

949
01:01:33,797 --> 01:01:35,297
This is hard.

950
01:01:35,297 --> 01:01:36,567
Shoot!

951
01:01:36,567 --> 01:01:38,787
You were supposed to shoot that.

952
01:01:39,396 --> 01:01:40,446
My gosh, no!

953
01:01:44,036 --> 01:01:45,126
(You Lose)

954
01:01:49,407 --> 01:01:51,597
You acted like a natural, so I thought you'd be a sniper.

955
01:01:53,246 --> 01:01:54,336
What next?

956
01:01:56,087 --> 01:01:59,006
Should we drink or go to the beach?

957
01:02:02,186 --> 01:02:04,347
I'm no longer stressed.

958
01:02:05,056 --> 01:02:06,376
I may have gotten suspended,

959
01:02:07,126 --> 01:02:08,347
but I still need to meet a deadline.

960
01:02:19,007 --> 01:02:21,026
This is fun, right?

961
01:02:21,376 --> 01:02:23,756
Let me see you smile!

962
01:02:23,976 --> 01:02:25,767
Over here! Look!

963
01:02:25,976 --> 01:02:27,796
Give me a smile.

964
01:02:28,016 --> 01:02:30,196
Smile, Yu Bin. Look here, Yu Bin.

965
01:02:30,286 --> 01:02:31,407
Over here!

966
01:02:32,357 --> 01:02:33,857
Yu Bin, give me a smile! He's laughing too!

967
01:02:33,857 --> 01:02:35,736
Look! He's laughing too!

968
01:02:42,266 --> 01:02:44,117
Yes, let's laugh!

969
01:02:46,867 --> 01:02:49,356
There you go. All right.

970
01:02:51,737 --> 01:02:53,756
I need him to cry this time.

971
01:02:54,846 --> 01:02:55,957
What do I do?

972
01:02:56,907 --> 01:02:59,597
Yoo Bin, roar.

973
01:02:59,846 --> 01:03:01,597
Roar! I'm coming to get you.

974
01:03:03,246 --> 01:03:04,867
He is a very bad man.

975
01:03:04,887 --> 01:03:06,887
Look at me hit the bad man.

976
01:03:06,887 --> 01:03:08,236
How nasty!

977
01:03:10,726 --> 01:03:11,946
You naughty boy.

978
01:03:17,396 --> 01:03:18,517
You naughty boy!

979
01:03:24,476 --> 01:03:26,157
As if you stood a chance.

980
01:03:26,306 --> 01:03:27,626
That's what I call talent.

981
01:03:34,416 --> 01:03:36,637
- Can you check the photos? - Sure.

982
01:03:41,357 --> 01:03:42,676
Let's see.

983
01:03:45,197 --> 01:03:46,876
That one.

984
01:03:49,626 --> 01:03:50,946
They're all good.

985
01:03:51,096 --> 01:03:52,387
This should be the main photo.

986
01:03:53,266 --> 01:03:55,517
Mr. Han,

987
01:03:56,637 --> 01:03:57,827
I'm impressed.

988
01:04:05,876 --> 01:04:08,796
(Good job!)

989
01:04:12,717 --> 01:04:15,807
It's us grown-ups who really need compliments.

990
01:04:20,157 --> 01:04:21,446
Good job, Mr. Han.

991
01:04:22,797 --> 01:04:25,887
- Ha Ri, the baby's mom is leaving. - Okay.

992
01:04:27,396 --> 01:04:28,407
Goodbye.

993
01:04:28,407 --> 01:04:35,256
(Good job!)

994
01:05:10,777 --> 01:05:11,997
This is bad.

995
01:05:15,547 --> 01:05:20,966
(Good job!)

996
01:05:47,146 --> 01:05:49,767
(We thank Jang Gwang for his cameo appearance.)

997
01:06:08,067 --> 01:06:10,836
(Oh My Baby)

998
01:06:10,836 --> 01:06:12,427
You two were married?

999
01:06:12,737 --> 01:06:13,877
A second marriage?

1000
01:06:13,877 --> 01:06:15,696
Right, the sperm donation.

1001
01:06:15,976 --> 01:06:19,167
I wouldn't have to be a father to your baby,

1002
01:06:19,476 --> 01:06:21,447
- so I'll do you a favor. - Really?

1003
01:06:21,447 --> 01:06:22,747
She's staying the night out?

1004
01:06:22,747 --> 01:06:24,266
Isn't she alone with Mr. Han?

1005
01:06:24,817 --> 01:06:28,686
You found the one place that only has one inn.

1006
01:06:28,686 --> 01:06:31,037
She'll get an earful from me once she gets back.

1007
01:06:31,096 --> 01:06:33,907
Is he the one that I shouldn't have let go of?

1008
01:06:34,197 --> 01:06:35,476
How should...

1009
01:06:37,527 --> 01:06:38,986
we spend the night?
