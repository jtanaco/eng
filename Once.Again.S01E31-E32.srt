1
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:11,589
Get away from me.

2
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:14,065
- Honey, hold still.
- Get lost.

3
00:00:14,089 --> 00:00:15,859
You can't sleep with your socks on.

4
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,000
Gosh, my tailbone.

5
00:00:19,669 --> 00:00:23,539
I can't believe I was
kicked by my own wife.

6
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:26,070
It hurts.

7
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:27,570
Does it hurt?

8
00:00:29,109 --> 00:00:30,609
Well, I'm hurting too.

9
00:00:32,179 --> 00:00:33,179
It...

10
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,519
It hurts right here.

11
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,025
- Honey, hold on.
- Yes?

12
00:00:41,049 --> 00:00:43,189
- Hold on a second.
- What is it?

13
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,159
Let's...

14
00:00:45,689 --> 00:00:46,729
move...

15
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,899
to a foreign country.

16
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,700
Let's leave the kids behind...

17
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,100
and move to another country.

18
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,015
Sure, let's do just that.

19
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,179
We will,
but I'm exhausted right now.

20
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:04,710
So go to sleep for now.
Get some sleep.

21
00:01:05,609 --> 00:01:07,585
Darn you.

22
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:11,049
Darn this!

23
00:01:13,219 --> 00:01:15,159
Goodness.

24
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:18,159
Get some sleep.

25
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:21,700
Gosh, it hurts.

26
00:01:23,129 --> 00:01:24,400
Unbelievable.

27
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:14,250
Gyu Jin,
I'm in the middle of a crisis.

28
00:02:15,579 --> 00:02:17,150
I think I made a huge mistake.

29
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:19,289
Mom wants me to go on blind dates.

30
00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:20,865
Either that
or I'm supposed to return home.

31
00:02:20,889 --> 00:02:22,659
What should I do?

32
00:02:22,689 --> 00:02:25,365
It's like deciding whether
to burn to death or drown.

33
00:02:25,389 --> 00:02:28,530
Na Hee's temper makes it
easier for her to get indigestion.

34
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:32,075
All she needs to do though is
take some medicine and sleep it off,

35
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:34,075
but Jeong Rok was rubbing her hand.

36
00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:36,000
It annoyed me so much...

37
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,816
that I stuck my nose in
where it doesn't belong.

38
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,885
An arranged marriage
in this day and age?

39
00:02:40,909 --> 00:02:42,385
All we would do is try to dig up
information on the other's family...

40
00:02:42,409 --> 00:02:43,740
and flash fake smiles.

41
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:47,126
These so-called blind dates
couldn't be more archaic.

42
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:49,996
Someone with indigestion
should be given medicine...

43
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,226
or sent home.

44
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:54,620
Why was he hovering
over her like that?

45
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,990
Gyu Jin, must you be this way?

46
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,105
Don't you care about my life at all?

47
00:03:00,129 --> 00:03:01,300
As if you cared about mine.

48
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:02,876
And besides,
I'm in enough trouble myself.

49
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:06,006
But this is different.
I'm in this mess because of you.

50
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:08,645
Mom's being this way
because you failed.

51
00:03:08,669 --> 00:03:10,346
You're to be blamed for this too.

52
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:12,746
It's why I'm letting you live here.

53
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:14,045
What more do you want?

54
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:17,639
I don't know. What do I do?

55
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,150
A blind date?

56
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,295
I can't believe
I acted the way I did.

57
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:25,226
Do I have to apologize for this?

58
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,449
Unbelievable!

59
00:03:37,129 --> 00:03:39,229
Mom, what are you doing out here?

60
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:40,710
I was going
to set the table for you.

61
00:03:41,229 --> 00:03:42,439
It's fine.

62
00:03:42,969 --> 00:03:45,870
I'm feeling too queasy
to lie down anyway.

63
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,509
Did you make it from scratch?

64
00:03:48,909 --> 00:03:51,379
Yes, it's your famous
hangover bean sprout soup.

65
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:53,955
Actually, Da Hee made it
and I just seasoned it for her.

66
00:03:53,979 --> 00:03:56,295
- Would you like some?
- Maybe later.

67
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:01,189
I drank so much last night
and now I have a killer headache.

68
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,289
We all have one of those days.

69
00:04:03,689 --> 00:04:05,409
I bet it relieved
some of the stress though.

70
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,930
Maybe next time,
you can join me for a drink.

71
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,436
I'm a much better drinking buddy.

72
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:12,830
Save it.
I'm never going to drink again.

73
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:19,409
Na Hee won't have breakfast.
She has indigestion from yesterday.

74
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:20,710
Really?

75
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,509
No wonder her face was pale.

76
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,709
What happened though?

77
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,550
I know this is hard for you, Mom,

78
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:35,319
but it's taking a toll
on Na Hee too.

79
00:04:35,689 --> 00:04:37,769
She has indigestion
even though she doesn't eat much.

80
00:04:38,189 --> 00:04:40,336
So if you could
take it easy on her...

81
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,276
What do you mean?
What on earth did I do anyway?

82
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,245
It's not like
I've been yelling at her.

83
00:04:45,269 --> 00:04:48,540
Fine, Mom.
I won't say anything more. Sorry.

84
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,110
Da Hee, can you set the table?
I'll call down the guys upstairs.

85
00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:54,540
Breakfast is ready!

86
00:05:03,379 --> 00:05:06,589
Doing cardio on an empty stomach
is the best way to lose fat.

87
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:10,220
The director wants lean muscles like
Bruce Lee, so what else can we do?

88
00:05:10,389 --> 00:05:11,829
We need to meet his criteria.

89
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:14,389
- Sure thing.
- This is nothing, Joon Seon.

90
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:19,399
Why is it so hard
to get into shape though?

91
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:21,110
Maybe I've been
eating too much these days.

92
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:28,040
Hey, you're quite fit.

93
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,456
I can tell you've been working out
for a while.

94
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,610
Are you an athlete?

95
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:34,879
- No.
- Don't be ridiculous.

96
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:37,855
He only built muscles
to look good for the girls.

97
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:41,120
Isn't it obvious?
This isn't just for show.

98
00:05:41,459 --> 00:05:45,305
Check out his body.
I bet he's some sort of athlete.

99
00:05:45,329 --> 00:05:46,665
Look at his tight butt.

100
00:05:46,689 --> 00:05:48,660
Guys, breakfast is ready.

101
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:51,699
My gosh.

102
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:54,245
You're in the middle
of your morning workout.

103
00:05:54,269 --> 00:05:55,646
Good morning, Ga Hee.

104
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:56,839
Good morning.

105
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:59,870
Sure. Come down for breakfast, guys.

106
00:06:00,069 --> 00:06:01,656
The table is set.

107
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,410
But we need to manage our weight.

108
00:06:03,509 --> 00:06:05,925
Guys, stick mainly to vegetables...

109
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:07,055
and eat only half a bowl of rice.

110
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:09,125
Got it, Joon Seon.
I'll only eat half.

111
00:06:09,149 --> 00:06:10,495
Sure, just half a bowl.

112
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:12,565
Instead of walking,
jog on the spot as you take steps.

113
00:06:12,589 --> 00:06:17,196
- 1, 2, 1, 2...
- 1, 2, 1, 2.

114
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,589
- 1, 2, 1, 2.
- Drama queens.

115
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:22,930
- Hyo Sin, you should also...
- Sure.

116
00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:32,709
His looks couldn't be more my type,
but his attitude is far from it.

117
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,339
Too bad.

118
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,295
Good morning.

119
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:50,360
Yes, good morning.

120
00:06:55,699 --> 00:06:57,259
I'm sorry about yesterday.

121
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,800
What for?

122
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:03,670
I thought about it at home...

123
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:07,509
and it could seem
like I was on edge.

124
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:11,850
Anyway, I sometimes cross the line
when I'm inebriated.

125
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:14,855
Although I didn't drink
that much yesterday.

126
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:16,656
Maybe my tolerance for alcohol
has gotten weaker.

127
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,680
Really?

128
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,519
Is that it?

129
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,089
Sorry?

130
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,800
You acted that way
because you were drunk?

131
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,860
That's it?

132
00:07:29,129 --> 00:07:31,129
What other reason would I have?

133
00:07:32,269 --> 00:07:33,470
I'm just asking.

134
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,870
I wanted to be sure.

135
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:41,740
I forgot about what happened anyway,
so don't worry.

136
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:43,439
Have a good day.

137
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:52,550
It wasn't this bad
when Joon Seon was around,

138
00:07:53,449 --> 00:07:56,019
but now I feel like
the only moocher.

139
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:00,959
Should I do something too?

140
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,029
Hi, Ji Soo.

141
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:09,269
What are you doing this evening?

142
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:13,069
What else? I'll probably be home.
Why do you ask?

143
00:08:13,509 --> 00:08:16,279
Hye Soo got promoted,

144
00:08:16,339 --> 00:08:18,509
so she's buying.
You're welcome to join us.

145
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:22,050
Really? That's great news.
Of course I'll...

146
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:26,649
Wait. Don't tell me
that Yoon Mi will be there.

147
00:08:26,949 --> 00:08:29,396
Of course not.
We won't tell a fly this time.

148
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,819
You don't have to worry.

149
00:08:31,389 --> 00:08:33,860
Sure then. Yes, I know the place.

150
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:36,199
I'll see you later.

151
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:39,569
Nice! I'm going out.

152
00:08:40,899 --> 00:08:41,899
Hold on.

153
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,669
I sold all my purses though.

154
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,139
What am I supposed to wear?

155
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,419
Coming in.

156
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,159
Let's see.

157
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:06,960
Gosh, she has some nice stuff.

158
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:10,559
My goodness. Leave it to her
to always be meticulous.

159
00:09:11,769 --> 00:09:14,100
Thanks, Na Hee.
I'll enjoy wearing these.

160
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:18,100
Gosh, these are so pretty.

161
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:19,639
Wait.

162
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,779
My gosh.

163
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,186
Darn it. What now?

164
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:31,250
Did you tell the teacher
that we were bullying you?

165
00:09:31,789 --> 00:09:32,766
It wasn't me.

166
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,566
Don't think about lying.
We know it was you.

167
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:36,659
I'm not the only one
you've been bullying,

168
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,759
so check again. It wasn't me.

169
00:09:41,389 --> 00:09:43,429
- Darn it.
- What are you looking at, loser?

170
00:09:43,659 --> 00:09:46,100
You live with your mom
at your grandpa's house.

171
00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:48,745
It's because your parents
are divorced.

172
00:09:48,769 --> 00:09:51,370
I can't believe
you're living off her parents.

173
00:09:51,539 --> 00:09:52,570
You jerk!

174
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:54,139
Darn it.

175
00:09:57,779 --> 00:09:58,850
Hey!

176
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,480
You...

177
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:02,679
You jerk!

178
00:10:05,289 --> 00:10:06,320
Stop...

179
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:13,059
I don't want to interfere
with your business,

180
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:16,129
but it's 6 p.m. already.

181
00:10:17,029 --> 00:10:18,059
Do you know that?

182
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:21,245
Isn't the date at 6 p.m.?
Did you cancel it?

183
00:10:21,269 --> 00:10:22,700
No, I'm going.

184
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:24,115
But?

185
00:10:24,139 --> 00:10:25,840
I'm being late on purpose.

186
00:10:26,009 --> 00:10:30,080
Come to think of it,
I just have to be dumped.

187
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:32,279
There's nothing
Mom can do about that.

188
00:10:33,009 --> 00:10:35,726
I worried over something
that had an easy solution.

189
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:38,426
Just go out there
and ask for her understanding.

190
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:40,450
This is rude, you know.

191
00:10:40,889 --> 00:10:42,966
That's rich coming from a person...

192
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:46,289
who got temperamental
with Jeong Rok for no reason.

193
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,306
I wonder which will hurt the most.

194
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:52,929
Hey, it was just a joke.

195
00:10:53,629 --> 00:10:54,700
Put them down.

196
00:10:55,299 --> 00:10:56,740
Gyu Jin, look at me.

197
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,809
Which side of my face looks better?

198
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:01,009
I don't like them both.

199
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:03,056
The left one? I knew it.

200
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,710
If she wants to slap me,
I should stick out my right cheek.

201
00:11:05,779 --> 00:11:06,909
Okay.

202
00:11:07,309 --> 00:11:08,480
I'm ready.

203
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,279
I'll off to get slapped then.
See you at home.

204
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:17,090
What a dork.

205
00:11:27,769 --> 00:11:29,409
You acted that way
because you were drunk?

206
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,370
That's it?

207
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:32,809
Sorry?

208
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:34,639
I'm just asking.

209
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,080
I wanted to be sure.

210
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,309
Welcome.

211
00:12:08,509 --> 00:12:10,080
Can beginners join this class?

212
00:12:10,509 --> 00:12:12,309
I'm all fingers and thumbs though.

213
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,110
Sure. Please come on in.

214
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,669
You're home late.

215
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,399
Yes.

216
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:40,009
You fell down again, didn't you?

217
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:43,440
Do you want some ice cream?

218
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:50,919
It's good, isn't it?

219
00:12:52,289 --> 00:12:54,490
Not really.
I don't like this ice cream.

220
00:12:54,889 --> 00:12:56,919
This was the only
"buy 1, get 1 free" deal.

221
00:12:57,759 --> 00:12:59,360
That's why I'm just eating it.

222
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:09,676
I guess you've
been falling quite often.

223
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,500
Don't you think you're too weak?

224
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,139
Mom says I was born weak.

225
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:19,879
But that's something you can
overcome with acquired strength.

226
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:25,289
Do you want to play a sport?

227
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:39,799
How is it? Does it fit?

228
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:43,070
It's a little too big for you.

229
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:47,870
The length fits you,
but you're too skinny.

230
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,379
Come here.

231
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,519
That's better.

232
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:02,559
Can I exercise here?

233
00:14:02,659 --> 00:14:05,490
Yes. My friend runs this place,
so it's okay.

234
00:14:06,059 --> 00:14:08,299
What do you say to working out
for an hour every evening?

235
00:14:08,899 --> 00:14:09,960
Okay.

236
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,200
Keep it a secret from my mom though.

237
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:16,100
If she finds out,
she will just worry.

238
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,500
Okay. I won't tell her.

239
00:14:19,309 --> 00:14:20,440
Are you ready?

240
00:14:21,009 --> 00:14:22,179
Shall we begin?

241
00:14:23,379 --> 00:14:24,440
Okay.

242
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,919
You said you're ready.

243
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:34,690
You're not supposed to let
your guard down when you're here.

244
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:37,320
You never know
when I'll throw you down,

245
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,730
so keep your guard up.

246
00:14:39,929 --> 00:14:43,029
The goal is
for you to throw me down.

247
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,830
Got it?

248
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:48,500
Yes, I got it.

249
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:52,340
Let's go.
We should stretch out first.

250
00:15:07,889 --> 00:15:09,059
Ms. Seo Yun Hee?

251
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:13,730
I'm sorry.
Have you been waiting for long?

252
00:15:14,659 --> 00:15:17,700
Well, I can't exactly say no.

253
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,269
I guess the traffic was bad.

254
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:23,500
No. The traffic was fine.

255
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,785
Actually, I forgot about this.

256
00:15:25,809 --> 00:15:27,309
I drank a lot last night.

257
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:31,110
Am I being too honest
when we just met?

258
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:35,580
No. I like honest people.

259
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:37,549
I just hate pretense.

260
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:42,519
Shall we order something to eat?

261
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:52,806
It was my dad who made me
go to Harvard.

262
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:55,669
It was actually nice.
I became more open-minded.

263
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:57,799
I see.

264
00:15:58,669 --> 00:15:59,740
All right.

265
00:16:04,509 --> 00:16:06,179
And that's why I came here today.

266
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:08,750
My dad always makes
the right choices.

267
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:10,419
Okay.

268
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:18,019
I want things to go well between us.

269
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:20,330
How about you?

270
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,529
You're very straightforward.

271
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:30,799
Now that you said it,
I should be honest with you.

272
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:33,916
I came here
because my mom forced me.

273
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,716
I'm a non-believer
when it comes to marriage.

274
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:38,779
I'm not even interested in
these kinds of meetings or marriage.

275
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:40,809
But I am.

276
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:44,850
I've never seen a guy
who's so indifferent to me before.

277
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:48,190
So it makes me want
to get to know you better.

278
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,320
Well...

279
00:16:53,059 --> 00:16:56,700
Actually, I have a girlfriend.

280
00:16:57,299 --> 00:16:58,299
You do?

281
00:16:58,629 --> 00:17:00,149
You said
you don't believe in marriage.

282
00:17:01,899 --> 00:17:04,546
But she is the one who made me
change my beliefs.

283
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:06,210
I promised to marry her.

284
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:09,115
I couldn't tell my mom about her yet
because of certain reasons.

285
00:17:09,139 --> 00:17:11,139
But if she finds out
that I'm on a date with you,

286
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,109
she will be so upset.

287
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,880
When I think of her,

288
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:16,750
my heart aches.

289
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:19,319
I think this is true love.

290
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:22,259
Then let me see her.

291
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:25,420
- See what?
- Your girlfriend.

292
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:29,029
I think that's the only way
I can give up on you.

293
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,075
No, it's...

294
00:17:31,099 --> 00:17:32,275
This is on me.

295
00:17:32,299 --> 00:17:33,730
You pay next time.

296
00:17:33,869 --> 00:17:36,876
Well... Wait. Yu Mi.

297
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,500
I mean, Yun Hee.

298
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:40,339
Ms. Seo Yun Hee.

299
00:17:40,869 --> 00:17:42,069
Ms. Seo Yun Hee!

300
00:17:43,809 --> 00:17:46,950
I have two quick turn flights
in this month's schedule.

301
00:17:47,049 --> 00:17:48,325
Me too.

302
00:17:48,349 --> 00:17:50,579
I have one layover flight in Paris.

303
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:52,890
That's the only comfort I have.

304
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,420
When are we ever going to
become service directors?

305
00:17:55,589 --> 00:17:57,196
Hye Soo, is it nice to become
a senior service director?

306
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:00,259
The money and welfare are
even better than I thought.

307
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:03,436
You guys should work hard
to earn points for promotion.

308
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:05,160
Don't even think about taking leave.

309
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,299
It's all over
once your career is stalled.

310
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:14,015
Excuse me.
Can I get some water please?

311
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:15,069
Okay.

312
00:18:15,579 --> 00:18:17,585
I'm sorry
we kept talking about work.

313
00:18:17,609 --> 00:18:19,009
It's okay.

314
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,380
It's nice to hear it after a while.
It reminds me of the old days.

315
00:18:22,849 --> 00:18:25,825
By the way, why didn't Gyu Ri come?
Is she working?

316
00:18:25,849 --> 00:18:26,926
As soon as she got promoted,

317
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:28,690
she got scouted
by a foreign airline.

318
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:30,966
She got a house and a car
from the company.

319
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:34,430
I checked her social media.
She travels a lot on her off days.

320
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:36,460
She's in Spain now.

321
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,906
Really?

322
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:40,106
All my colleagues are successful.

323
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:41,430
I'm so proud of you guys.

324
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:44,616
Oh, right. Yeon Hee is
looking for an instructor...

325
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,646
at her flight attendant academy.

326
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:48,240
Do you know anyone
you can recommend?

327
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,910
I heard the pay is pretty good.

328
00:18:51,609 --> 00:18:52,849
I don't know.

329
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:55,380
I can't think of anyone.

330
00:18:56,119 --> 00:18:58,680
Hey, me. I can do it.

331
00:18:58,779 --> 00:19:01,190
That's my area of expertise.

332
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:04,589
You guys know that I got top scores
during my interview.

333
00:19:04,819 --> 00:19:08,930
But the thing is they look at
your career background.

334
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,040
You haven't been working
for quite a long time.

335
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,640
I see.

336
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:21,339
That's understandable. I get it.

337
00:19:22,069 --> 00:19:23,809
I hope you're not offended.

338
00:19:24,339 --> 00:19:26,579
Of course not.
Why would I be offended?

339
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,049
I just wanted to try it
to pass the time.

340
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,956
If I really were to do it,
I'll have to prepare a lot.

341
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,890
I can't bother with all that.
I won't do it. I take that back.

342
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,210
Those girls have no regard...

343
00:20:03,349 --> 00:20:06,150
for the feelings of others.

344
00:20:06,849 --> 00:20:08,549
Those nasty wenches.

345
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,220
Do you think
you guys will work forever...

346
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:15,089
with no breaks in your career?

347
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:17,900
You never know
what will happen in life.

348
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:23,900
They used to crawl before me
back in the day.

349
00:20:25,269 --> 00:20:27,149
So now you're just getting prettier?
Is that it?

350
00:20:40,819 --> 00:20:42,595
What do you think? Is it going well?

351
00:20:42,619 --> 00:20:45,190
Yes. It's fun.

352
00:20:45,859 --> 00:20:48,666
As you said, I don't get
any distracting thoughts,

353
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:49,859
which is even better.

354
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,000
I did it.

355
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,269
Do you want some coffee?

356
00:20:53,799 --> 00:20:54,829
Sounds good.

357
00:20:58,569 --> 00:21:00,386
What color is this anyway?

358
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:02,356
I'm doing as you said,

359
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:04,640
but I have no idea
what this color's called.

360
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,509
Giraffe poop.

361
00:21:08,509 --> 00:21:10,880
Its real name is evening shadow,

362
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,720
but Si Hoo calls it giraffe poop.

363
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:15,319
That's what everyone here calls it.

364
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:19,390
It really is that color.
Si Hoo is quite observant.

365
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:20,730
Isn't he?

366
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:23,960
The color grows on you
and doesn't even tarnish.

367
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:26,400
Just like you, giraffe poop.

368
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:29,745
Wait, what are you saying?

369
00:21:29,769 --> 00:21:31,129
Is that a compliment or an insult?

370
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:34,839
Mom.

371
00:21:35,569 --> 00:21:36,579
Si Hoo.

372
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,656
Dr. Yoon.

373
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,980
You look even cooler
in your uniform.

374
00:21:42,109 --> 00:21:43,319
Why are you here?

375
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:45,926
Do you live with us now?

376
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:48,650
No, Si Hoo, he's just visiting.

377
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,529
I don't think I can live with you.

378
00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:55,630
How about I show you around Seoul?

379
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:58,106
Let's go. Let's look around Seoul.

380
00:21:58,130 --> 00:21:59,505
- I'm scared.
- You can see Seoul from there.

381
00:21:59,529 --> 00:22:01,730
- Mom!
- Look around.

382
00:22:03,269 --> 00:22:04,345
Go ahead.

383
00:22:04,369 --> 00:22:06,539
Massage your arms
and legs before bed.

384
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:07,710
I will, Hyo Sin.

385
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,180
Can I call you by your name?

386
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:12,980
You already did.

387
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,680
Get some rest.

388
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:32,700
Hyo Sin.

389
00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:35,876
You just got back? You're late.

390
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,740
Yes. Did you have a drink?

391
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:41,009
Oh, my. Does it show?

392
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,980
Gosh. That's not good.

393
00:22:44,579 --> 00:22:47,480
If Mom and Dad notice,
they'll chew me out.

394
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,549
Do I stink?

395
00:22:56,289 --> 00:22:59,059
Oh, no.
I think even my clothes smell.

396
00:22:59,589 --> 00:23:01,329
What should I do?

397
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:04,099
Na Hee will nag me as well.

398
00:23:05,529 --> 00:23:06,529
This won't do.

399
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,980
What's that look about?

400
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:23,720
"What a pathetic woman."

401
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:26,420
That's what you're thinking.

402
00:23:26,549 --> 00:23:27,950
I can't exactly say no.

403
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:29,967
What?

404
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:32,660
I guess not all older people
are mature.

405
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:34,660
Bye.

406
00:23:39,569 --> 00:23:41,170
How dare he?

407
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:45,339
I liked him because he's cute.

408
00:23:47,369 --> 00:23:49,740
Is everyone being nasty
to me today or what?

409
00:23:50,809 --> 00:23:51,839
Darn it.

410
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,250
That...

411
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:57,450
You have no idea how scary I am.

412
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,890
You're dead meat.

413
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:03,019
You're so dead!

414
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:14,299
Are you leaving now?

415
00:24:14,869 --> 00:24:16,716
Yes, I had a lot to learn.

416
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:17,740
You?

417
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:20,269
I read a few papers.

418
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:28,480
I'll give you a lift. It's late.

419
00:24:31,019 --> 00:24:32,926
No, it's fine.

420
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:35,490
My ankle is fine today.

421
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:39,190
Let me drive you.

422
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:41,565
Consider it staff welfare.

423
00:24:41,589 --> 00:24:44,099
You worked hard
until this late hour.

424
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,410
There's so much to
running a hospital.

425
00:24:54,869 --> 00:24:58,210
Sitting at my desk all day
doing nothing...

426
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,750
makes me think I'd rather
work full-time doing surgeries.

427
00:25:03,849 --> 00:25:06,150
You loved surgery.

428
00:25:06,619 --> 00:25:07,650
I did.

429
00:25:08,789 --> 00:25:11,619
What papers
were you reading this late?

430
00:25:14,089 --> 00:25:17,299
Was it because
you didn't want to go home?

431
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:20,470
You got me.

432
00:25:22,299 --> 00:25:25,740
If it's that bad,
wouldn't you rather move out?

433
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:28,269
It's too uncomfortable for
you and your mother.

434
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,309
Tell me if you want to move out.

435
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,755
My sister plans to spend
a year in Fairfax...

436
00:25:38,779 --> 00:25:40,499
and a year in Korea
for her kid's education.

437
00:25:41,019 --> 00:25:43,660
She's looking for someone to
watch her place while she's away.

438
00:25:44,259 --> 00:25:46,089
It would be perfect if you move in.

439
00:25:47,289 --> 00:25:49,029
That's a bit...

440
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:52,000
It's fine. It's better than
hiring a stranger.

441
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:54,845
It's near my place,

442
00:25:54,869 --> 00:25:56,940
so we can carpool to and from work.

443
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:01,640
Thanks for the offer,
but I'll bear with it a bit longer.

444
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:03,980
If I move out now,

445
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:07,410
it'll take way too long
to reconcile with my mom.

446
00:26:12,519 --> 00:26:14,920
You can drop me off over there.

447
00:26:15,349 --> 00:26:16,390
Okay.

448
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:29,206
Thank you, Director Lee.
Your staff welfare is the best.

449
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:31,440
Not at all. You're my best employee.

450
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:34,045
I could take you to your front door.

451
00:26:34,069 --> 00:26:36,940
No, I appreciate the lift
this far. Goodbye.

452
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:38,410
Okay. See you tomorrow.

453
00:26:52,019 --> 00:26:53,559
Are you just coming home from work?

454
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:56,529
Yes. Our meeting ran late.

455
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,059
Who was that?

456
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,946
A senior from medical school.

457
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:02,740
He's our interim director.

458
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:05,815
It must be nice to have
a senior as your director.

459
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:07,339
He even drove you home.

460
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:16,450
Let's go on inside.

461
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:25,119
You just got back?

462
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:28,005
It's quite late considering you only
went to get slapped in the face.

463
00:27:28,029 --> 00:27:30,500
Gosh. Don't even ask.

464
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,706
You're pouting,
so I guess it didn't go your way.

465
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:35,970
Your cheek looks fine too.

466
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,446
Gyu Jin. The woman is so resilient.

467
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:41,716
I glanced around
to make her ditch me,

468
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:44,579
but she said I'm the first man
to act indifferent to her like that.

469
00:27:45,309 --> 00:27:47,585
She's curious about me.
She wants to date me.

470
00:27:47,609 --> 00:27:49,980
I was so flabbergasted.

471
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:55,890
Are you free on Saturday?

472
00:27:56,359 --> 00:27:58,089
I'll invite you to my gallery.

473
00:27:58,289 --> 00:27:59,660
Darn it.

474
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:02,089
What's wrong?

475
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:05,775
Hey, she's really into you.

476
00:28:05,799 --> 00:28:07,575
It's rare for a woman to do this.

477
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:08,769
What else did she say?

478
00:28:09,369 --> 00:28:12,140
"I won't accept excuses.
I'll wait until you come."

479
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:14,940
Hey, she's so cool.

480
00:28:15,009 --> 00:28:16,856
I don't like women like this.

481
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,156
She's more like Mom than Na Hee.

482
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:22,210
I'm so scared of women like that.

483
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:25,049
How can I get rid of her?

484
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,349
I said I have a girlfriend,
but she didn't believe me.

485
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:29,660
Then visit with a fake girlfriend.

486
00:28:29,789 --> 00:28:32,259
Are you kidding me? Who can I ask...

487
00:28:38,099 --> 00:28:39,769
- What are you doing?
- Don't talk.

488
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:42,599
I'm recruiting a fake girlfriend.

489
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,609
Ms. Song! I mean... Ex-in-law!

490
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:53,809
Over here. I'm over here.

491
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:56,779
- Hi.
- Don't run. You'll trip.

492
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:01,495
Am I late? I'm sorry.
Did I make you wait?

493
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:03,059
You're studying for an exam.

494
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:05,819
I feel bad for disturbing you.

495
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:08,835
You didn't. The district library
closes at 10 p.m.,

496
00:29:08,859 --> 00:29:10,359
so I was just about to leave.

497
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,606
Why did you call me out so late?

498
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:14,376
Is Gyu Jin in trouble?

499
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,700
No. Gyu Jin is doing
annoyingly well.

500
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:21,545
I need to ask you for a favor.

501
00:29:21,569 --> 00:29:23,640
You do? What is it?

502
00:29:24,109 --> 00:29:25,380
Be my girlfriend.

503
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,626
What?

504
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:28,886
No, I mean, not for real.

505
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:32,279
I'm in this situation
where I need a fake girlfriend.

506
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:35,190
You're the only person
I could ask for help.

507
00:29:37,059 --> 00:29:39,289
Oh, right. My goodness.

508
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:44,859
Your reaction kind of hurt.

509
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,400
Why were you so horrified?
Enough to back away from me.

510
00:29:49,299 --> 00:29:52,069
No, I mean, you know.

511
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,970
Our relationship is
a bit complicated.

512
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,585
I guess. If we were to date,
the number of people who'd faint...

513
00:29:59,609 --> 00:30:02,609
1, 2...
There would be at least 4, right?

514
00:30:03,779 --> 00:30:06,696
Why do you need a fake girlfriend?

515
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,720
It's a long story.

516
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:13,666
Because of Gyu Jin,
Mom wants to handpick a wife for me,

517
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:15,466
and I went on a blind date.

518
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:18,359
But the woman is a bit persistent.

519
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:20,106
She won't give up easily.

520
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:23,369
I said I have a girlfriend
I've been seeing for three years.

521
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,716
And you want me to
pretend to be that girlfriend?

522
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,186
- Yes.
- Gosh. I can't.

523
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:30,015
I can never do that.

524
00:30:30,039 --> 00:30:32,085
Just this once. Please.

525
00:30:32,109 --> 00:30:34,825
Don't you remember you owe me?

526
00:30:34,849 --> 00:30:38,180
For slamming the cafe door
on my foot and hurting it.

527
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:40,990
You teased me and we called it even!

528
00:30:42,619 --> 00:30:47,230
Do you always have to be so exact?

529
00:30:47,329 --> 00:30:49,529
Just give and take? That's cold.

530
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:51,706
Are you that kind of person?
I never took you for that type.

531
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:54,275
Say anything you want,
but I can't lie or act...

532
00:30:54,299 --> 00:30:56,045
to save my life.

533
00:30:56,069 --> 00:30:57,976
Just thinking about it...

534
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,339
makes me nervous.

535
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:02,470
I can't do it. Never!

536
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:05,680
I'm an expert in the field,
so you just have to sit next to me.

537
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:09,609
Can't you see how desperate I am
to be asking you this?

538
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:12,226
Please, Ms. Song. Please.

539
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:14,619
Ms. Song, please!

540
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:17,089
No, I can't.

541
00:31:17,859 --> 00:31:20,305
I'm sorry, Mr. Yoon.

542
00:31:20,329 --> 00:31:21,890
Ms. Song!

543
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:23,829
- Ms. Song!
- I'm sorry.

544
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:25,099
Ex-in-law!

545
00:31:25,299 --> 00:31:26,430
Sorry!

546
00:31:28,269 --> 00:31:30,569
How can she be this cold?

547
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:35,970
Maybe I shouldn't have
taught her how to say no.

548
00:31:36,839 --> 00:31:39,680
Unbelievable. So what now?

549
00:31:40,579 --> 00:31:42,210
Yes, it's me.

550
00:31:42,309 --> 00:31:43,779
Do you know what the daughter said?

551
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:48,319
Really? She's fond of Jae Seok?

552
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:52,319
Gosh, she has good taste in men.

553
00:31:53,589 --> 00:31:57,200
He's the type that ladies love,
you see.

554
00:32:00,069 --> 00:32:01,869
Really?

555
00:32:02,099 --> 00:32:03,845
They already agreed
to another date?

556
00:32:03,869 --> 00:32:06,140
My gosh. When?

557
00:32:07,109 --> 00:32:08,369
At the gallery on the weekend?

558
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:14,109
No, I didn't hear the news.

559
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:17,295
You know how boys
never speak about these things.

560
00:32:17,319 --> 00:32:18,750
He must be embarrassed.

561
00:32:20,119 --> 00:32:23,119
I really hope this works out.

562
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:25,265
Of course.

563
00:32:25,289 --> 00:32:28,460
Sure thing. Thank you so much.

564
00:32:32,059 --> 00:32:33,369
My gosh.

565
00:32:49,849 --> 00:32:53,119
Physically, this team seems to be
closer to our actors.

566
00:32:54,089 --> 00:32:56,859
You three aren't muscular enough.

567
00:32:57,890 --> 00:32:59,035
They may seem that way,

568
00:32:59,059 --> 00:33:00,906
but you'll be surprised
when you see their bodies.

569
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:03,976
Besides, it won't show
when they're running around.

570
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,700
I'm not sure about that.
Viewers these days are so keen.

571
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,599
I mean it's not like you can make
grown men taller, right?

572
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:13,269
Let's see you in action then.

573
00:33:13,609 --> 00:33:14,809
Let's begin.

574
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:16,956
Guys, get ready.

575
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:18,480
- Sure.
- Let's do this.

576
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:21,450
Come on.

577
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,630
He's like the guy from
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon".

578
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:36,936
They want to intimidate us.

579
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,230
They're just being flashy.
What matters are the basics.

580
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:42,529
When it comes to basics,
no one can outdo us.

581
00:33:43,339 --> 00:33:44,339
You trust me, right?

582
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:46,509
- Yes, Joon Seon.
- Of course.

583
00:33:47,769 --> 00:33:49,515
Next up is Good Action Company.

584
00:33:49,539 --> 00:33:51,539
Sure thing. Come on.

585
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,170
They're not that bad.

586
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,046
They're all on point.

587
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:20,170
You can tell that
they practiced a lot.

588
00:34:20,969 --> 00:34:24,639
We'll see.
It's all about the end results.

589
00:34:37,219 --> 00:34:38,296
Sir,

590
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,035
I think these were swapped with
the ones that were partly sawed.

591
00:34:41,059 --> 00:34:42,130
What?

592
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:44,400
They were swapped?

593
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:47,276
Are you kidding me?

594
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,675
What are you going to do?

595
00:34:48,699 --> 00:34:50,570
These weren't sawed in advance?

596
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,340
Joon Seon,

597
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:54,885
- these are the real deal.
- Don't waste our time.

598
00:34:54,909 --> 00:34:57,785
- These weren't sawed in advance.
- I'm fine, so just do it.

599
00:34:57,809 --> 00:35:00,856
- Trust me.
- But these won't break.

600
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,785
It's fine. Just come at me.

601
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:04,949
- Joon Seon.
- I gave you an order. Come on.

602
00:35:38,519 --> 00:35:40,626
That's how you do it!

603
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:42,789
What did I tell you?

604
00:35:44,289 --> 00:35:46,219
Are you guys all right?
You can get up now.

605
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:47,559
That was awesome!

606
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:50,599
He's just full of spite.

607
00:35:51,429 --> 00:35:52,800
Attention, bow.

608
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,400
Guys, that was amazing!

609
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,890
(Episode 32)

610
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:09,529
Again. This time,
throw your body at me.

611
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:10,830
Sure.

612
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:19,739
Again.

613
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,839
Loosen your shoulders
and add weight to your legs.

614
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,760
This is all about your strength.

615
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:27,550
Got it.

616
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:40,436
- That's it. Good job.
- Really?

617
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:41,905
Yes, you'll get better at this
in no time.

618
00:36:41,929 --> 00:36:43,259
Can I go again?

619
00:36:43,759 --> 00:36:44,799
Bring it on.

620
00:36:57,579 --> 00:36:58,810
Okay, go.

621
00:37:10,319 --> 00:37:12,435
What did I tell you?
I told you to trust me.

622
00:37:12,459 --> 00:37:14,036
Joon Seon, you're the best.

623
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:15,629
You're amazing!

624
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:22,376
Ho Beom, how was it to witness...

625
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,969
the gap between our abilities?

626
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:29,109
Don't just stand there.
Go and bring the car around.

627
00:37:29,709 --> 00:37:31,956
Your scenes were too flashy.

628
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:34,379
I suggest you go back
to practicing the basics.

629
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:36,525
Good luck, Ho Beom.

630
00:37:36,549 --> 00:37:38,049
See you next time, Ho Beom.

631
00:37:38,549 --> 00:37:39,620
I mean, Mr. Jang.

632
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:43,519
I bet that stings.
It would, considering his pride.

633
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,989
By the way, Joon Seon.
Are you okay?

634
00:37:47,459 --> 00:37:49,335
You endured the pain
of those square bars.

635
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:51,846
Of course.
You know how thick my bones are.

636
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:54,370
That was nothing.

637
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:56,640
- Joon Seon.
- Joon Seon!

638
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,045
Really? Dad, that's awesome!

639
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:01,616
My gosh.

640
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,385
Smiley, Dad's going
to be in a TV series.

641
00:38:03,409 --> 00:38:05,489
He's the stuntman
for the main actor. Awesome, right?

642
00:38:05,609 --> 00:38:06,586
Right?

643
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:08,855
Seo Jin says you did well too.
She's proud of you.

644
00:38:08,879 --> 00:38:10,680
Dad, you're awesome.

645
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:12,496
Mom? She's right here.

646
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,195
Yes, I'll put her on. Just a second.

647
00:38:14,219 --> 00:38:16,490
It's fine. I'm driving, aren't I?

648
00:38:18,389 --> 00:38:22,099
Mom can't talk
since she's driving right now.

649
00:38:22,629 --> 00:38:24,846
A party? Of course I'll be there.

650
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:26,629
See you later. Bye!

651
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,515
Couldn't you at least
pretend to be excited?

652
00:38:31,539 --> 00:38:33,270
He's in a great mood today.

653
00:38:34,039 --> 00:38:35,439
You're always so cold.

654
00:38:36,009 --> 00:38:38,849
Anyway, there's a party later.
Seo Jin and I are going,

655
00:38:38,949 --> 00:38:40,180
so don't stop us.

656
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:46,365
Really? Joon Seon got the part?

657
00:38:46,389 --> 00:38:49,496
Yes, you know how he achieves
what he puts his mind to at times.

658
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,060
If only he's like that all the time.

659
00:38:51,219 --> 00:38:53,889
Right. He's like that sometimes.

660
00:38:54,189 --> 00:38:55,506
He must be super excited.

661
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:57,506
Gosh, you have no idea.

662
00:38:57,530 --> 00:38:59,406
He's already gathering people
for a barbecue.

663
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:01,000
So when will you be home?

664
00:39:02,669 --> 00:39:03,800
I don't know.

665
00:39:04,139 --> 00:39:06,539
Wouldn't it be best
if I went home late?

666
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:08,756
Mom will be in a good mood...

667
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:11,015
and I hate to bring her down.

668
00:39:11,039 --> 00:39:13,879
That's all the more reason
for you to come home early.

669
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:17,650
You should use this chance
to get on her good side.

670
00:39:18,319 --> 00:39:21,090
So you'll be home early, right?
I'll see you later.

671
00:39:26,659 --> 00:39:29,430
I heard the news. Congratulations.

672
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:36,479
(I heard the news. Congratulations.)

673
00:39:38,569 --> 00:39:40,810
Yes, ma'am. What a surprise.

674
00:39:41,939 --> 00:39:44,780
She won't be able
to fit me in then?

675
00:39:45,409 --> 00:39:47,610
No, of course she needs
her math classes.

676
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:51,949
I'll try and accommodate her
later in the evening then.

677
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:53,449
How about 9 p.m.?

678
00:39:54,889 --> 00:39:58,090
Of course I should. Sure.

679
00:39:58,759 --> 00:39:59,930
Thank you.

680
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,569
Attention!

681
00:40:10,569 --> 00:40:13,615
Are you all enjoying your food?

682
00:40:13,639 --> 00:40:15,455
- Sure.
- Of course!

683
00:40:15,479 --> 00:40:17,240
Thank you so much.

684
00:40:17,579 --> 00:40:19,149
Please tell me
you're considering it.

685
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:22,319
I'm sure you're all aware of it,
but you're here today...

686
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:24,149
to congratulate...

687
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:28,360
the successful TV debut
of my company,

688
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:29,990
Good Action Company.

689
00:40:34,089 --> 00:40:35,935
My awesome dad.

690
00:40:35,959 --> 00:40:37,829
Give it up for my dad!

691
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:41,305
Gosh, thank you
for the thundering applause.

692
00:40:41,329 --> 00:40:42,946
That's enough.

693
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:44,576
We're good.

694
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,045
He can never play it cool.

695
00:40:46,069 --> 00:40:48,915
Let him have his moment.
It's a great day for him.

696
00:40:48,939 --> 00:40:51,526
First, Jeong Bong and Jong Soo.

697
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:53,310
You guys did well.

698
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:56,456
Since it's an honorable day,
I'd like...

699
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,350
to express my gratitude.

700
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:02,319
I wouldn't be here today
if it weren't for these two people.

701
00:41:03,019 --> 00:41:07,490
Even though I lack in so many ways,
they have always supported me.

702
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:09,000
First,

703
00:41:10,129 --> 00:41:13,505
it's my mother. Mom!

704
00:41:13,529 --> 00:41:15,970
Stop it. You're embarrassing me.

705
00:41:16,769 --> 00:41:19,769
Good for you, Ok Boon. I'm jealous.

706
00:41:20,939 --> 00:41:22,279
Also,

707
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,009
I haven't been able
to say this often,

708
00:41:25,279 --> 00:41:27,586
there's someone I love...

709
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:30,550
and truly admire. It's...

710
00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:34,596
my aunt who's sitting
next to my dad.

711
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:35,795
Me?

712
00:41:35,819 --> 00:41:39,430
What on earth
are you thanking me for?

713
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:42,629
Mom, I'll just tell everyone.

714
00:41:42,829 --> 00:41:46,199
You see,
Auntie invested her money...

715
00:41:46,769 --> 00:41:48,769
- She invested what?
- What's going on?

716
00:41:49,899 --> 00:41:52,740
Joon Seon means...

717
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:57,016
that I've been
supporting him mentally.

718
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,086
I bought him a few drinks...

719
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:01,625
when he needed a friend to talk to.

720
00:42:01,649 --> 00:42:03,449
- Right?
- I see.

721
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:05,019
I thought otherwise.

722
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:10,420
Anyway, enjoy until you're too full.

723
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:13,029
- Let's enjoy.
- Thanks.

724
00:42:15,459 --> 00:42:17,199
Mom, do you want some soda?

725
00:42:17,399 --> 00:42:18,946
Na Hee, pour Mom some soda.

726
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:20,829
Mom, here you go...

727
00:42:21,529 --> 00:42:23,800
Na Hee, there's some behind you.

728
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:25,910
Sure thing.

729
00:42:31,779 --> 00:42:33,279
Let me pour you some.

730
00:42:33,610 --> 00:42:35,980
I'm good. I'll stick to water.

731
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:41,096
But I already brought you some.
Just drink some.

732
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:43,495
I'm fine, all right?
I don't want any.

733
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:46,389
Must you be this petty over nothing?

734
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:49,529
He's right.
Just let her pour you a glass.

735
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:52,045
You're embarrassing me, Mom.
Here you go.

736
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:53,930
- I said I'm fine!
- My gosh.

737
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:55,540
Mom, gosh.

738
00:42:56,939 --> 00:43:00,639
I said I didn't want any.

739
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:13,449
Na Hee?

740
00:43:14,019 --> 00:43:15,389
Da Hee, no.

741
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:21,189
We need to talk.

742
00:43:21,959 --> 00:43:23,600
I don't have anything to say to you.

743
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:32,509
I know I disappointed you...

744
00:43:33,769 --> 00:43:35,410
and I'm truly sorry.

745
00:43:37,110 --> 00:43:38,110
But...

746
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:40,649
how long will this go on?

747
00:43:42,579 --> 00:43:43,779
Until when...

748
00:43:45,089 --> 00:43:46,665
will you avoid me?

749
00:43:46,689 --> 00:43:47,720
Why?

750
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:50,290
Are you upset by
how I'm treating you?

751
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:52,459
Does it hurt to be ignored?

752
00:43:53,129 --> 00:43:56,129
No, I just can't
assess what's going on.

753
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:00,329
Should I be living with you
in this house...

754
00:44:00,970 --> 00:44:03,500
or should I disappear
from your sight?

755
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:06,670
Mom,

756
00:44:08,139 --> 00:44:10,615
I didn't move back in
to torture you.

757
00:44:10,639 --> 00:44:13,185
What a tear-jerking thing to say.

758
00:44:13,209 --> 00:44:15,896
You have a funny way of showing
how much I mean to you.

759
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,425
You think you're so smart...

760
00:44:17,449 --> 00:44:19,925
and you think you rule the world.

761
00:44:19,949 --> 00:44:22,036
So don't ask me
and do whatever you want.

762
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:25,089
It's not like you ever
ask for my opinion first.

763
00:44:28,089 --> 00:44:31,029
What about this upsets you the most?

764
00:44:32,269 --> 00:44:35,346
Is it because you've become
a laughing stock at the market...

765
00:44:35,370 --> 00:44:38,470
or is it because
you feel bad for me?

766
00:44:40,009 --> 00:44:41,139
What?

767
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:45,250
The decision wasn't
easy for me either.

768
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:48,049
I tried to keep our marriage
for as long as I could.

769
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:50,019
I knew what I meant to you.

770
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,220
I know how much you count on me.

771
00:44:52,519 --> 00:44:53,690
But...

772
00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:58,789
my life was just too miserable.

773
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:00,990
I was dying out of loneliness.

774
00:45:01,389 --> 00:45:03,176
I wanted to live my life too.

775
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,306
Why? Why were you miserable?

776
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:07,405
Why were you so lonely?

777
00:45:07,429 --> 00:45:10,000
You got married because
you were head over heels for him.

778
00:45:12,909 --> 00:45:14,210
I had a miscarriage.

779
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:20,779
I lost a baby...

780
00:45:21,309 --> 00:45:22,679
about two and a half years ago.

781
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:26,289
Wait.

782
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:28,419
What?

783
00:45:31,289 --> 00:45:32,659
It was my fault.

784
00:45:34,289 --> 00:45:36,129
I stubbornly overexerted myself.

785
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:40,100
At first,
I just thought of it as bad luck.

786
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:42,899
We could always get pregnant again.

787
00:45:43,570 --> 00:45:44,669
But...

788
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:47,940
I couldn't let it go.

789
00:45:48,879 --> 00:45:51,980
Due to guilt,
I wanted to force a pregnancy.

790
00:45:52,379 --> 00:45:54,279
And Gyu Jin found it
too hard to bear.

791
00:45:56,980 --> 00:45:58,350
We kept arguing.

792
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:00,630
We argued every second
that we were awake.

793
00:46:01,019 --> 00:46:03,259
The arguments led to scars...

794
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,929
and we kept hurting
each other even more.

795
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:12,070
I didn't want to let it continue.

796
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:15,570
Mom, I...

797
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,440
didn't think
my life should continue like that.

798
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:20,909
That's why...

799
00:46:21,009 --> 00:46:22,039
You...

800
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:27,080
How could you...

801
00:46:27,809 --> 00:46:31,049
hide such a huge deal from me?

802
00:46:31,149 --> 00:46:32,649
How could I tell you?

803
00:46:33,019 --> 00:46:36,090
How could I when I knew
you'd be heartbroken?

804
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:41,029
You were upset enough
because of Joon Seon and Ga Hee,

805
00:46:43,129 --> 00:46:45,035
so how could I add on to that?

806
00:46:45,059 --> 00:46:46,745
You should have told me though!

807
00:46:46,769 --> 00:46:48,645
If you thought of me as your mother,

808
00:46:48,669 --> 00:46:50,275
you would've told me.

809
00:46:50,299 --> 00:46:53,039
Even then, you thought little of me.

810
00:46:54,539 --> 00:46:58,139
Normally, kids seek their parents
when they need comforting,

811
00:46:58,879 --> 00:47:02,556
not when they want
to share good news.

812
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:05,450
Have you ever thought of that,
you brat?

813
00:47:11,590 --> 00:47:12,759
Mom...

814
00:47:14,789 --> 00:47:16,529
Mom, I'm so sorry.

815
00:47:18,299 --> 00:47:20,070
I guess I'm too selfish.

816
00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:21,870
I'm sorry.

817
00:47:25,409 --> 00:47:26,470
Na Hee...

818
00:47:39,049 --> 00:47:40,149
Na Hee?

819
00:47:43,690 --> 00:47:46,706
Her eyes were blotchy.
I'm sure she was crying.

820
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:49,405
My gosh. Mom must've hit her.

821
00:47:49,429 --> 00:47:50,960
No way.

822
00:47:51,059 --> 00:47:52,529
I'll go to her.

823
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:01,940
Na Hee?

824
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:04,480
Are you okay?

825
00:48:08,610 --> 00:48:10,549
Don't be too upset.

826
00:48:10,779 --> 00:48:14,166
She just counted on you
so much that...

827
00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:15,360
Da Hee.

828
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,929
Can you turn off the lights?
I'd rather go to sleep.

829
00:48:22,759 --> 00:48:24,929
Sure. All right.

830
00:48:26,299 --> 00:48:28,600
Don't think about it
and just get some sleep.

831
00:48:29,269 --> 00:48:32,110
You will feel better
after a good night's sleep.

832
00:49:01,129 --> 00:49:03,000
Hey, you're up.

833
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,570
Yes, Dad.
I have something to tell you.

834
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:11,940
Okay. I have something
to tell you too.

835
00:49:14,679 --> 00:49:16,779
I'll move out, Dad.

836
00:49:17,450 --> 00:49:18,519
I'm sorry.

837
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:22,159
Okay. You can do that.

838
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:29,559
I thought it would be better
for you to keep seeing each other.

839
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:32,169
But perhaps
I didn't think this through.

840
00:49:33,169 --> 00:49:36,870
Don't resent your mom though.

841
00:49:39,169 --> 00:49:40,309
I don't.

842
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:43,809
I have no right to be resentful.

843
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:57,159
You should get more sleep.
You didn't sleep a wink last night.

844
00:50:00,029 --> 00:50:02,235
Na Hee wants to move out.

845
00:50:02,259 --> 00:50:03,500
And I said okay.

846
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:07,745
I should go check the meters.

847
00:50:07,769 --> 00:50:10,870
The weather has become warmer,
but the heating bill is still high.

849
00:50:20,279 --> 00:50:21,350
Yes.

850
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:26,690
Do you have a moment?
I have something to ask you.

851
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:28,789
Sure.

852
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:33,159
All right.

853
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:35,629
What's the matter, Dr. Song?

854
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:40,669
I'm here as your friend,
not as an employee.

855
00:50:40,799 --> 00:50:42,940
Really? I'm even more curious.

856
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:44,500
What is it?

857
00:50:46,070 --> 00:50:48,015
You mentioned
your sister's house yesterday.

858
00:50:48,039 --> 00:50:49,639
The one you're hiring
a house sitter for.

859
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:52,885
Is the offer still valid?

860
00:50:52,909 --> 00:50:53,950
Of course.

861
00:50:54,809 --> 00:50:57,480
But why did you change
your mind in a day?

862
00:50:59,549 --> 00:51:01,289
Is something wrong?

863
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:05,830
No. I just think it'll be better
for me to move out.

864
00:51:06,330 --> 00:51:08,830
But I don't have much money to spare
at the moment.

865
00:51:09,029 --> 00:51:11,000
So I'd appreciate it...

866
00:51:11,059 --> 00:51:13,299
if I could stay at your sister's
until I sort things out.

867
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,299
You don't have to be sorry.
It's empty anyway.

868
00:51:18,769 --> 00:51:20,909
So when will you move in?
This weekend?

869
00:51:22,210 --> 00:51:24,210
Can I move in today?

870
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,025
Here is your large
sweet and sour chicken...

871
00:51:32,049 --> 00:51:33,365
and two fried chickens.

872
00:51:33,389 --> 00:51:35,289
- Thank you. Have a nice day.
- Bye.

873
00:51:37,190 --> 00:51:38,190

00:51:40,529 --> 00:51:41,559
Ok Boon.

875
00:51:42,059 --> 00:51:43,605
You startled me. What?

876
00:51:43,629 --> 00:51:48,000
I just thought you've been
spacing out the whole day.

877
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:52,740
I have a lot on my mind today.

878
00:51:52,870 --> 00:51:55,716
So don't bother me
and leave me alone. Okay?

879
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:56,840
Okay.

880
00:52:00,909 --> 00:52:04,820
Gosh, I'm just like
everyone's punching bag.

881
00:52:05,590 --> 00:52:07,549
Maybe I should move out
and stand on my own.

882

- Joon Seon.
- Auntie.

883
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:16,035
I'm at the cafe
where we met that time.

884
00:52:16,059 --> 00:52:18,206
Come over here
without telling Mom and Dad.

885
00:52:18,230 --> 00:52:19,230
Discreetly.

886
00:52:19,899 --> 00:52:20,899
Okay.

887
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:23,775
Auntie. Ta-da.

888
00:52:23,799 --> 00:52:25,745
Gosh, what is this?

889
00:52:25,769 --> 00:52:27,385
It's my gift for you.

890
00:52:27,409 --> 00:52:28,669
It's a cosmetics set.

891
00:52:28,710 --> 00:52:31,610
It's expensive,
so don't share it with anyone. Okay?

892
00:52:32,039 --> 00:52:34,226
You know Mom isn't
in a good mood now.

893
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:36,980
So I couldn't bring it to the store.

894
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:40,365
You didn't have to do this though.

895
00:52:40,389 --> 00:52:43,466
It's nothing
compared to what you did for me.

896
00:52:43,490 --> 00:52:45,365
I wish I could get you
something better,

897
00:52:45,389 --> 00:52:48,306
but this is just the beginning yet.

898
00:52:48,330 --> 00:52:50,706
I'll give you something huge later.

899
00:52:50,730 --> 00:52:52,570
And I will pay you back
every penny for sure.

900
00:52:53,269 --> 00:52:54,269
Okay.

901
00:52:59,309 --> 00:53:00,710
Joon Seon.

902
00:53:00,909 --> 00:53:01,909
Yes?

903
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:09,349
The thing is...
About the investment money.

904
00:53:11,549 --> 00:53:14,250
Are you moving out again
just like this?

905
00:53:14,990 --> 00:53:16,190
Give me the coat over there.

906
00:53:17,559 --> 00:53:19,866
Na Hee,
can you reconsider just once more?

907
00:53:19,890 --> 00:53:22,476
You should at least wait for Mom
and see her before you leave.

908
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:25,029
If you leave like this,
you might never make up with her.

909
00:53:25,299 --> 00:53:28,345
Ga Hee, don't just stand there.
Do something.

910
00:53:28,369 --> 00:53:30,170
What can I do?

911
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:32,609
It's not like she wants to do this.

912
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:35,809
Do you have a place to stay?

913
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:38,339
Yes. I asked my friend a favor.

914
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:41,180
I'm sorry.

915
00:53:41,950 --> 00:53:44,549
This is when I'm supposed
to help you as your older sister.

916
00:53:45,279 --> 00:53:48,190
But I'm in no better position,
so there's nothing I can do.

917
00:53:48,849 --> 00:53:50,289
I feel so ashamed.

918
00:53:51,890 --> 00:53:55,230
It's okay.
I've never helped you either.

919
00:53:56,329 --> 00:53:58,230
Give me that. Let me carry one.

920
00:54:00,529 --> 00:54:02,640
I don't think this is right.

921
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:13,509
Are you leaving now?

922
00:54:14,579 --> 00:54:15,680
Yes, Dad.

923
00:54:16,349 --> 00:54:18,055
I saw a taxi in front of the house.

924
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:19,879
I was wondering why,
but I guess it's for you.

925
00:54:20,349 --> 00:54:22,190
Do you have a place to stay?

926
00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:24,190
Yes.

927
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:38,900
I'll send you my address.

928
00:54:39,970 --> 00:54:41,210
See you, Dad.

929

930
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:47,210
I'm leaving.

931
00:54:51,019 --> 00:54:52,699
I should go.
You don't have to walk me out.

932
00:54:55,519 --> 00:54:56,690
Bye, Na Hee.

933
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:58,265
Be careful.

934
00:54:58,289 --> 00:55:00,059
Make sure to call us.

935
00:55:17,339 --> 00:55:18,609

Who said you could move out?

937
00:55:27,150 --> 00:55:28,150
Mom.

938
00:55:28,549 --> 00:55:31,990
Are you running away like that
after breaking my heart?

939
00:55:32,059 --> 00:55:34,630
What am I supposed to do?
You brat.

940
00:55:37,829 --> 00:55:38,859
You...

941
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:40,700
You can't leave.

942
00:55:41,170 --> 00:55:42,230
Come back in.

943
00:55:44,470 --> 00:55:45,500
You can't go.

944
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:48,339
I'm not letting you go.
You're not going anywhere.

945
00:55:54,109 --> 00:55:55,509
You should've told me.

946
00:55:57,380 --> 00:56:01,190
You should've cried
your eyes out in my arms.

947
00:56:06,329 --> 00:56:08,490
It must've been so hard.

948
00:56:09,730 --> 00:56:12,460
It must've been so painful.

949
00:56:14,069 --> 00:56:15,069
Mom.

950
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:19,099
I'm sorry.

951
00:56:21,740 --> 00:56:22,940
It's my fault.

952

You're so cold-hearted.

954
00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:33,019
What do you think
you have your mom for?

955
00:56:33,150 --> 00:56:35,319
Why did you put up
with the whole thing by yourself?

956
00:56:35,519 --> 00:56:38,460
How could you do that?
You brat...

957
00:56:40,990 --> 00:56:43,160
- Mom.
- You silly thing.

958
00:56:46,730 --> 00:56:49,470
- You silly thing.
- Mom, I'm sorry.

959
00:56:50,539 --> 00:56:52,470
I'm so sorry.

960

00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:13,089
I'm sorry.

962
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:19,769
I'm sorry, Mom.

What are you doing? Get off me.

964
00:57:27,369 --> 00:57:29,285
Just stay still, Dad.

965
00:57:29,309 --> 00:57:31,809
Just for a minute.
No, just five minutes.

966
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:33,349
Let go of me.

967

00:58:05,579 --> 00:58:07,950
It's a perfect day
to do a good deed.

975
00:58:08,609 --> 00:58:11,380
How many messages has he sent?

976
00:58:12,049 --> 00:58:13,819
He's so tenacious.

977
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:23,676
I'm really desperate.

978
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:26,269
Can you please help me this once?
Please, Ms. Song.

979
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:29,269
It's not something I can do for you.

980
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:39,609
You're making me feel bad.

981
00:58:42,450 --> 00:58:43,519
No, no.

982
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:45,019
I can't do it.

983
00:58:48,349 --> 00:58:50,196
- Hold on tight.
- Everyone!

984
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:52,065
Will you see who's here?

985
00:58:52,089 --> 00:58:53,505
- My gosh.
- Hey!

986
00:58:53,529 --> 00:58:54,960
Ok Boon, it's you.

987
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:56,700
- Hello.
- Hi.

988
00:58:57,059 --> 00:58:59,876
Is your stomach... How do you feel?

989
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:01,299
I feel fine.

990
00:59:01,430 --> 00:59:03,376
Did you learn a lot?

991
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:05,440
What if I can't keep up?

992
00:59:06,269 --> 00:59:09,680
Don't miss any more classes.
Attend them all.

993
00:59:09,740 --> 00:59:12,640
Our instructor said that
if we get good enough,

994
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:14,560
we can even enter
amateur competitions and such.

995
00:59:15,250 --> 00:59:16,995
My gosh, look who's here.

996
00:59:17,019 --> 00:59:19,795
It's our president and his wife.

997
00:59:19,819 --> 00:59:21,966
It's been a while since I saw you.

998
00:59:21,990 --> 00:59:24,059
- You too, Ms. Jang.
- Yes.

999
00:59:24,259 --> 00:59:26,990
Why did you two come in together?

1000
00:59:27,829 --> 00:59:29,436
We met on the way here.

1001
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:33,470
I was leaving my store
when Mr. Yang passed by.

1002
00:59:33,829 --> 00:59:34,930
I see.

1003
00:59:39,809 --> 00:59:41,585
- Will I manage?
- You'll do fine.

1004
00:59:41,609 --> 00:59:45,485
This time, we'll learn
the turn and embrace.

1005
00:59:45,509 --> 00:59:49,250
1, 2, 3, and 4. Okay.

1006
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:51,755
Ready, go.

1007
00:59:51,779 --> 00:59:54,990
1, 2, 3, and 4.

1008
01:00:00,690 --> 01:00:03,430
My gosh. Sorry. I'm sorry.

1009
01:00:03,529 --> 01:00:05,059
I'm sorry.

1010
01:00:06,869 --> 01:00:10,775
What are you doing?
Will you concentrate, Mr. Yang?

1011
01:00:10,799 --> 01:00:13,869
Okay, I'll concentrate. Concentrate.

1012
01:00:18,609 --> 01:00:21,950
My gosh.
Why is there always more trash?

1013
01:00:22,509 --> 01:00:25,126
Are we done? I'll tie up the bag.

1014
01:00:25,150 --> 01:00:27,990
There's still room for more.

1015
01:00:28,890 --> 01:00:31,559
While we're at it,
let's clean Cho Yeon's room too.

1016
01:00:33,759 --> 01:00:34,866
My gosh.

1017
01:00:34,890 --> 01:00:36,960
Is this the expiration date?

1018
01:00:39,099 --> 01:00:40,200
Throw this away too.

1019
01:00:40,869 --> 01:00:43,876
Wow, how many years
did she keep this for?

1020
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:46,140
Throw it away. Toss it.

1021
01:00:48,309 --> 01:00:51,279
I'll finish up here.
You check her closet.

1022
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:54,186
Throw away
everything she doesn't wear.

1023
01:00:54,210 --> 01:00:56,226
Really? Without asking her?

1024
01:00:56,250 --> 01:00:59,420
If we ask, will she let us
throw anything away?

1025
01:01:00,049 --> 01:01:02,196
She'll say she'll wear it later.

1026
01:01:02,220 --> 01:01:04,835
I bet she has a stash of
underwear and socks with holes.

1027
01:01:04,859 --> 01:01:07,166
Don't hold back.
Throw everything away.

1028
01:01:07,190 --> 01:01:08,390
Okay.

1029
01:01:19,039 --> 01:01:20,640
My goodness.

1030
01:01:20,910 --> 01:01:24,109
There's more to throw away
than she can wear.

1031
01:01:24,210 --> 01:01:25,680
What's this?

1032
01:01:26,910 --> 01:01:30,255
What should we do about her?

1033
01:01:30,279 --> 01:01:31,619
Throw this away.

1034
01:01:31,819 --> 01:01:33,250
Put this in there.

1035
01:01:33,450 --> 01:01:34,819
And this too.

1036
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:40,089
I bought this piece myself.

1037
01:01:40,829 --> 01:01:43,099
It's a good piece
considering the artist is new.

1038
01:01:44,230 --> 01:01:47,170
I liked the untypical
sense of adventure.

1039
01:01:48,869 --> 01:01:50,140
It's just my style.

1040
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,369
Like you, Jae Seok.

1041
01:01:53,839 --> 01:01:54,869
What?

1042
01:01:57,039 --> 01:02:00,210
Well, I'm not that adventurous.

1043
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:08,750
- Excuse me, Ms. Seo.
- Yes?

1044
01:02:09,819 --> 01:02:12,936
I don't think you and I
suit each other.

1045
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:15,005
I'm not that classy a person...

1046
01:02:15,029 --> 01:02:16,660
Do you feel uncomfortable here?

1047
01:02:17,029 --> 01:02:19,630
Next time,
we can meet where you like.

1048
01:02:19,970 --> 01:02:22,299
I don't mind a game of bowling,

1049
01:02:22,569 --> 01:02:24,000
or drinking at a cart bar.

1050
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:26,146
I'll accommodate you.

1051
01:02:26,170 --> 01:02:28,186
No, it's not a matter of that.

1052
01:02:28,210 --> 01:02:30,140
It's a lie that
you have a girlfriend.

1053
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:32,480
Right?

1054
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:35,650
Sweetie.

1055
01:03:09,079 --> 01:03:10,549
Did you wait for a long time?

1056
01:03:13,450 --> 01:03:16,720
Hello. I'm Jae Seok's girlfriend,
Song Da Hee.

1057
01:03:26,930 --> 01:03:28,200
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1058
01:03:32,799 --> 01:03:35,785
A glass of lemonade
after cleaning up...

1059
01:03:35,809 --> 01:03:37,186
brings back memories.

1060
01:03:37,210 --> 01:03:39,456
I used to feel so good
when we had...

1061
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:42,785
a shot of soju with a tray of fruit.

1062
01:03:42,809 --> 01:03:43,920
Me too.

1063
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:46,765
I feel so relaxed these days.

1064
01:03:46,789 --> 01:03:48,196
There's so little stress.

1065
01:03:48,220 --> 01:03:51,720
Right. I even feel healthier too.

1066
01:03:51,990 --> 01:03:53,059
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1067
01:03:53,359 --> 01:03:55,390
Are you two still slacking off?

1068
01:03:55,630 --> 01:03:58,059
Couldn't you chop up
some vegetables in your free time?

1069
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:00,906
Cho Yeon. We didn't slack off.

1070
01:04:00,930 --> 01:04:03,116
Don't nag and go on inside...

1071
01:04:03,140 --> 01:04:04,446
and get changed.

1072
01:04:04,470 --> 01:04:06,339
Yes, get changed.

1073
01:04:06,539 --> 01:04:08,015
Okay, I will.

1074
01:04:08,039 --> 01:04:09,980
You two nag more than I do.

1075
01:04:13,079 --> 01:04:14,180
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1076
01:04:16,180 --> 01:04:19,196
Cho Yeon will be shocked
when she sees her room.

1077
01:04:19,220 --> 01:04:22,519
Of course. She'll wonder if her room
was always that big.

1078
01:04:22,549 --> 01:04:24,559
I feel so much better
since we cleaned it up.

1079
01:04:25,019 --> 01:04:26,089
Hey.

1080
01:04:26,289 --> 01:04:29,976
Who... Who cleaned up my room?

1081
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,160
What? I did...

1082
01:04:32,829 --> 01:04:33,976
with Ga Yeon.

1083
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,599
Are you angry
we didn't ask for permission?

1084
01:04:37,170 --> 01:04:40,545
My clothes.
The clothes wrapped up in a cloth.

1085
01:04:40,569 --> 01:04:42,815
Where... What did you do with that?

1086
01:04:42,839 --> 01:04:44,216
Where's the wrapping cloth?

1087
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:47,049
The wrapping cloth?
Was there something like that?

1088
01:04:47,809 --> 01:04:49,950
Some old clothes and makeup...

1089
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:54,420
Things you don't use...
We threw them out in a trash bag.

1090
01:04:54,650 --> 01:04:55,789
What?

1091
01:04:55,890 --> 01:04:56,960
My gosh.

1092
01:04:57,589 --> 01:04:59,065
What's the matter?

1093
01:04:59,089 --> 01:05:00,966
What was inside? Cho Yeon!

1094
01:05:00,990 --> 01:05:03,735
Stop! Stop!

1095
01:05:03,759 --> 01:05:06,569
Stop, misters. Stop the truck!

1096
01:05:06,670 --> 01:05:08,970
- Stop! Mister!
- Stop the truck.

1097
01:05:09,099 --> 01:05:12,170
Stop for a moment. Stop.

1098
01:05:15,609 --> 01:05:18,085
- What's the matter?
- Sorry, mister.

1099
01:05:18,109 --> 01:05:22,180
I threw away something
I shouldn't have.

1100
01:05:22,279 --> 01:05:25,825
The trash bag... I need to get it.

1101
01:05:25,849 --> 01:05:27,366
Can you help me?

1102
01:05:27,390 --> 01:05:30,136
How are we to know which is yours
out of dozens of bags?

1103
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:33,565
Give up. We have to get to
the next area before 40 past.

1104
01:05:33,589 --> 01:05:36,035
No, mister, please. I need it back.

1105
01:05:36,059 --> 01:05:37,335
Go back home.

1106
01:05:37,359 --> 01:05:40,476
- Please, sir. Let me look.
- We're busy too.

1107
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:42,829
- Please.
- You can't do this.

1108
01:05:43,029 --> 01:05:44,845
What's going on now?

1109
01:05:44,869 --> 01:05:46,716
Isn't that the kimbap lady?

1110
01:05:46,740 --> 01:05:49,045
- What's up? Are they fighting?
- It's really important.

1111
01:05:49,069 --> 01:05:50,585
Hey, Chi Su.

1112
01:05:50,609 --> 01:05:52,956
I just need to look inside.

1113
01:05:52,980 --> 01:05:54,426
- We're busy too.
- Mister.

1114
01:05:54,450 --> 01:05:56,825
It's really important to me.

1115
01:05:56,849 --> 01:05:59,819
Just 10 minutes. No, just 5 minutes.

1116
01:05:59,890 --> 01:06:02,750
You just took it,
so it'll be in the back.

1117
01:06:02,849 --> 01:06:05,035
I'll just take it out.
Please, mister.

1118
01:06:05,059 --> 01:06:06,436
You can't, okay?

1119
01:06:06,460 --> 01:06:08,130
- Move or you'll get hurt.
- Mister!

1120
01:06:08,359 --> 01:06:09,436
Mister.

1121
01:06:09,460 --> 01:06:10,599
What's the matter.

1122
01:06:10,730 --> 01:06:14,400
My clothes... My clothes...
The girls threw them out.

1123
01:06:14,730 --> 01:06:16,646
My mom's handkerchief was in there.

1124
01:06:16,670 --> 01:06:18,545
I need to get it back!

1125
01:06:18,569 --> 01:06:19,815
What should I do?

1126
01:06:19,839 --> 01:06:23,180
I need to find that trash bag.
What am I to do?

1127
01:06:41,289 --> 01:06:43,630
Mister, what are you doing?

1128
01:06:44,099 --> 01:06:45,329
You can't go.

1129
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,569
Cho Yeon asked for just 10 minutes!

1130
01:06:49,130 --> 01:06:50,670
She said it's important!

1131
01:06:50,799 --> 01:06:53,386
What's wrong with you people today?

1132
01:06:53,410 --> 01:06:55,146
We have work to do!

1133
01:06:55,170 --> 01:06:57,285
Who are you?

1134
01:06:57,309 --> 01:06:59,680
What are you to her? Her husband?

1135
01:06:59,779 --> 01:07:00,809
No!

1136
01:07:01,509 --> 01:07:02,549
I'm...

1137
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:05,549
I'm...

1138
01:07:07,589 --> 01:07:09,349
a man who likes her!

1139
01:07:12,390 --> 01:07:14,660
I like her, okay?

1140
01:07:20,029 --> 01:07:21,099
What?

1141
01:07:21,269 --> 01:07:25,069
So just give her 10 minutes!

1142
01:07:26,569 --> 01:07:27,839
My goodness.

1143
01:07:28,910 --> 01:07:30,509
What's wrong?

1144
01:07:30,940 --> 01:07:33,109
- What's the matter?
- What's wrong?

1145
01:08:02,339 --> 01:08:04,940
(Once Again)

1146
01:08:05,079 --> 01:08:07,549
Has it been that long already?
Jae Seok?

1147
01:08:09,250 --> 01:08:11,825
Tell me if there's any place
you want to go.

1148
01:08:11,849 --> 01:08:15,025
There is just one place
I'd like to go to.

1149
01:08:15,049 --> 01:08:17,690
Ok Ja, come here.
You know Mr. Yang's...

1150
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:20,990
Ok Ja, I was just
on my way to your store.

1151
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:28,329
I have a feeling
this will go really well. So...

1152
01:08:28,470 --> 01:08:31,069
Can't you let me keep
my promise to Seo Young?

1153
01:08:31,170 --> 01:08:32,476
I like Na Hee, you know.

1154
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:33,646
But...

1155
01:08:33,670 --> 01:08:35,140
I'm not asking for your permission.

1156
01:08:35,339 --> 01:08:37,710
I just wanted to be honest.
