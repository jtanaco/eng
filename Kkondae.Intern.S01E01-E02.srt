1
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,295
- Give me the phone number.
- Hey.

2
00:00:11,319 --> 00:00:14,659
- I told you not to sell anything.
- Come on, cut me some slack.

3
00:00:15,159 --> 00:00:17,036
- Just record it here.
- You can't sell this here.

4
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,405
- You're making me frustrated.
- Goodness.

5
00:00:18,429 --> 00:00:20,645
- My gosh.
- Stop making me angry.

6
00:00:20,669 --> 00:00:21,646
- Hey, lady.
- What's with them?

7
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:23,616
This stop is
Jeonchan Borough Office Station.

8
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,739
This stop is
Jeonchan Borough Office Station.

9
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:30,380
This stop is
Jeonchan Borough Office Station.

10
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:32,950
The doors are on your right.

11
00:00:38,419 --> 00:00:40,266
- My gosh.
- What is he doing?

12
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,995
- What was that?
- Man, that's disgusting.

13
00:00:42,019 --> 00:00:43,896
- Why doesn't he just stay at home?
- My gosh.

14
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,759
What's with that old man?

15
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,305
The definition of "kkondae" is...

16
00:00:50,329 --> 00:00:53,500
slang for
an old person or a teacher.

17
00:00:54,769 --> 00:00:56,000
Peek-a-boo.

18
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,275
You should sit here.

19
00:00:58,299 --> 00:00:59,516
It must be tough
to bring up a child.

20
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:00,970
No, it's all right.

21
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:05,116
But not all old people are kkondaes.

22
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,656
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

23
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,126
Exactly. Why did you ignore me?

24
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,156
- Pardon?
- "Pardon"? You didn't see my text?

25
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:14,150
How can you fall asleep
while you talk to your senior?

26
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:15,365
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:15,389 --> 00:01:17,895
I can't believe kids these days.
Why don't you sleep forever?

28
00:01:17,919 --> 00:01:18,960
I'm sorry.

29
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:22,359
Young kkondaes also exist.

30
00:01:22,529 --> 00:01:24,300
What's up with your jacket?

31
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,475
A kkondae is a person who forces
others to accept...

32
00:01:31,499 --> 00:01:36,080
their old-fashioned beliefs
regardless of how old they are.

33
00:01:36,309 --> 00:01:38,580
And he's one of them.

34
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,035
Move aside.

35
00:01:50,059 --> 00:01:51,766
Can't you see
that this is the elderly's seat?

36
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:54,166
I have the right to sit here too.

37
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:57,059
Someone as young as you
should just obey the elders.

38
00:01:57,559 --> 00:01:58,630
How dare you talk back?

39
00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:02,845
What's your deal?

40
00:02:02,869 --> 00:02:05,139
What? What did you say?

41
00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:07,040
What?

42
00:02:07,809 --> 00:02:09,710
You little punk. Hey!

43
00:02:12,279 --> 00:02:14,309
Hey. Hey.

44
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:17,595
Don't make me look back.

45
00:02:17,619 --> 00:02:21,349
I've been studying too much
that I got anemia.

46
00:02:21,749 --> 00:02:23,436
You should've told me.

47
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,659
I did.

48
00:02:25,119 --> 00:02:27,189
I said I had the right
to sit there too.

49
00:02:28,789 --> 00:02:29,830
Hey.

50
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,430
Hey.

51
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,206
What a weird, old man.

52
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,569
- Why did you bother him?
- He's anemic.

53
00:02:36,839 --> 00:02:38,069
What's wrong with him?

54
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:41,469
Have your meals on time.

55
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:46,849
How could a young man like you
be anemic?

56
00:02:47,279 --> 00:02:48,779
Kids these days...

57
00:02:49,619 --> 00:02:51,349
are so weak.

58
00:02:52,249 --> 00:02:53,490
It's a problem.

59
00:02:54,789 --> 00:02:59,430
He was a one-of-a-kind kkondae.

60
00:03:01,189 --> 00:03:04,260
(Episode 1)

61
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,445
- Hello.
- Hello.

62
00:03:12,469 --> 00:03:14,646
- Hello.
- Hello.

63
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:16,379
- Hello.
- Hey.

64
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,339
- Good morning.
- You too.

65
00:03:34,189 --> 00:03:36,789
How dare that punk to come to work
later than the general manager?

66
00:03:43,499 --> 00:03:44,476
I'm sorry for being late.

67
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,539
And...

68
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,909
I was his underling.

69
00:04:03,059 --> 00:04:04,095
- Yeol Chan.
- Yes?

70
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:06,330
Have you finalized the proposal
for the private brands?

71
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:08,629
- No, sir.
- What?

72
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:11,176
Actually, I'm almost done.

73
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,930
What's taking you so long?

74
00:04:13,969 --> 00:04:16,716
I told you to pick a few
from the ones that were rejected.

75
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,345
I'm organizing it right now.

76
00:04:18,369 --> 00:04:20,839
Just give it to me.

77
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,010
Yes, sir.

78
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,210
Here you go.

79
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:29,349
What? What's wrong with this?

80
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:33,089
What is this?
Why is the quality so poor?

81
00:04:34,489 --> 00:04:35,620
Did you do something?

82
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:42,690
What? Are you still
in the World Cup season?

83
00:04:43,099 --> 00:04:46,376
Why are you still using
the 2002 version of the program?

84
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,377
There was a problem
with compatibility.

85
00:04:47,401 --> 00:04:51,370
You should update your program
and yourself as well.

86
00:04:52,539 --> 00:04:53,570
Yes, sir.

87
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:56,585
I'll update it right now
and re-print this.

88
00:04:56,609 --> 00:04:59,310
Don't! Just sit still.

89
00:05:01,549 --> 00:05:05,195
Mr. Kim, pick out a few
from the list.

90
00:05:05,219 --> 00:05:07,150
Cup noodles or packaged ones?

91
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,589
- The former.
- Yes, sir.

92
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,630
Sir... Sir.

93
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:15,806
Should I buy some coffee?

94
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,900
Just stay still! Don't do anything!

95
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:20,775
I know you're just an intern,

96
00:05:20,799 --> 00:05:22,775
but how could you do so poorly?

97
00:05:22,799 --> 00:05:25,539
Come on.
He could get us some coffee.

98
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:27,445
He seems like
the best intern so far.

99
00:05:27,469 --> 00:05:29,215
Who? Him?

100
00:05:29,239 --> 00:05:32,356
Hey, Mi Jin. Do you like him?

101
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,626
Don't be ridiculous.

102
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,450
Then why are you siding
with him? Why?

103
00:05:35,849 --> 00:05:38,279
Are you trying to seduce him?

104
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:56,029
What do young people think?

105
00:05:57,239 --> 00:06:00,870
Yeol Chan, be honest.
Which ramyeon is the tastiest?

106
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:03,856
May I be honest?

107
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,179
Of course. That's why you're here.

108
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:10,849
I think Joonsoo Food's Sam Ramyeon
made an outstanding change.

109
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,250
Our Ong Ramyeon changed
in taste as well.

110
00:06:14,489 --> 00:06:16,359
But it doesn't seem
as tasty as before.

111
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,260
What did you say?

112
00:06:20,489 --> 00:06:23,476
How dare an intern
blabber about such things?

113
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,775
If you love Joonsoo Food so much,
you should've joined them.

114
00:06:25,799 --> 00:06:27,199
Why did you even choose to join us?

115
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:28,970
Do you even know
how great our ramyeon is?

116
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,979
Let's call it Fiery Squid Ramyeon.

117
00:06:41,409 --> 00:06:43,650
That was our intern's idea.

118
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,849
- What?
- That was...

119
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:48,166
Yeol Chan's idea.

120
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:50,965
He mentioned it last time.

121
00:06:50,989 --> 00:06:53,606
I submitted that, sir.

122
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:56,575
What are you guys talking about?

123
00:06:56,599 --> 00:06:58,159
That was my idea.

124
00:06:58,359 --> 00:07:01,205
Hey, are you sure
you two aren't dating?

125
00:07:01,229 --> 00:07:02,445
We're not.

126
00:07:02,469 --> 00:07:04,870
Then why do you keep siding
with him?

127
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:11,179
I must've gotten confused.

128
00:07:11,409 --> 00:07:14,080
Fiery Squid Ramyeon was your idea.

129
00:07:14,609 --> 00:07:16,726
She's right.
It was your idea.

130
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,455
- Yes, you're right.
- You're right.

131
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,919
- It was his idea.
- Hey!

132
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:22,719
It's a bit too late, isn't it?

133
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,820
You ruined my mood already.
Forget it.

134
00:07:26,659 --> 00:07:28,429
This never happened.

135
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,037
Sir...

136
00:07:30,061 --> 00:07:32,859
Also, who is it
that keeps giving him work?

137
00:07:33,669 --> 00:07:35,099
Stop giving him work!

138
00:07:45,979 --> 00:07:47,786
Hey, Mom. What is it?

139
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:49,450
Are there still
some side dishes left?

140
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:53,120
I heard at small studio apartments,
your neighbors steal your food.

141
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,390
That never happened.

142
00:07:55,419 --> 00:07:57,859
Does that mean you don't need
any extra side dishes?

143
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,205
I made some geotjeori at work.
It was tasty,

144
00:08:01,229 --> 00:08:03,000
so I packed some for you.

145
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,190
Did you get a part-time job again?

146
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:10,140
You recently got surgery
for the slipped disc.

147
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,916
Don't do anything
and just stay at home!

148
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:17,080
Do you even know how it feels
to do nothing?

149
00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:32,419
How's work?

150
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:42,805
I get scolded at
no matter what I do.

151
00:08:42,829 --> 00:08:45,175
That's the life of an intern.

152
00:08:45,199 --> 00:08:46,415
Just endure it.

153
00:08:46,439 --> 00:08:49,640
I was so jealous of you
when I heard you got in.

154
00:08:50,909 --> 00:08:52,010
Were you?

155
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,260
Hey.

156
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:07,206
What's wrong?

157
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:10,100
You can't even drink.
Don't scare me like this.

158
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:12,159
Gosh.

159
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:24,439
I can do well.

160
00:09:26,949 --> 00:09:29,010
I really can.

161
00:09:33,289 --> 00:09:36,959
Darn it.
Why won't they give me a chance?

162
00:09:55,709 --> 00:09:57,986
- Hey, Yeol Chan.
- Yes, sir?

163
00:09:58,010 --> 00:09:59,255

his ox head rice soup recipe for
our product, ox head noodle soup.

against the owner of the restaurant.

always joked around
and asked them for their recipe.

their rice soup, have you?

Of course, customers stopped coming,

314
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:50,286
and that's when we released
our ox head noodle soup,

315
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:52,796
so they figured they could
make a case around this.

(2020 61st Trade Day)

487
00:38:22,799 --> 00:38:23,869
Congratulations.

488
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:27,369
Please share your speech.

489
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,809
Our chairman hates spicy food.

490
00:38:32,879 --> 00:38:35,609
And I brought Spicy Chicken Ramyeon
to a guy like him.

491
00:38:36,049 --> 00:38:38,126
He turned me down
well over a hundred times.

492
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:40,095
But regardless of his taste,

493
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:42,619
he accepted the opinions
of the younger generation.

494
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:44,095
I'd like to give the honor...

495
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:46,660
to Chairman Namgoong Pyo,
the father of ramyeon.

496
00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:57,330
And we won't stop here
with an increase in our export.

497
00:38:57,729 --> 00:38:59,640
We'll continue to use...

498
00:38:59,739 --> 00:39:02,109
Spicy Chicken brand
to lead the K-food craze.

499
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:03,340
Thank you.

501
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:18,560
All right!

502
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:21,505
Let's celebrate
the 200 million dollars in export,

503
00:39:21,529 --> 00:39:23,936
achieved by
General Manager Ga Yeol Chan!

504
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,399
- Goodness.
- Congratulations! All right!

505

- All right!

- Congratulations!

507
00:39:33,999 --> 00:39:36,440
Seung Jin, you need to
chug that down at once.

508
00:39:36,869 --> 00:39:40,056
Mr. Ga, I really look up to...

509
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:43,455
the sharp eye you have
for seeing into the future.

510
00:39:43,479 --> 00:39:46,225
So what about our incentives?
I'll be frank.

511
00:39:46,249 --> 00:39:48,196
- How much will it be? I'm curious.
- The incentive?

512
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:49,220
That's my main focus.

513
00:39:49,889 --> 00:39:51,489
I'll bring it up.

514
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:55,830
All right, then.

515
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:59,529
Mr. Ga, could you show us?

516
00:40:07,909 --> 00:40:10,940
- Shall I?
- All right!

517
00:40:11,109 --> 00:40:15,786
All right, now. Everyone,
let's give him our attention.

518
00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:17,180
Attention, please.

519
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:42,946
Everyone, check this out.

520
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:45,279
- Move aside.
- He looks cool.

521
00:40:47,139 --> 00:40:52,879
- Ga Yeol Chan!
- Ga Yeol Chan!

522
00:41:12,499 --> 00:41:14,070
- Bravo!
- Nice!

523
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:17,769
That was awesome!

524
00:41:18,739 --> 00:41:22,649
Can a company get-together
be this simple?

525
00:41:22,749 --> 00:41:24,680
My score is usually around
two hundred points.

526
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,196
- My goodness!
- Goodness.

527
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:30,125
Look at this sunshine.

528
00:41:30,149 --> 00:41:33,090
Even after partying so hard,
the sun is still up.

529
00:41:33,659 --> 00:41:35,739
Having afternoon get-togethers
is the trend nowadays.

530
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:37,766
When I heard that
get-togethers are also...

531
00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:39,430
a part of work, I thought to myself,

532
00:41:40,529 --> 00:41:41,806
"If I ever become a superior,"

533
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:44,200
"I will schedule my get-togethers
during working hours."

534
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:48,609
What? It's already 6 p.m.

535
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,556
What are you doing? Go home, now.

536
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:52,580
Right.

537
00:41:53,979 --> 00:41:56,350
I value my personal time,
so I should get going.

538
00:41:58,180 --> 00:41:59,850
- Goodbye.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

539
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,759
"What are you doing? Go home, now."

540
00:42:05,859 --> 00:42:08,330
We're so blessed.

their evening thanks to me.

544

Honey, you're getting promoted
today, right?

545
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:03,340
Come on. You should focus on
tending to the house.

546
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:06,279
What's the monthly pay
for a director?

547
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,879
20,000 dollars? 30,000 dollars?

548
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:12,249
Don't be so superficial.

549
00:44:12,479 --> 00:44:16,149

but all you care about is the money.

00:44:30,570 --> 00:44:31,800
Tell him to come in.

554
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,040
Yes, sir.

555
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:38,639
Sorry?

556
00:44:39,509 --> 00:44:41,156
You want me to take care
of the warehouses?

557
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:42,656
What did I do so wrong?

558
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,355
You didn't.

559
00:44:44,379 --> 00:44:45,550
Then what?

560
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:49,320
Don't tell me it's because I'm old.

561
00:44:50,149 --> 00:44:51,489
You know that...

562
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:54,806
people our age
are subjected to such things.

563
00:44:54,830 --> 00:44:58,259
I do, but why does it have to be me?

become successful.

You can't barge in like this, sir.

Sir.

570

No matter how much
I think about it,

571
00:46:22,409 --> 00:46:25,595
you shouldn't kick me out like this.

572
00:46:25,619 --> 00:46:27,220
I refuse to be ousted like this.

573
00:46:27,850 --> 00:46:31,865
I was never there for my wife...

574
00:46:31,889 --> 00:46:33,720
when she was giving birth to
both of my kids.

575

I wasn't there for her.

579
00:46:45,639 --> 00:46:48,345
Why? Because I had work.

580
00:46:48,369 --> 00:46:51,485
You guys needed me!

581
00:46:51,509 --> 00:46:53,310
You said it had to be me!

582
00:46:56,249 --> 00:46:59,056
I dedicated everything
to this company.

583
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:01,619
What do you expect me to do
once I leave this place?

584
00:47:01,889 --> 00:47:03,929
Should I suddenly become
a loving father to my kids?

585
00:47:04,149 --> 00:47:05,909
Should I become a good son
to my late mother?

586
00:47:07,619 --> 00:47:10,105
You turned me into a workaholic,

587
00:47:10,129 --> 00:47:11,776
- so what do you expect?
- Hey.

588
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,560
Isn't the warehouse
also a part of Ongol?

589
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:17,499
You can work hard there as well.

590
00:47:17,729 --> 00:47:19,639
Is that why you're sending me
down south?

591
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:23,070
You're obviously telling me to quit.

I have nowhere else to go?

- It's not too late.

00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:24,810
Thank you.

648
00:52:24,969 --> 00:52:26,316
I'm sorry.

649
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:28,885
I know you guys are working hard,
but I won't be able to join you.

650
00:52:28,909 --> 00:52:31,256
But are you sure there will be
a job waiting for me?

651
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,425
I'm going to return
after I deliver this baby.

652
00:52:33,449 --> 00:52:35,619
- My goodness.
- Of course.

653
00:52:35,949 --> 00:52:37,566
Mr. Oh is back now.

654
00:52:37,590 --> 00:52:38,996
We'll visit you to see the baby.

655
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:40,859
You'd better.

656
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:42,830
Have a healthy baby.

657
00:52:43,830 --> 00:52:45,066
- That's so considerate of you.
- All right.

658
00:52:45,090 --> 00:52:47,600
- I got you a bigger present.
- My goodness.

659
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:49,875
I know how you must feel now.

660
00:52:49,899 --> 00:52:51,405
- Everyone, say it with me.
- My gosh.

661
00:52:51,429 --> 00:52:53,115
- Healthy baby!
- Healthy...

662
00:52:53,139 --> 00:52:54,340
- Healthy baby!
- Healthy baby!

663
00:52:54,770 --> 00:52:57,016
- Healthy baby!
- It's like I'm giving birth now.

664
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,340
Stop it!

665
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:04,010
She's just going to give birth to
a baby. What's all the fuss about?

666
00:53:04,310 --> 00:53:06,179
What happened with Mumbai Food?

667
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:07,950
You acted as if
you already got the deal.

668
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:09,320
Did they pull out?

669
00:53:09,949 --> 00:53:10,949
My gosh.

670
00:53:11,790 --> 00:53:12,790
Hello.

671
00:53:14,659 --> 00:53:15,830
Wait a minute, sir.

672
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:19,335
Mr. Ga, Mr. Rancho is on the phone.

673
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:22,070
- Okay.
- Mr. Rancho?

674
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:24,800
This is Ga Yeol Chan speaking.
Hello, Mr. Rancho.

675
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:29,869
Is that so? Thank you.

676
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:33,439
- We entered the Indian market now.
- Yes!

677
00:53:35,709 --> 00:53:38,056
Okay. I'll proceed as you said.

678
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:40,080
- We did it.
- I'm so happy.

679
00:53:40,649 --> 00:53:42,050
I can't believe this.

680
00:53:43,350 --> 00:53:44,350
Me?

681
00:53:45,189 --> 00:53:48,165
Have you ever had
Spicy Chicken Ramyeon?

682
00:53:48,189 --> 00:53:50,030
Are you teasing me now?

683
00:53:50,189 --> 00:53:53,699
You know that I'm dying to try it,
but I can't ever eat that.

684
00:54:02,810 --> 00:54:04,669
I made this just for you.

685
00:54:06,109 --> 00:54:07,316
(Hot Chicken Noodle)

686
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:09,456
It's Hot Chicken Noodle
without the chicken in it.

687
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:11,885
There's no chicken
in Hot Chicken Noodle?

688
00:54:11,909 --> 00:54:13,655
My goodness.
I must tell the world about this.

689
00:54:13,679 --> 00:54:16,949
Everyone, there's no chicken
in Hot Chicken Noodle!

690
00:54:27,959 --> 00:54:29,006
(Hot Chicken Noodle)

691
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:30,800
(Hot Chicken Noodle)

692
00:54:33,199 --> 00:54:34,540
(Hot Chicken Noodle)

693
00:54:36,969 --> 00:54:39,409
(Hot Chicken Noodle)

694
00:54:43,550 --> 00:54:48,179
Now, you can try the Vegan
Hot Chicken Noodle.

695
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:50,119
Korea.

696
00:55:03,270 --> 00:55:06,415
My goodness. I can't believe
someone like him is working for me.

697
00:55:06,439 --> 00:55:08,810
- He's the best person for the job.
- Yes.

698
00:55:10,209 --> 00:55:12,185
What's the big deal
selling our products in India?

699
00:55:12,209 --> 00:55:14,956
I doubt that they would eat
a lot of ramyeon over there.

700
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:19,425
The scale of the market
for ramyeon in India is...

701
00:55:19,449 --> 00:55:21,020
one billion dollars.

702
00:55:21,179 --> 00:55:22,726
- He got our product in...
- But...

703
00:55:22,750 --> 00:55:24,296
if they can eat tandoori chicken,

704
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:26,195
can't they eat
Spicy Chicken Ramyeon?

705
00:55:26,219 --> 00:55:28,595
Do they have to get rid of beef?

706
00:55:28,619 --> 00:55:29,959
Or is it pork?

707
00:55:30,530 --> 00:55:32,806
Anyway, why would
they get rid of chicken?

708
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:36,945
It's not just about their religion.

709
00:55:36,969 --> 00:55:41,316
40 percent of the Indian population
is vegetarian.

710
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:43,816
It's the biggest
vegetarian-friendly country.

711
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:46,585
The total population of India
is 1.38 billion.

712
00:55:46,609 --> 00:55:47,816
What's 40 percent of that?

713
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:50,050
- Stop. Are you womansplaining me?
- 1.38 billion...

714
00:55:50,649 --> 00:55:52,796
But isn't this more suspicious
when you think about it?

715
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:55,379
He's not even a celebrity.
Why would he film the commercial?

716
00:55:55,919 --> 00:55:59,165
The moment the chairman
of Mumbai Food saw Mr. Ga,

717
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:00,935
he was smitten with Mr. Ga.

718
00:56:00,959 --> 00:56:05,159
Exactly. Could it be possible
that he has ties to the chairman?

719
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:07,760
What is it?

720
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:10,699
There's a rumor
that he's your boy toy too.

721
00:56:11,899 --> 00:56:13,145
What did you say, punk?

722
00:56:13,169 --> 00:56:15,199
Why are you getting mad?

723
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:17,540
Hold on.

724
00:56:18,209 --> 00:56:20,109
Dad. Dad.

725
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:21,986
Is it true that...

726
00:56:22,010 --> 00:56:24,155
you guys had a fling
when she was young?

727
00:56:24,179 --> 00:56:25,449
Hey, you...

728
00:56:27,179 --> 00:56:28,550
Oh, my gosh.

729
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:32,066
So you, that woman,
and Ga Yeol Chan...

730
00:56:32,090 --> 00:56:34,335
- are in a love triangle.
- Hey! You punk. Get out.

731
00:56:34,359 --> 00:56:36,629
- Get out!
- A love triangle.

732
00:56:38,689 --> 00:56:39,699
Fine. I'll leave.

733
00:56:41,959 --> 00:56:43,605
My gosh, if Yeol Chan was my son,

734
00:56:43,629 --> 00:56:45,469
things would've been so good. Right?

735
00:56:49,139 --> 00:56:50,139
Hey.

736
00:56:50,209 --> 00:56:51,209
You startled me.

737
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:57,425
Don't play innocent.

738
00:56:57,449 --> 00:56:58,949
Show us where your loyalty lies.

739
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:02,949
You'll be kicked out if things
go south for Ga Yeol Chan.

740
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:10,859
My gosh, this perfume is expensive.

741
00:57:11,459 --> 00:57:13,605
You're wearing expensive perfume,

742
00:57:13,629 --> 00:57:15,429
but why does it smell cheap?

743
00:57:16,929 --> 00:57:17,929
Gosh.

744
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:28,280
How come I can't find
any dirt on this guy?

745
00:57:29,209 --> 00:57:30,609
Exactly.

746
00:57:31,709 --> 00:57:34,895
My old man keeps saying that
instead of driving down...

747
00:57:34,919 --> 00:57:37,665
the company to the gutter,
he'd rather give it to someone else.

748
00:57:37,689 --> 00:57:38,666
What if he gives it...

749
00:57:38,690 --> 00:57:41,060
- to Ga Yeol Chan?
- My gosh.

750
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:43,189
- No way.
- Dig deeper.

751
00:57:43,490 --> 00:57:45,159
Dig more thoroughly, okay?

752
00:57:45,659 --> 00:57:47,875
You ought to give me something!

753
00:57:47,899 --> 00:57:50,070
Okay. I will.

754
00:57:50,169 --> 00:57:51,899
(Intern Recruitment
for the First Half)

755
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:55,070
My gosh. I don't think
they'll get the job done.

756
00:57:55,810 --> 00:57:58,070
When will the interns start working?

757
00:58:01,179 --> 00:58:02,609
Did you see this?

758
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:04,786
It's an Indian commercial
for ramyeon.

759
00:58:04,810 --> 00:58:06,726
- It's so funny.
- Let me see.

760
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:07,820
Hold on. Let me see.

761
00:58:08,250 --> 00:58:10,990
My gosh. Seriously? He used to
be an intern at my company.

762
00:58:11,149 --> 00:58:14,189
His last name was
really unique. Ga...

763
00:58:14,659 --> 00:58:16,129
Ga...

764
00:58:17,429 --> 00:58:19,236
- Ga Yeol Chan.
- Ga Yeol Chan?

765
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:21,506
Why is he in this commercial?

766
00:58:21,530 --> 00:58:22,776
Isn't it so funny?

767
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,476
- Yes. Totally.
- It's so weird.

768
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:27,340
That jerk, Ga Yeol Chan,
used to work for Ongol.

769
00:58:27,570 --> 00:58:28,639
Ongol?

770
00:58:28,939 --> 00:58:31,585
Then, why didn't he say that?
It wasn't on his resume.

771
00:58:31,609 --> 00:58:34,109
That means
he wants to hide something.

772
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:37,786
Okay. I got an idea.

773
00:58:37,810 --> 00:58:39,850
This is it. Great.

774
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:55,476
My goodness.

775
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:56,500
Gosh.

776
00:58:57,399 --> 00:58:58,976
I can't do this.

777
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,915
It's obvious that
this wasn't the baby's poop.

778
00:59:01,939 --> 00:59:03,645
It's definitely from an adult.

779
00:59:03,669 --> 00:59:06,909
The previous security guard
was good at this.

780
00:59:07,709 --> 00:59:08,956
They kicked out all the good ones.

781
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:10,709
Why did they hire someone like him?

782
00:59:12,179 --> 00:59:13,850
You should call
other security guards.

783
00:59:14,919 --> 00:59:16,750
Throw that out on your way out.

784
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,000
(Ong Ramyeon)

785
00:59:46,879 --> 00:59:47,879
Ongol.

786
00:59:48,119 --> 00:59:51,020
(Ong Ramyeon)

787
01:00:05,699 --> 01:00:06,969
Yes? Hello?

788
01:00:08,570 --> 01:00:09,570
Who?

789
01:00:10,270 --> 01:00:11,409
Ahn Sang Jong?

790
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:14,909
My archenemy...

791
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:17,925
and my one and only rival...

792
01:00:17,949 --> 01:00:20,250
who works for Joonsoo Food,

793
01:00:27,590 --> 01:00:29,135
All right. Here they come!

794
01:00:29,159 --> 01:00:30,236
Are they here?

795
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:31,905
- Well...
- Is it a man or a woman?

796
01:00:31,929 --> 01:00:34,730
One man and one woman.
Bring me their resumes.

797
01:00:35,129 --> 01:00:36,945
All right, stay focused.
I'll have it.

798
01:00:36,969 --> 01:00:38,006
Why do you look so nervous?

799
01:00:38,030 --> 01:00:39,216
I'm not nervous.

800
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:40,845
- You can see them for yourself.
- Tell me.

801
01:00:40,869 --> 01:00:42,240
- A woman?
- Let me see.

802
01:00:44,709 --> 01:00:45,780
Attention, please.

803
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:50,310
Say hello to them.

804
01:00:51,010 --> 01:00:54,320
For the next six months, they'll be
a part of Marketing and Sales,

805
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:56,520
Ms. Lee Tae Lee and Joo Yoon Soo.

806
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:59,619
Hello, I'm Lee Tae Lee.

807
01:00:59,689 --> 01:01:03,189
You're right. My name sounds
like "Italy", Lee Tae Lee.

808
01:01:03,389 --> 01:01:05,800
But I haven't been there yet.

809
01:01:06,129 --> 01:01:09,060
Nice to meet you.
Tae Lee, Tae Lee, Lee Tae Lee.

810
01:01:10,369 --> 01:01:12,429
What's with this awful introduction?

811
01:01:16,369 --> 01:01:17,885
She seems very witty.

812
01:01:17,909 --> 01:01:19,209
Yes, your turn.

813
01:01:22,439 --> 01:01:24,649
He... Hello.

814
01:01:26,219 --> 01:01:29,119
I'm Joo Yoon Soo. Nice to meet you.

815
01:01:29,219 --> 01:01:30,250
Gosh.

816
01:01:31,550 --> 01:01:33,560
Why does he sound like a goat?

817
01:01:37,429 --> 01:01:39,929
Why did the ones I gave
the worst scores make the cut?

818
01:01:42,129 --> 01:01:43,129
Well.

819
01:01:44,469 --> 01:01:45,800
Why do we only have two interns?

820
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:48,369
Didn't you say
we'll get three in total?

821
01:01:49,939 --> 01:01:52,369
It's because
they got here way too early.

822
01:01:52,469 --> 01:01:53,716
It's not time yet.

823
01:01:53,740 --> 01:01:55,679
- We still have hope.
- Yes.

824
01:01:55,949 --> 01:01:58,449
Will it be a woman?
I hope she's pretty.

825
01:02:51,369 --> 01:02:52,500
Hello!

826
01:02:53,439 --> 01:02:56,010
I'm the senior intern
who'll begin as of today,

827
01:02:56,639 --> 01:02:57,869
Lee Man Sic.

828
01:03:25,270 --> 01:03:27,369
Why are you here, Mr. Lee?

829
01:03:28,639 --> 01:03:29,669
Who are you?

830
01:03:31,770 --> 01:03:33,139
Do you know me?

831
01:03:39,980 --> 01:03:41,050
You're...

832
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:45,320
You're...

833
01:03:58,570 --> 01:04:01,050
(We thank Lee Min Ji, Kim Hyun Mok,
Kwon Soo Hyun, Heo Il Hoo.)

834
01:04:23,629 --> 01:04:25,189
(Kkondae Intern)

835
01:04:25,290 --> 01:04:27,675
There are no relationships
that are 100 percent bad...

836
01:04:27,699 --> 01:04:29,746
- in our lives.
- You're here.

837
01:04:29,770 --> 01:04:32,816
Something good that happens now
might begin something bad,

838
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:34,915
and something
that's seemingly bad now...

839
01:04:34,939 --> 01:04:37,345
may become the beginning
of something good.

840
01:04:37,369 --> 01:04:39,786
Do you want a cup of morning coffee?

841
01:04:39,810 --> 01:04:41,655
Do you want
a cold cup of iced coffee?

842
01:04:41,679 --> 01:04:44,109
So you're planning on doing this?
