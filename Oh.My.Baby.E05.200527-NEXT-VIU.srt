1
00:00:26,165 --> 00:00:30,145
(Good job!)

2
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:35,429
(Good job!)

3
00:00:37,058 --> 00:00:40,877
It's us grown-ups who really need compliments.

4
00:00:43,098 --> 00:00:44,417
Good job, Mr. Han.

5
00:00:56,948 --> 00:00:59,077
As much as I'll be here on time at 8am,

6
00:00:59,077 --> 00:01:02,167
please make sure I can leave every day at 7pm.

7
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:04,617
I expect to get paid extra even if you're 10 minutes late.

8
00:01:04,617 --> 00:01:06,057
And I don't work on weekends.

9
00:01:06,057 --> 00:01:08,458
If you want a premium service such as baby massages...

10
00:01:08,458 --> 00:01:12,148
and premium baby food, you need to pay 300 dollars more.

11
00:01:12,397 --> 00:01:14,378
Do you have any questions?

12
00:01:15,968 --> 00:01:18,397
- We'll go broke if we are late... - Don't.

13
00:01:18,397 --> 00:01:20,518
Should I ask her? No?

14
00:01:23,537 --> 00:01:25,687
If I get off work early, will I get a discount?

15
00:01:27,408 --> 00:01:29,727
My goodness, I didn't know you guys were married.

16
00:01:30,777 --> 00:01:33,598
My gosh, I guess you really weren't homeless after all.

17
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:38,538
Then what about that other kid? Was that your second child?

18
00:01:40,387 --> 00:01:41,437
Is this your second marriage?

19
00:01:42,628 --> 00:01:44,708
Did you have an affair?

20
00:01:45,257 --> 00:01:47,348
My goodness, I guess that must be it.

21
00:01:48,068 --> 00:01:49,318
Did they really have an affair?

22
00:01:49,927 --> 00:01:51,048
My goodness.

23
00:01:51,897 --> 00:01:54,887
- Goodbye. - See you at our aerobics class!

24
00:01:54,908 --> 00:01:56,357
- Bye! - Goodbye.

25
00:01:57,307 --> 00:01:58,387
Did you recommend her, Mom?

26
00:01:58,807 --> 00:01:59,928
This is absurd.

27
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:02,458
My gosh, this is exhausting.

28
00:02:04,218 --> 00:02:06,798
It's so hard to get a babysitter.

29
00:02:06,917 --> 00:02:08,248
What are you going to do? Your hospital is going to open soon.

30
00:02:08,248 --> 00:02:11,208
I'll leave her at the daycare center until 3pm.

31
00:02:11,517 --> 00:02:12,807
Then I'll just have to bring her to my office.

32
00:02:12,987 --> 00:02:16,238
By the way, how do you know all those women?

33
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:17,578
How about you?

34
00:02:18,498 --> 00:02:19,678
I don't even want to talk about it.

35
00:02:24,697 --> 00:02:25,847
Ha Ri.

36
00:02:26,468 --> 00:02:27,958
What are you going to do now?

37
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:30,317
Why don't you help me prepare some stuff for the opening?

38
00:02:30,678 --> 00:02:32,187
How about we have some fun?

39
00:02:33,607 --> 00:02:36,828
Don't even think about it and pay me if you want my service.

40
00:02:37,878 --> 00:02:39,067
It was worth a try.

41
00:02:41,848 --> 00:02:43,037
Hello.

42
00:02:43,047 --> 00:02:44,507
Good to see you.

43
00:02:44,658 --> 00:02:46,238
This is our schedule for the day.

44
00:02:47,558 --> 00:02:49,007
(10am: I Sang and Ha Ri: My Child's First Friend of the Opposite Sex)

45
00:02:50,387 --> 00:02:51,608
(10am: I Sang and Ha Ri: My Child's First Friend of the Opposite Sex)

46
00:02:52,327 --> 00:02:53,507
Ms. Jang has a photoshoot?

47
00:02:53,697 --> 00:02:55,548
She takes her job very seriously.

48
00:02:55,767 --> 00:02:58,948
Her suspension only means that she needs to stay clear of her boss.

49
00:03:00,938 --> 00:03:02,118
Good morning.

50
00:03:14,648 --> 00:03:15,837
What's the photoshoot for?

51
00:03:17,757 --> 00:03:18,907
Don't be so obvious.

52
00:03:27,528 --> 00:03:29,217
It's an article on children having friends of the opposite sex.

53
00:03:33,098 --> 00:03:35,287
My gosh, you startled me.

54
00:03:35,368 --> 00:03:37,627
- What gives? - I'm sorry about that.

55
00:03:38,908 --> 00:03:41,127
This isn't your photoshoot though.

56
00:03:41,348 --> 00:03:43,207
I told Ha Ri to stay home...

57
00:03:43,207 --> 00:03:45,027
since I could manage this myself.

58
00:03:46,848 --> 00:03:50,138
It's a monthly series of ours, so Sang Hee knows what to do.

59
00:03:52,457 --> 00:03:54,708
Would she be in the mood to work when she was suspended?

60
00:03:55,387 --> 00:03:57,907
I told her to stay well away from this place.

61
00:04:02,667 --> 00:04:04,418
That's unnecessary camaraderie.

62
00:04:05,938 --> 00:04:09,388
- Sorry? - What kind of photos do you need?

63
00:04:09,568 --> 00:04:11,087
Unbelievable...

64
00:04:11,378 --> 00:04:14,228
I want the two of them shot from the front...

65
00:04:14,547 --> 00:04:16,627
- but leave some space up top. - Gosh.

66
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:18,368
I see right through you.

67
00:04:18,618 --> 00:04:20,897
Please leave some space up top for the title.

68
00:04:21,318 --> 00:04:22,468
I heard you.

69
00:04:25,618 --> 00:04:29,437
- Just a bit more... - I'll adjust as we go.

70
00:04:35,798 --> 00:04:39,517
(Episode 5: When We Wish to Believe in Fate)

71
00:04:47,907 --> 00:04:49,057
Mom.

72
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:53,668
Hold on. What brings you by?

73
00:04:57,048 --> 00:04:59,338
- Hello, sir. - Hi.

74
00:05:06,397 --> 00:05:07,618
Here you go.

75
00:05:08,697 --> 00:05:10,947
Why are you treating me like a patient?

76
00:05:11,097 --> 00:05:12,848
Because you are.

77
00:05:12,897 --> 00:05:15,257
You should stick to food that is easy to digest.

78
00:05:20,678 --> 00:05:21,897
Gosh.

79
00:05:22,808 --> 00:05:24,517
Are you aiming to be a professional guitarist?

80
00:05:24,517 --> 00:05:26,267
You shouldn't play in this condition of yours.

81
00:05:26,647 --> 00:05:28,697
My sore wrist goes back to my days working in diners.

82
00:05:29,118 --> 00:05:32,807
I can't believe the pain is back after a few guitar strokes.

83
00:05:33,788 --> 00:05:37,007
Don't overexert yourself. It's just a stupid guitar.

84
00:05:37,798 --> 00:05:39,778
It isn't for me.

85
00:05:40,197 --> 00:05:44,187
Playing "Spanish Romance" has been a lifelong dream of mine.

86
00:05:44,538 --> 00:05:45,837
Your father distracted me though,

87
00:05:45,837 --> 00:05:47,988
so I was only able to manage "Edelweiss".

88
00:05:48,637 --> 00:05:51,608
Darn it. When you fall for someone,

89
00:05:51,608 --> 00:05:54,428
you tend to fall hard.

90
00:05:57,678 --> 00:06:00,147
Luck seems to have found you in your later years though.

91
00:06:00,147 --> 00:06:02,147
Your cancer was detected in the early stages...

92
00:06:02,147 --> 00:06:05,108
and you have enough money to do what you want in your life.

93
00:06:05,288 --> 00:06:07,408
That doesn't mean a thing to me...

94
00:06:07,657 --> 00:06:09,377
because my body isn't what it used to be.

95
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:12,827
How great would it be to do everything I missed out on...

96
00:06:12,827 --> 00:06:15,877
when I had to work hard to keep food on the table?

97
00:06:19,798 --> 00:06:20,988
Exactly.

98
00:06:21,967 --> 00:06:23,858
We all should do what we want in life.

99
00:06:24,308 --> 00:06:26,788
It's why I want to give birth to a child.

100
00:06:27,007 --> 00:06:28,897
I'm not producing enough eggs...

101
00:06:28,947 --> 00:06:31,618
and my chances of pregnancy will only get slimmer...

102
00:06:31,618 --> 00:06:33,067
once I receive surgery for my endometriosis.

103
00:06:39,517 --> 00:06:40,978
It's nothing serious though.

104
00:06:45,827 --> 00:06:46,978
Wait.

105
00:06:48,267 --> 00:06:49,517
Was that about you?

106
00:06:52,197 --> 00:06:53,897
I can have the baby...

107
00:06:53,897 --> 00:06:55,538
and receive surgery for endometriosis.

108
00:06:55,538 --> 00:06:56,817
It's nothing.

109
00:06:57,007 --> 00:07:00,057
Now eat up before it gets cold.

110
00:07:00,678 --> 00:07:01,897
Come on.

111
00:07:02,207 --> 00:07:03,497
There you go.

112
00:07:08,788 --> 00:07:11,017
You want to go through IVF on your own?

113
00:07:11,017 --> 00:07:13,038
Did I misunderstand that or are you insane?

114
00:07:13,118 --> 00:07:14,838
I told you I was done wanting a marriage.

115
00:07:15,428 --> 00:07:16,678
I'd rather have a kid instead.

116
00:07:17,498 --> 00:07:19,628
You really are insane, aren't you?

117
00:07:19,628 --> 00:07:21,577
People will constantly judge me for this,

118
00:07:21,827 --> 00:07:23,478
so can you at least be on my side?

119
00:07:23,697 --> 00:07:26,368
I'm all on board with you buying green onions.

120
00:07:26,368 --> 00:07:29,358
But how can I support you when it's sperms you want to buy?

121
00:07:31,207 --> 00:07:32,658
I'm not buying anything.

122
00:07:33,538 --> 00:07:35,158
It'll be consensual.

123
00:07:35,608 --> 00:07:36,728
And keep your voice down.

124
00:07:38,577 --> 00:07:41,488
My friend, Ha Ri, I strongly am against this idea.

125
00:07:41,488 --> 00:07:43,637
- Well, I think it's perfect. - Wait.

126
00:07:45,318 --> 00:07:48,178
So you're seriously thinking about having this baby?

127
00:07:48,527 --> 00:07:51,478
On your own when it's hard enough to raise a child with a partner?

128
00:07:52,128 --> 00:07:54,548
Fine. Let's say that it's doable.

129
00:07:54,597 --> 00:07:57,447
What if a decent man comes your way?

130
00:07:59,068 --> 00:08:02,017
I tortured myself with that thought for 20 years.

131
00:08:02,467 --> 00:08:05,057
I'm done trying to meet a husband.

132
00:08:08,147 --> 00:08:11,067
My friend, don't close the door to your options...

133
00:08:11,178 --> 00:08:12,777
and reconsider the men...

134
00:08:12,777 --> 00:08:15,137
that you once dumped or took a pass on.

135
00:08:15,147 --> 00:08:18,488
You'll be surprised by the revelation it could bring you.

136
00:08:18,488 --> 00:08:21,707
Just keep digging, okay? There are many decent men out there.

137
00:08:21,728 --> 00:08:23,478
Like whom? Do you know anyone?

138
00:08:25,998 --> 00:08:28,048
Wait. What about my sister's husband?

139
00:08:28,228 --> 00:08:29,467
As you know,

140
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,798
he makes himself breakfast before going to work,

141
00:08:31,798 --> 00:08:33,298
get the kids to school,

142
00:08:33,298 --> 00:08:34,768
takes the family abroad every year,

143
00:08:34,768 --> 00:08:36,757
and only has eyes for my sister.

144
00:08:36,768 --> 00:08:37,887
I know.

145
00:08:38,607 --> 00:08:40,887
Your brother-in-law is the best.

146
00:08:41,308 --> 00:08:42,497
See?

147
00:08:42,678 --> 00:08:44,568
He must be here to shop with your sister.

148
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:46,427
That's him, right?

149
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:48,267
Did your sister lose weight?

150
00:08:48,447 --> 00:08:50,667
Check out her slender figure.

151
00:08:53,558 --> 00:08:54,708
Here.

152
00:08:55,888 --> 00:08:57,647
Who's the young woman?

153
00:08:58,197 --> 00:08:59,377
- Don't wait for me. - What?

154
00:09:00,158 --> 00:09:03,017
Eun Young, take a photo first.

155
00:09:03,627 --> 00:09:05,247
As evidence!

156
00:09:06,197 --> 00:09:07,348
Brother-in-law?

157
00:09:11,438 --> 00:09:12,728
Who is this woman?

158
00:09:16,877 --> 00:09:19,667
You have the wrong person.

159
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:22,938
Hold on. Wait. Stop right there.

160
00:09:23,217 --> 00:09:24,438
Stop!

161
00:09:24,918 --> 00:09:26,208
You have the wrong person.

162
00:09:26,418 --> 00:09:28,637
Oh, dear.

163
00:09:31,727 --> 00:09:33,478
I'm not your brother-in-law.

164
00:09:33,597 --> 00:09:35,147
- Stop! - Darn it.

165
00:09:36,398 --> 00:09:39,988
- I'm not who you think I am. - Stop!

166
00:09:40,438 --> 00:09:41,618
Wait!

167
00:09:42,337 --> 00:09:45,458
- I'm not your brother-in-law. - You are!

168
00:09:45,938 --> 00:09:47,157
I'm not!

169
00:09:50,107 --> 00:09:52,678
Eun Young used to think I was pathetic...

170
00:09:52,678 --> 00:09:54,738
for wanting to get married.

171
00:09:55,288 --> 00:09:56,918
As a successful app developer,

172
00:09:56,918 --> 00:09:58,838
she was on the verge of launching her startup.

173
00:09:59,318 --> 00:10:01,708
She went to an investor for an investment...

174
00:10:03,028 --> 00:10:04,747
and her life got turned upside down.

175
00:10:05,097 --> 00:10:06,777
A sudden attraction...

176
00:10:06,827 --> 00:10:09,047
led to marriage and pregnancy.

177
00:10:09,697 --> 00:10:12,068
Until then, she was confident...

178
00:10:12,068 --> 00:10:13,268
that she could be a working mom...

179
00:10:13,268 --> 00:10:15,517
which was tough even for Superwoman.

180
00:10:15,707 --> 00:10:18,458
That's because she had no idea she'd have pre-eclampsia...

181
00:10:18,607 --> 00:10:21,497
and would nearly die giving birth prematurely to twins.

182
00:10:23,908 --> 00:10:26,698
Who knew she'd go from dreaming to be a successful entrepreneur...

183
00:10:26,977 --> 00:10:28,667
to a woman fixated on childbirth?

184
00:10:28,947 --> 00:10:32,537
Who knew she'd one day run after her cheating brother-in-law?

185
00:10:33,357 --> 00:10:35,478
What I learned in my life of 39 years...

186
00:10:36,758 --> 00:10:39,578
is that good things just don't happen to you.

187
00:10:40,127 --> 00:10:42,618
Only the unfortunate smack you from behind.

188
00:10:43,127 --> 00:10:46,747
Nothing will happen if you don't take action.

189
00:10:47,337 --> 00:10:48,488
That is why...

190
00:10:49,408 --> 00:10:51,188
I must do something.

191
00:10:55,778 --> 00:10:57,058
Yoon Jae Young.

192
00:10:57,678 --> 00:10:58,678
From an objective point of view,

193
00:10:58,678 --> 00:11:00,828
he does have good qualities I'd want in my child.

194
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:04,267
If I asked him for his sperm though,

195
00:11:07,117 --> 00:11:08,677
he'd patronize me.

196
00:11:09,087 --> 00:11:11,948
(Potential sperm donor no. 2: Yoon Jae Young)

197
00:11:13,127 --> 00:11:14,308
Han I Sang.

198
00:11:14,367 --> 00:11:16,917
See? He's not that bad either.

199
00:11:17,627 --> 00:11:18,948
Most of all,

200
00:11:20,038 --> 00:11:21,218
he's kind of cool.

201
00:11:24,268 --> 00:11:25,458
Why am I smiling though...

202
00:11:26,538 --> 00:11:28,157
when he'd never agree to it?

203
00:11:29,148 --> 00:11:31,728
(Potential sperm donor no. 3: Han I Sang)

204
00:11:34,178 --> 00:11:35,637
Choi Kang Eu Ddeum.

205
00:11:37,217 --> 00:11:38,468
Of course.

206
00:11:42,028 --> 00:11:46,848
(Potential sperm donor no. 1: Choi Kang Eu Ddeum)

207
00:11:52,197 --> 00:11:53,948
Unbelievable.

208
00:11:58,837 --> 00:12:00,527
Eu Ddeum, can I talk to you?

209
00:12:01,648 --> 00:12:02,897
Sure thing.

210
00:12:05,477 --> 00:12:08,667
How can you write up a report like this?

211
00:12:08,747 --> 00:12:09,818
What a joke.

212
00:12:09,818 --> 00:12:12,108
A project proposal should be simple and impressive.

213
00:12:12,288 --> 00:12:15,087
The client should take a glimpse at it...

214
00:12:15,087 --> 00:12:18,147
and want to bring its advertisements to us.

215
00:12:18,497 --> 00:12:21,398
- It needs to be a sales pitch. - As if could do any better.

216
00:12:21,398 --> 00:12:24,118
How is it that you still can't get this right?

217
00:12:25,298 --> 00:12:26,718
I'll write up another one.

218
00:12:27,768 --> 00:12:28,908
So much for being a fast learner.

219
00:12:28,908 --> 00:12:30,988
He acted like he knew everything.

220
00:12:31,377 --> 00:12:32,627
Seriously.

221
00:12:34,778 --> 00:12:36,098
How will he ever survive?

222
00:12:38,217 --> 00:12:39,267
Eu Ddeum.

223
00:12:46,288 --> 00:12:48,108
This is a true or false quiz.

224
00:12:49,288 --> 00:12:51,037
True and false? I can do it.

225
00:12:51,497 --> 00:12:53,597
A man donated his sperm.

226
00:12:53,597 --> 00:12:57,268
Only one infertile couple may receive the sperm.

227
00:12:57,268 --> 00:12:58,466
True or false?

228
00:12:58,467 --> 00:13:01,207
Choi Kang Eu Ddeum. False.

229
00:13:01,207 --> 00:13:02,988
- Correct. - Yes.

230
00:13:04,138 --> 00:13:06,757
If we were to submit a proposal...

231
00:13:06,837 --> 00:13:09,228
to a fertility clinic regarding a sperm donation campaign...

232
00:13:10,178 --> 00:13:11,968
Because that's what you're interested in?

233
00:13:13,847 --> 00:13:15,167
Let's say that's true.

234
00:13:15,288 --> 00:13:17,447
What would be more effective,

235
00:13:17,447 --> 00:13:18,968
writing down...

236
00:13:18,987 --> 00:13:21,407
the benefits of advertising...

237
00:13:21,658 --> 00:13:23,137
or a quiz like just now?

238
00:13:23,827 --> 00:13:25,407
- A quiz. - Right?

239
00:13:25,997 --> 00:13:28,218
That's how you should write the proposal.

240
00:13:28,568 --> 00:13:30,827
Think of a concept the client may be interested in,

241
00:13:30,827 --> 00:13:33,638
and come up with a magazine ad or a video.

242
00:13:33,638 --> 00:13:34,887
Consult the reporters.

243
00:13:37,138 --> 00:13:38,927
You're like a lecturer.

244
00:13:44,548 --> 00:13:45,767
Ha Ri came.

245
00:13:45,947 --> 00:13:47,698
Why? Did something happen?

246
00:13:47,847 --> 00:13:50,568
No. She and Eu Ddeum...

247
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:53,708
were doing something in secret.

248
00:13:54,117 --> 00:13:55,978
With Eu Ddeum?

249
00:13:56,487 --> 00:13:57,608
What?

250
00:14:02,268 --> 00:14:04,377
They were in a conference room, so it was probably a meeting.

251
00:14:07,068 --> 00:14:08,588
What's wrong with my eyes?

252
00:14:08,908 --> 00:14:10,287
They sting.

253
00:14:10,438 --> 00:14:12,058
I've been staring at the monitor for too long.

254
00:14:12,508 --> 00:14:14,698
Hey. Open the windows and air out the place.

255
00:14:14,808 --> 00:14:15,997
Okay.

256
00:14:18,678 --> 00:14:19,968
So...

257
00:14:26,188 --> 00:14:27,907
What do you think...

258
00:14:28,528 --> 00:14:30,608
about sperm donation, now that you've heard about it?

259
00:14:33,327 --> 00:14:35,448
Not the proposal, but sperm donation?

260
00:14:36,327 --> 00:14:39,138
No, well... I just wonder if my explanation...

261
00:14:39,138 --> 00:14:40,917
was effective.

262
00:14:43,467 --> 00:14:46,377
But you can't receive sperm...

263
00:14:46,377 --> 00:14:47,558
even if you want to.

264
00:14:48,107 --> 00:14:49,198
Because you're single.

265
00:14:51,717 --> 00:14:53,598
I'm looking for a way.

266
00:14:54,247 --> 00:14:55,738
Something not illegal.

267
00:14:59,188 --> 00:15:00,368
What if...

268
00:15:00,717 --> 00:15:03,238
the child wants to know about the dad later?

269
00:15:06,158 --> 00:15:08,147
That's why I plan to get his consent first.

270
00:15:08,827 --> 00:15:11,638
Whether or not I can tell the child about him if the child asks.

271
00:15:11,638 --> 00:15:14,988
If he's willing to meet the child if the child...

272
00:15:15,638 --> 00:15:17,287
wants to meet him.

273
00:15:19,308 --> 00:15:20,787
To the donor?

274
00:15:21,908 --> 00:15:23,157
Yes.

275
00:15:25,347 --> 00:15:29,318
But first, I'd have to explain it to the child...

276
00:15:29,318 --> 00:15:30,897
so he or she understands.

277
00:15:33,388 --> 00:15:37,108
"Mommy wanted to meet you so badly,"

278
00:15:37,428 --> 00:15:40,007
"that I asked a kind man for help."

279
00:15:41,497 --> 00:15:43,697
"But just because he gave you life..."

280
00:15:43,697 --> 00:15:45,618
"doesn't make him your dad."

281
00:15:46,597 --> 00:15:48,688
"Not because he doesn't love you,"

282
00:15:49,538 --> 00:15:51,988
"but because he and Mommy don't love each other."

283
00:15:52,178 --> 00:15:53,858
"That's why."

284
00:15:59,477 --> 00:16:01,767
I know for sure I can love my baby,

285
00:16:05,888 --> 00:16:07,938
but the baby will want more, right?

286
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,708
I'm sure your child...

287
00:16:16,497 --> 00:16:19,448
will be lucky to have you for a mom.

288
00:16:25,438 --> 00:16:26,558
Thank you.

289
00:16:31,717 --> 00:16:32,968
So...

290
00:16:35,888 --> 00:16:37,637
the biological dad...

291
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:42,608
needs to have healthy genes...

292
00:16:42,758 --> 00:16:43,938
Exactly.

293
00:16:44,258 --> 00:16:46,608
How do you find out?

294
00:16:51,097 --> 00:16:52,247
So...

295
00:16:56,068 --> 00:16:59,127
You must be done with the proposal if you're hanging out here.

296
00:17:02,008 --> 00:17:03,997
And you didn't get your physical, did you?

297
00:17:04,077 --> 00:17:05,697
You have to get it this week.

298
00:17:06,778 --> 00:17:08,147
Yes, sir.

299
00:17:08,147 --> 00:17:09,298
Me too.

300
00:17:12,488 --> 00:17:13,808
I need to get mine too.

301
00:17:17,687 --> 00:17:18,808
I will.

302
00:17:26,498 --> 00:17:28,217
- Are you leaving? - Yes.

303
00:17:37,048 --> 00:17:38,167
Hey.

304
00:17:38,647 --> 00:17:39,967
What?

305
00:17:40,748 --> 00:17:41,798
What is it?

306
00:17:48,528 --> 00:17:49,677
Shall we?

307
00:17:50,387 --> 00:17:51,808
What do you want?

308
00:17:52,857 --> 00:17:54,108
That hits the spot.

309
00:17:56,268 --> 00:17:57,947
Are you not over In Ah?

310
00:17:59,798 --> 00:18:02,367
How do you ask that without even a warning?

311
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,917
I wondered...

312
00:18:03,937 --> 00:18:07,358
if that was why you can't date someone even if you like her.

313
00:18:07,877 --> 00:18:09,798
I'm not dating because it's comfortable being alone.

314
00:18:10,778 --> 00:18:12,877
To be honest, you envy me.

315
00:18:12,877 --> 00:18:14,167
Like crazy.

316
00:18:17,988 --> 00:18:20,568
I worried a lot about you two.

317
00:18:21,387 --> 00:18:24,758
During the retreat during your freshman year in college,

318
00:18:24,758 --> 00:18:27,977
when we went to Daeseong-ri, you two sneaked out...

319
00:18:27,998 --> 00:18:29,977
and I caught you kissing.

320
00:18:31,538 --> 00:18:34,348
I watched you guys for 17 years since.

321
00:18:35,837 --> 00:18:37,917
You have an incredible memory.

322
00:18:38,278 --> 00:18:42,558
You two were doing so well without a hitch but suddenly broke up.

323
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:45,467
I felt terrible.

324
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:49,386
You were so hurt at the time,

325
00:18:49,387 --> 00:18:51,237
that I couldn't ask.

326
00:18:52,988 --> 00:18:54,407
Why did you break up?

327
00:19:13,808 --> 00:19:15,127
Why is it here again?

328
00:19:16,377 --> 00:19:18,058
Can't you put it somewhere convenient?

329
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:29,578
In Ah.

330
00:19:31,258 --> 00:19:32,848
That was there the whole time.

331
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:39,387
Nothing changed.

332
00:19:42,038 --> 00:19:43,318
Not a thing.

333
00:19:45,478 --> 00:19:46,687
What?

334
00:19:51,308 --> 00:19:52,768
Everything changed.

335
00:19:53,347 --> 00:19:55,967
We fought about the littlest things.

336
00:19:57,318 --> 00:20:00,637
We started to hate even the habits that we liked.

337
00:20:02,387 --> 00:20:05,477
Well... We just got tired of it.

338
00:20:07,427 --> 00:20:09,377
Are you afraid it'll happen again?

339
00:20:10,867 --> 00:20:12,217
Is that why you want to live alone?

340
00:20:13,798 --> 00:20:17,558
Try to meet a nice person. It may be different.

341
00:20:20,837 --> 00:20:22,058
Soo Chul.

342
00:20:23,177 --> 00:20:26,328
Even the person I loved for 17 years couldn't do it.

343
00:20:27,417 --> 00:20:30,467
Why would I make a nice person deal with my problems?

344
00:20:31,248 --> 00:20:32,538
I'll just deal with it alone.

345
00:20:38,058 --> 00:20:39,407
I'm drunk.

346
00:20:50,038 --> 00:20:52,957
There is no way the love will...

347
00:20:57,407 --> 00:20:58,528
I Sang!

348
00:21:03,087 --> 00:21:04,397
You saw me, didn't you?

349
00:21:06,758 --> 00:21:07,868
I did.

350
00:21:09,087 --> 00:21:11,038
Did you just ignore me?

351
00:21:12,498 --> 00:21:14,248
Yes, that's right.

352
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:15,917
Why?

353
00:21:16,597 --> 00:21:18,487
Can't I do as I please?

354
00:21:21,968 --> 00:21:23,157
You're drunk.

355
00:21:25,337 --> 00:21:26,687
Yes.

356
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:28,798
Correct.

357
00:21:30,508 --> 00:21:31,927
Oh my gosh.

358
00:21:32,677 --> 00:21:34,397
That's so funny.

359
00:21:35,117 --> 00:21:36,338
My goodness.

360
00:21:52,637 --> 00:21:54,147
Why are you following me?

361
00:21:57,208 --> 00:21:58,858
Because the park is round.

362
00:21:59,137 --> 00:22:00,828
So is Earth.

363
00:22:01,077 --> 00:22:04,498
The Earth is round, so if we keep walking, we'll meet.

364
00:22:07,718 --> 00:22:10,568
- You're drunk. - Don't underestimate my tolerance.

365
00:22:11,087 --> 00:22:12,768
Drunk I Sang.

366
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:14,937
Can you find your way home okay?

367
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:19,207
What do you take me for?

368
00:22:25,397 --> 00:22:26,618
So...

369
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:30,387
what did I do to deserve the "Good Job" stamp?

370
00:22:32,177 --> 00:22:34,187
- What? - I mean...

371
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:38,417
Be more specific. What exactly did I do...

372
00:22:38,417 --> 00:22:40,927
to receive a compliment?

373
00:22:43,847 --> 00:22:45,167
I Sang.

374
00:22:46,958 --> 00:22:48,237
You're tall...

375
00:22:48,687 --> 00:22:49,977
and handsome.

376
00:22:50,788 --> 00:22:53,508
And you have a good personality.

377
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:00,118
I'm 41 years old.

378
00:23:00,367 --> 00:23:01,687
I'm not a little kid.

379
00:23:01,907 --> 00:23:03,457
You become funny when you're drunk.

380
00:23:05,137 --> 00:23:06,627
Why don't we drink together?

381
00:23:07,407 --> 00:23:08,697
I want to enjoy this a bit more.

382
00:23:12,778 --> 00:23:13,897
No?

383
00:23:15,687 --> 00:23:16,838
Today,

384
00:23:17,788 --> 00:23:20,538
I need to be alone.

385
00:23:23,587 --> 00:23:24,737
If I stay with you,

386
00:23:28,228 --> 00:23:29,377
something bad might happen.

387
00:23:32,268 --> 00:23:33,917
You don't scare me anymore.

388
00:23:35,337 --> 00:23:36,457
I'll see you.

389
00:23:37,538 --> 00:23:38,657
Bye.

390
00:23:49,548 --> 00:23:51,768
Hello. Her name is Do Ah.

391
00:23:52,058 --> 00:23:53,707
Hi, Do Ah.

392
00:23:54,357 --> 00:23:55,508
- Careful. - Okay.

393
00:23:55,758 --> 00:23:58,437
I'll see you later. Have fun with your teacher, okay?

394
00:23:58,528 --> 00:24:02,048
If you're worried, you can stay and watch since it's her first day.

395
00:24:03,597 --> 00:24:06,348
No, it's okay. We'll have to do this every day from now on.

396
00:24:06,437 --> 00:24:08,217
So she needs to learn to accept that.

397
00:24:09,208 --> 00:24:11,657
Do Ah, don't cry, and be a good girl, okay?

398
00:24:56,988 --> 00:24:58,137
Look!

399
00:24:59,958 --> 00:25:01,137
Do Ah.

400
00:25:04,488 --> 00:25:06,377
She's having fun without me.

401
00:25:07,357 --> 00:25:09,518
Yes, good. What about this one?

402
00:25:10,268 --> 00:25:13,748
I'm glad she's being a good girl, but I do feel a little sad.

403
00:25:56,008 --> 00:25:58,667
- Move it to the left! - Okay.

404
00:25:59,048 --> 00:26:00,528
Move it a bit more.

405
00:26:02,117 --> 00:26:03,237
It looks nice.

406
00:26:14,758 --> 00:26:15,877
Do you think she's doing okay?

407
00:26:17,028 --> 00:26:19,618
- Pardon? - My daughter, Do Ah.

408
00:26:26,077 --> 00:26:27,407
(Resume)

409
00:26:27,407 --> 00:26:29,727
- Ms. Moon Oh Bin? - Yes.

410
00:26:29,907 --> 00:26:32,998
Gosh, you worked at this hospital for a very long time.

411
00:26:33,248 --> 00:26:36,248
Yes, I had to quit because the doctor...

412
00:26:36,248 --> 00:26:37,998
ended up emigrating abroad.

413
00:26:38,087 --> 00:26:39,237
Oh, dear.

414
00:26:39,617 --> 00:26:42,387
I'm going to work here until the day I die.

415
00:26:42,387 --> 00:26:43,778
So you don't need to worry about retirement.

416
00:26:44,927 --> 00:26:46,048
I see.

417
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:49,018
But I have a question.

418
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:53,318
Do I also need to take care of your baby?

419
00:26:55,097 --> 00:26:58,487
I raise my kid with the help of technology.

420
00:26:59,337 --> 00:27:00,487
Ta-da.

421
00:27:02,347 --> 00:27:03,457
My goodness.

422
00:27:05,347 --> 00:27:08,068
So you don't need to take care of her.

423
00:27:09,847 --> 00:27:13,157
And once things settle, I'll have her stay at the daycare center.

424
00:27:13,157 --> 00:27:14,467
I plan to take care of her until then.

425
00:27:15,657 --> 00:27:17,578
She doesn't like saying goodbye, does she?

426
00:27:20,698 --> 00:27:21,848
No, it's not that.

427
00:27:23,568 --> 00:27:25,217
I'm the one who can't seem to adjust.

428
00:27:26,468 --> 00:27:27,618
Pardon?

429
00:27:30,268 --> 00:27:31,387
It's no problem.

430
00:27:32,778 --> 00:27:35,088
Gosh, there are so many things to fill out.

431
00:27:36,548 --> 00:27:39,117
I've never gotten a checkup before.

432
00:27:39,117 --> 00:27:41,227
I also had my first checkup after I started working here.

433
00:27:41,847 --> 00:27:43,637
Are you just going to take the basic test?

434
00:27:43,788 --> 00:27:46,038
No, I'm going to check everything.

435
00:27:46,958 --> 00:27:49,338
Excuse me. Can you help me?

436
00:27:51,488 --> 00:27:53,677
What are the extra tests I can take?

437
00:27:54,258 --> 00:27:56,998
If you look here, you can check your brain, heart,

438
00:27:56,998 --> 00:27:58,818
and there's also a male checkup.

439
00:27:58,867 --> 00:28:01,588
Take a look at the list and check the ones you want to get tested.

440
00:28:01,897 --> 00:28:03,468
- Okay, thank you. - Sure.

441
00:28:03,468 --> 00:28:04,588
- Thank you. - No problem.

442
00:28:07,038 --> 00:28:08,727
You should get everything tested.

443
00:28:09,478 --> 00:28:11,427
- Everything? - But there's too many.

444
00:28:12,647 --> 00:28:13,718
Just do it while you're here.

445
00:28:13,718 --> 00:28:14,778
(Gastroscopy, Carotid ultrasound,)

446
00:28:14,778 --> 00:28:15,868
(Echocardiography, Physical strength...)

447
00:28:22,228 --> 00:28:23,677
- Ms. Jang. - Yes?

448
00:28:32,597 --> 00:28:34,088
Hey, hey!

449
00:28:39,238 --> 00:28:40,328
You're all done.

450
00:28:40,437 --> 00:28:42,457
I bet you didn't know she drew your blood because it hurt too much.

451
00:28:45,778 --> 00:28:47,467
But my cheek hurts as well.

452
00:28:49,347 --> 00:28:50,868
Hey, you punk.

453
00:28:52,218 --> 00:28:54,838
What do you think you're doing?

454
00:28:56,587 --> 00:29:00,078
I'm here, you darn jerk.

455
00:29:00,627 --> 00:29:01,947
You fool.

456
00:29:05,768 --> 00:29:09,018
Stop being such a crybaby.

457
00:29:10,837 --> 00:29:12,558
You darn punk.

458
00:29:13,377 --> 00:29:15,187
Mind your own business.

459
00:29:19,177 --> 00:29:21,028
Sperm donation.

460
00:29:23,718 --> 00:29:26,108
- Eu Ddeum, are you okay? - Sperm donation.

461
00:29:29,288 --> 00:29:31,907
What about sperm donation.

462
00:29:33,298 --> 00:29:34,907
It gives hope to couples...

463
00:29:37,998 --> 00:29:39,748
who can't have babies.

464
00:29:41,167 --> 00:29:42,318
My goodness.

465
00:29:46,377 --> 00:29:48,558
I'm kind of nervous about the checkup.

466
00:29:49,107 --> 00:29:50,558
I hope there's nothing wrong with me.

467
00:29:51,008 --> 00:29:52,948
I know we can't ever be sure about your health,

468
00:29:52,948 --> 00:29:54,577
but I bet you're fine.

469
00:29:54,577 --> 00:29:56,137
You could even swallow a stone and you will still be fine.

470
00:29:56,748 --> 00:30:00,437
Once you get the results, will you let me know...

471
00:30:00,558 --> 00:30:02,137
regardless of how good or bad it is?

472
00:30:02,857 --> 00:30:04,308
I'm just worried. That's all.

473
00:30:06,198 --> 00:30:08,048
Sure. I promise I'll tell you.

474
00:30:08,798 --> 00:30:10,518
- You promise? - Yes, I promise.

475
00:30:27,077 --> 00:30:28,467
Ms. Jang!

476
00:30:30,288 --> 00:30:32,508
Everything is normal. I'm really healthy.

477
00:30:32,587 --> 00:30:33,868
I knew it.

478
00:30:34,087 --> 00:30:35,808
And I have something to brag about.

479
00:30:35,827 --> 00:30:38,877
Even the doctor was shocked. He told me this is very rare.

480
00:30:39,857 --> 00:30:42,248
I have 10 times more than the average man.

481
00:30:43,028 --> 00:30:44,097
What are you talking about?

482
00:30:44,097 --> 00:30:45,687
The number of sperm!

483
00:30:50,738 --> 00:30:54,288
(Choi Kang Eu Ddeum)

484
00:31:08,802 --> 00:31:10,062
10 times? My gosh.

485
00:31:10,473 --> 00:31:12,763
What are you going to do with all that sperm?

486
00:31:13,483 --> 00:31:15,233
I didn't expect this either.

487
00:31:15,383 --> 00:31:16,463
So I don't know.

488
00:31:18,552 --> 00:31:20,173
As you know,

489
00:31:20,653 --> 00:31:24,102
we've been doing some research regarding sperm donation.

490
00:31:24,123 --> 00:31:25,973
Oh, right. Sperm donation.

491
00:31:26,522 --> 00:31:27,642
Exactly.

492
00:31:32,532 --> 00:31:33,983
Should I share it with the boss?

493
00:31:38,332 --> 00:31:39,523
Really?

494
00:31:39,973 --> 00:31:42,312
It's not easy to do if you think about it,

495
00:31:42,312 --> 00:31:44,622
but it's also not that difficult.

496
00:31:44,913 --> 00:31:47,832
Comparing it to blood donation might be a stretch,

497
00:31:48,042 --> 00:31:51,102
but it could be done if it's about helping...

498
00:31:51,883 --> 00:31:52,973
one's wish come true.

499
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:55,183
The donor will stay anonymous,

500
00:31:55,183 --> 00:31:57,043
so it'll be like doing a good deed in secret.

501
00:31:58,292 --> 00:32:00,112
Still, it's not something...

502
00:32:00,463 --> 00:32:02,683
you should easily decide.

503
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:05,283
I don't have to be a father to the kid,

504
00:32:05,933 --> 00:32:07,753
so consider it as my good deed.

505
00:32:08,832 --> 00:32:11,223
I'm grateful for the offer,

506
00:32:11,403 --> 00:32:13,052
but think about it some more.

507
00:32:13,542 --> 00:32:17,122
It could become a problem when you get married later on.

508
00:32:18,173 --> 00:32:20,443
You might even date someone...

509
00:32:20,443 --> 00:32:22,533
- when I'm pregnant. - Don't you worry.

510
00:32:23,252 --> 00:32:24,763
I don't know about my future wife,

511
00:32:25,683 --> 00:32:27,252
but I'll seek approval from my parents.

512
00:32:27,252 --> 00:32:28,533
What?

513
00:32:29,453 --> 00:32:30,703
Your parents?

514
00:32:31,123 --> 00:32:33,273
I'll be fathering a kid I won't have custody of.

515
00:32:33,522 --> 00:32:34,872
My parents should know.

516
00:32:35,123 --> 00:32:37,292
Right, I guess they should.

517
00:32:37,292 --> 00:32:38,642
Of course.

518
00:32:38,832 --> 00:32:41,513
They'll be having a grandchild they won't know about.

519
00:32:43,373 --> 00:32:45,993
Then they'll be quite shocked.

520
00:32:46,903 --> 00:32:50,162
Exactly. I shouldn't be a part of the kid's life,

521
00:32:50,413 --> 00:32:52,592
so I should ask if my parents could...

522
00:32:53,183 --> 00:32:54,332
forget about the kid too.

523
00:32:57,153 --> 00:32:59,372
- I'll head back inside then. - Sure.

524
00:33:05,123 --> 00:33:06,372
This won't be easy.

525
00:33:14,032 --> 00:33:15,153
Yes, Auntie.

526
00:33:17,973 --> 00:33:21,622
Wait, hold on. Please calm down first.

527
00:33:22,773 --> 00:33:25,863
Please head to the ER and I'll be right there.

528
00:33:26,112 --> 00:33:27,262
Thanks.

529
00:33:39,922 --> 00:33:42,273
Ms. Shim, Mr. Joo is asking for you.

530
00:33:46,333 --> 00:33:47,602
Got it.

531
00:33:47,603 --> 00:33:49,012
(Dachae Media Sales Report)

532
00:33:54,703 --> 00:33:56,262
Only "The Baby"...

533
00:33:57,012 --> 00:33:58,863
reported a down in sales.

534
00:34:00,842 --> 00:34:04,133
You see, the industry is in recession...

535
00:34:05,882 --> 00:34:08,032
(Hubby: The result for our baby is out.)

536
00:34:12,293 --> 00:34:14,742
- Ms. Shim. - Yes?

537
00:34:15,063 --> 00:34:16,983
Now that you're back from your maternity leave,

538
00:34:16,993 --> 00:34:19,153
I'd like you to focus on your department's sales.

539
00:34:19,563 --> 00:34:20,802
It's been doing the worst for the past three years...

540
00:34:20,802 --> 00:34:23,053
and you've been losing your advertisement deals.

541
00:34:23,302 --> 00:34:26,153
Shouldn't you feel responsible?

542
00:34:26,243 --> 00:34:28,572
The journalists and I have been proposing advertisement deals...

543
00:34:28,572 --> 00:34:30,312
just as much as the Advertising Department.

544
00:34:30,313 --> 00:34:32,543
I didn't even take time off to care for my child longer.

545
00:34:32,543 --> 00:34:33,932
You should...

546
00:34:36,112 --> 00:34:37,633
if you're sure you'll be back.

547
00:34:38,512 --> 00:34:41,133
Child-rearing doesn't end with just three months,

548
00:34:41,583 --> 00:34:45,472
so if you don't come back after taking all that time off,

549
00:34:45,762 --> 00:34:47,943
you'll only be costing the company money.

550
00:34:48,293 --> 00:34:51,132
I know, sir. It's why I didn't take time off...

551
00:34:51,132 --> 00:34:52,753
even though I'm entitled to.

552
00:34:53,203 --> 00:34:54,553
You keep suggesting I shouldn't.

553
00:34:57,873 --> 00:35:00,703
Sir, no matter how hard we work,

554
00:35:00,703 --> 00:35:04,043
we can't do anything about the low birthrate or...

555
00:35:04,043 --> 00:35:05,363
Fine.

556
00:35:07,683 --> 00:35:09,162
Anyway,

557
00:35:09,382 --> 00:35:11,733
we were asked to advertise Mureung City.

558
00:35:12,523 --> 00:35:14,133
"The Baby" should take it.

559
00:35:14,652 --> 00:35:16,753
It was originally meant for "The Deco",

560
00:35:16,753 --> 00:35:19,223
but I'm only giving it to you to boost your sales,

561
00:35:19,223 --> 00:35:21,372
so do a good job on it.

562
00:35:21,922 --> 00:35:24,943
If Mureung City is pleased with the outcome,

563
00:35:25,092 --> 00:35:27,713
all the projects from local governments...

564
00:35:28,362 --> 00:35:30,883
will be turned over to "The Baby".

565
00:35:33,103 --> 00:35:35,423
Mr. Joo, my gosh. You were...

566
00:35:35,603 --> 00:35:38,423
only being hard on us to offer us this deal,

567
00:35:38,572 --> 00:35:40,332
but we were too stupid...

568
00:35:40,683 --> 00:35:42,363
to read into your intentions.

569
00:35:42,652 --> 00:35:43,733
Thank you, sir.

570
00:35:46,183 --> 00:35:48,432
It's why being in this position can get lonely.

571
00:35:57,232 --> 00:36:00,553
Seriously? What are you doing here? Go home and have fun.

572
00:36:02,103 --> 00:36:03,852
I don't feel comfortable doing so.

573
00:36:03,973 --> 00:36:05,232
That's your punishment.

574
00:36:05,232 --> 00:36:08,053
I'd rather have fun here while being uncomfortable.

575
00:36:11,273 --> 00:36:14,813
The City of Mureung has asked us to run an advertisement piece.

576
00:36:14,813 --> 00:36:17,183
You'll take the plane there and gather notes for a day.

577
00:36:17,183 --> 00:36:19,012
Other media outlets will be there,

578
00:36:19,012 --> 00:36:22,083
so make sure you come up with a piece...

579
00:36:22,083 --> 00:36:25,543
that blows the minds of the people of Mureung City.

580
00:36:26,123 --> 00:36:27,242
Who wants to go?

581
00:36:29,833 --> 00:36:32,443
My gosh. I covered 15 stories this month.

582
00:36:32,663 --> 00:36:35,203
Well, I'm going to Gangwon Province...

583
00:36:35,203 --> 00:36:36,753
to run a piece on the wholesale warehouse.

584
00:36:36,833 --> 00:36:40,452
Actually, I'd like to ask what our plans are for...

585
00:36:40,603 --> 00:36:42,193
the readers of our first issue.

586
00:36:53,422 --> 00:36:55,583
Ha Ri is terrified to fly.

587
00:36:55,583 --> 00:36:58,673
Exactly. Besides, how can she go when she's been suspended?

588
00:36:58,953 --> 00:37:01,312
She can't since she's out having fun.

589
00:37:07,203 --> 00:37:09,883
Since I've been suspended, I'll write this piece.

590
00:37:12,273 --> 00:37:13,722
I can't go.

591
00:37:14,572 --> 00:37:15,892
Why not?

592
00:37:16,012 --> 00:37:18,863
I made a drunken mistake in front of Ms. Jang.

593
00:37:21,782 --> 00:37:23,133
No way.

594
00:37:25,982 --> 00:37:27,273
You showed her your cute side?

595
00:37:36,592 --> 00:37:37,713
You idiot!

596
00:37:38,793 --> 00:37:41,653
How can you look Ms. Jang in the eyes now?

597
00:37:44,473 --> 00:37:46,492
The embarrassment might just kill me,

598
00:37:47,302 --> 00:37:48,753
but I'll try and hang in there.

599
00:37:49,143 --> 00:37:51,392
The photos are important for this piece...

600
00:37:51,612 --> 00:37:53,942
so they need an expert photographer,

601
00:37:53,942 --> 00:37:55,562
but I busted my arm.

602
00:37:55,782 --> 00:37:58,062
I can't bring in the money with a busted arm...

603
00:37:58,282 --> 00:37:59,803
which means I can't hire a freelancer.

604
00:38:00,023 --> 00:38:01,303
Unbelievable.

605
00:38:01,583 --> 00:38:04,293
- I'll have to give up the studio. - That's enough.

606
00:38:04,293 --> 00:38:06,113
I can't look Ms. Jang in the eyes anymore.

607
00:38:08,092 --> 00:38:09,443
This is all on you now!

608
00:38:16,373 --> 00:38:19,622
Mr. Nam, the photographer hasn't contacted me yet.

609
00:38:19,842 --> 00:38:21,492
Don't tell me you still haven't hired one.

610
00:38:21,503 --> 00:38:23,193
He'll be there somewhere.

611
00:38:23,373 --> 00:38:25,992
He's your partner, so look around.

612
00:38:26,683 --> 00:38:28,793
What? My partner?

613
00:38:29,282 --> 00:38:30,332
What the...

614
00:38:35,183 --> 00:38:36,403
I found him.

615
00:38:55,273 --> 00:38:56,423
Shall we?

616
00:38:56,773 --> 00:38:59,693
Why didn't you call to say you were joining me?

617
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:01,733
We could've carpooled.

618
00:39:02,853 --> 00:39:04,932
- Do you want this? - No.

619
00:39:06,183 --> 00:39:08,872
How about buttered squid or beef jerky?

620
00:39:09,023 --> 00:39:10,242
I'm good.

621
00:39:12,192 --> 00:39:14,173
How about we grab a drink afterward?

622
00:39:14,223 --> 00:39:16,943
I like how alcohol makes you cute and sincere.

623
00:39:16,962 --> 00:39:18,443
Can't I do as I please?

624
00:39:18,732 --> 00:39:20,063
Yes.

625
00:39:20,063 --> 00:39:21,682
Correct.

626
00:39:24,072 --> 00:39:25,222
This isn't a vacation, you know.

627
00:39:25,632 --> 00:39:27,553
But it's still a trip.

628
00:39:27,773 --> 00:39:30,823
What's so bad about buying snacks and getting in the mood?

629
00:39:31,413 --> 00:39:32,722
We're even getting on a plane.

630
00:39:34,913 --> 00:39:36,963
Unbelievable. I hate planes.

631
00:39:41,123 --> 00:39:43,893
But we're not going...

632
00:39:43,893 --> 00:39:46,142
on a vacation though.

633
00:39:46,393 --> 00:39:48,673
So you don't want any snacks?

634
00:39:54,462 --> 00:39:56,082
Isn't that a bit too much?

635
00:40:03,842 --> 00:40:05,863
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

636
00:40:06,382 --> 00:40:09,032
We welcome you on our flight.

637
00:40:09,482 --> 00:40:12,482
The flight attendants are here to make sure you have...

638
00:40:12,482 --> 00:40:14,073
- a safe journey. - Are you all right?

639
00:40:15,123 --> 00:40:17,993
I just get nervous before the plane takes off.

640
00:40:17,993 --> 00:40:20,173
I'll be fine once we're in the air.

641
00:40:22,262 --> 00:40:24,032
You're not sick or anything, right?

642
00:40:24,032 --> 00:40:25,032
- I'm good. - Thank you for...

643
00:40:25,032 --> 00:40:28,253
your cooperation and we hope...

644
00:41:36,302 --> 00:41:37,433
Hello.

645
00:41:37,433 --> 00:41:39,023
- Hello. - Hello.

646
00:41:42,743 --> 00:41:44,923
Did Ha Ri not come with you?

647
00:41:44,942 --> 00:41:47,793
Ha Ri went on a business trip to Mureung City with Mr. Han.

648
00:41:48,913 --> 00:41:51,432
To that very far city of Mureung...

649
00:41:51,612 --> 00:41:55,202
alone with Mr. Han, with no other staff members.

650
00:41:58,623 --> 00:41:59,812
They went together.

651
00:42:01,862 --> 00:42:04,543
What are they doing there, that they went...

652
00:42:05,192 --> 00:42:06,312
by themselves?

653
00:42:06,962 --> 00:42:09,682
What a load of crock.

654
00:42:13,302 --> 00:42:16,793
Ladies and gentlemen, the pilot has turned off the seat belt sign.

655
00:42:17,143 --> 00:42:20,183
However, because there may be turbulence,

656
00:42:20,183 --> 00:42:23,133
please keep your seat belts on when you are seated.

657
00:42:23,813 --> 00:42:26,112
When the seat belt light is on,

658
00:42:26,112 --> 00:42:29,773
we will not be serving food and beverages for safety reasons.

659
00:42:31,192 --> 00:42:32,943
- Oh dear. - Oh my gosh.

660
00:42:33,192 --> 00:42:34,843
Are you okay, sir?

661
00:43:27,782 --> 00:43:29,932
Maybe he could be the one...

662
00:43:31,083 --> 00:43:32,202
Is it him?

663
00:43:33,223 --> 00:43:34,673
The bus that I missed.

664
00:43:36,493 --> 00:43:37,602
This always happens.

665
00:43:37,692 --> 00:43:39,173
Especially when I'm late for an important appointment,

666
00:43:39,223 --> 00:43:41,173
the bus won't show up.

667
00:43:41,922 --> 00:43:45,312
If I hop in a cab to save time, we get stuck in traffic,

668
00:43:45,632 --> 00:43:48,063
and the bus I was waiting for...

669
00:43:48,063 --> 00:43:50,282
speeds along in the bus express lane.

670
00:43:51,433 --> 00:43:53,442
If my impatience took control,

671
00:43:53,442 --> 00:43:55,892
and made me miss a destined meeting,

672
00:43:57,572 --> 00:43:58,793
will I...

673
00:43:59,913 --> 00:44:03,233
regret not holding his hand later on?

674
00:44:18,592 --> 00:44:21,912
Why won't this open?

675
00:44:22,532 --> 00:44:23,722
Gosh.

676
00:44:25,402 --> 00:44:26,622
It opened easily.

677
00:44:27,072 --> 00:44:28,892
They made it well. You know...

678
00:44:30,072 --> 00:44:32,722
- Do you want this? - No.

679
00:44:33,183 --> 00:44:34,293
Okay.

680
00:44:37,453 --> 00:44:38,733
Sir.

681
00:44:42,953 --> 00:44:44,102
Thank you.

682
00:44:47,163 --> 00:44:50,082
I was giving you my handkerchief, not my hand.

683
00:44:51,132 --> 00:44:53,912
Yes, handkerchief.

684
00:45:03,072 --> 00:45:04,562
- What? - Hey, Ha Ri.

685
00:45:04,813 --> 00:45:06,992
Should I keep my lab coat on or take it off?

686
00:45:07,842 --> 00:45:09,662
Why are you asking me about you taking clothes off?

687
00:45:11,012 --> 00:45:13,273
- Ask the reporter there. - What?

688
00:45:13,982 --> 00:45:15,303
Both look good?

689
00:45:15,322 --> 00:45:17,303
Stop joking around. You're embarrassing me.

690
00:45:17,523 --> 00:45:20,023
Okay. Should I take the pictures with or without?

691
00:45:20,023 --> 00:45:21,843
Take it off if you want. I don't care.

692
00:45:22,793 --> 00:45:23,912
Gosh.

693
00:45:24,592 --> 00:45:26,043
It's better with it on?

694
00:45:26,333 --> 00:45:28,553
Okay, got it. Work hard.

695
00:45:29,563 --> 00:45:30,952
She says I look good with it on.

696
00:45:31,032 --> 00:45:32,753
Okay.

697
00:45:34,243 --> 00:45:35,352
Gosh.

698
00:45:37,712 --> 00:45:40,233
- Was that Dr. Yoon Jae Young? - Yes.

699
00:45:45,853 --> 00:45:47,133
What is it this time?

700
00:45:47,183 --> 00:45:49,573
Should I sit or stand for the picture?

701
00:45:49,993 --> 00:45:53,262
It would be better standing by the window looking cool. right?

702
00:45:53,262 --> 00:45:56,582
It'll bet better seated at my desk so that my nameplate shows.

703
00:45:57,732 --> 00:45:59,113
Sit for the photo...

704
00:45:59,362 --> 00:46:00,553
and cover your gut.

705
00:46:03,873 --> 00:46:06,852
Sure, got it. Okay. Work hard.

706
00:46:09,743 --> 00:46:10,892
Let's start.

707
00:46:18,012 --> 00:46:19,652
What? Why? What? What?

708
00:46:19,652 --> 00:46:21,782
Should I smile or not?

709
00:46:21,782 --> 00:46:23,353
It's best not smiling, right?

710
00:46:23,353 --> 00:46:25,742
To look serious and professional.

711
00:46:25,993 --> 00:46:27,793
No. Smiling may be better.

712
00:46:27,793 --> 00:46:29,362
This is a local hospital.

713
00:46:29,362 --> 00:46:32,213
So it'll be better to look friendly.

714
00:46:32,362 --> 00:46:34,983
Just shut your trap and take the picture, you punk.

715
00:46:40,172 --> 00:46:41,243
Okay.

716
00:46:41,243 --> 00:46:43,622
I look great both ways? What?

717
00:46:43,973 --> 00:46:45,823
Enough, Ha Ri.

718
00:46:52,482 --> 00:46:53,633
Doctor.

719
00:46:55,583 --> 00:46:57,273
It'll be this big.

720
00:46:59,253 --> 00:47:01,073
(My child whines if I don't let her watch on my smartphone.)

721
00:47:03,333 --> 00:47:04,512
That won't be easy.

722
00:47:05,893 --> 00:47:08,462
Mureung is named that because there are no royal tombs.

723
00:47:08,462 --> 00:47:10,622
In order to hide the location of the kings' graves,

724
00:47:10,902 --> 00:47:13,072
they built fake graves here.

725
00:47:13,072 --> 00:47:15,693
There is a legend that a dragon rose from there.

726
00:47:15,873 --> 00:47:18,062
So the saying goes.

727
00:47:19,143 --> 00:47:21,262
- Take all the pictures you want. - Thank you.

728
00:47:24,612 --> 00:47:25,903
Should I take some that way?

729
00:47:27,353 --> 00:47:28,403
I think it'll look good.

730
00:47:30,052 --> 00:47:31,202
Here.

731
00:47:31,453 --> 00:47:32,573
Excuse me.

732
00:47:56,953 --> 00:47:58,162
- Okay, good. - Good?

733
00:48:00,322 --> 00:48:01,472
Shall we go?

734
00:48:04,493 --> 00:48:08,362
Okay. The official schedule for the day is over.

735
00:48:08,362 --> 00:48:10,182
Feel free to take more pictures.

736
00:48:10,333 --> 00:48:13,012
If you want to hang out more, feel free to do that as well.

737
00:48:13,192 --> 00:48:14,862
Thank you, everyone.

738
00:48:14,862 --> 00:48:16,082
- Thank you. - Sure.

739
00:48:19,402 --> 00:48:22,852
Ha Ri. Don't you think we need something better for the main shot?

740
00:48:23,003 --> 00:48:26,093
Right? Should we take some pictures of the sunset?

741
00:48:32,853 --> 00:48:34,633
Is Ha Ri not back yet?

742
00:48:34,953 --> 00:48:37,303
She went to Mureung. She'll probably be home late.

743
00:48:37,322 --> 00:48:39,003
- Come eat. - Auntie.

744
00:48:39,393 --> 00:48:40,713
The photographer is a man.

745
00:48:40,762 --> 00:48:42,812
What if something happens while they're alone together?

746
00:48:43,862 --> 00:48:45,012
Like what?

747
00:48:46,563 --> 00:48:47,782
Something frightening.

748
00:48:55,143 --> 00:48:58,892
I wonder if we needed to rent a car just to go take one picture.

749
00:48:59,612 --> 00:49:01,693
You said your pride is on the line.

750
00:49:02,643 --> 00:49:04,162
It'll say, "Photo by Han I Sang."

751
00:49:04,712 --> 00:49:06,202
So my pride is on the line too.

752
00:49:07,152 --> 00:49:08,472
Even if I did refuse to do this,

753
00:49:08,623 --> 00:49:10,742
I've never given less than 100 percent.

754
00:49:12,953 --> 00:49:14,113
I know.

755
00:49:16,362 --> 00:49:17,943
Will we have enough time?

756
00:49:22,732 --> 00:49:24,883
We can make our flight if we rush.

757
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:26,622
Okay.

758
00:50:04,873 --> 00:50:07,693
How about this for your explanation of Mureung City?

759
00:50:17,123 --> 00:50:18,273
What?

760
00:50:19,552 --> 00:50:22,412
You're the first photographer to takes pictures...

761
00:50:23,123 --> 00:50:24,582
with the article in mind.

762
00:50:28,762 --> 00:50:29,883
It's perfect.

763
00:50:32,802 --> 00:50:35,193
- Should we take a few more? - Okay.

764
00:50:37,273 --> 00:50:39,463
She went there for work. What could possibly happen?

765
00:50:39,572 --> 00:50:43,363
She went on multi-day business trips with men, and nothing happened.

766
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:45,403
What if something happens this time?

767
00:50:45,953 --> 00:50:48,303
You've heard of incidents like that.

768
00:50:48,552 --> 00:50:50,702
You work like crazy and miss the train.

769
00:50:50,853 --> 00:50:53,202
You look for a place to stay, and there's only one.

770
00:50:53,322 --> 00:50:56,512
Furthermore, they have one vacant room.

771
00:50:57,333 --> 00:51:00,753
I hate these cliche and offensive things...

772
00:51:01,232 --> 00:51:02,402
so much.

773
00:51:02,402 --> 00:51:05,983
Why couldn't she come home just because there's no train?

774
00:51:06,632 --> 00:51:09,693
- Right? - Unless there is a rainstorm...

775
00:51:09,902 --> 00:51:11,093
What?

776
00:51:17,753 --> 00:51:18,963
It looks like rain.

777
00:51:19,512 --> 00:51:20,673
Rain?

778
00:51:23,223 --> 00:51:25,052
They can't go anywhere, and it's raining.

779
00:51:25,052 --> 00:51:27,073
Their clothes are drenched, and they become chilly.

780
00:51:27,192 --> 00:51:29,623
And the boiler at the inn is broken.

781
00:51:29,623 --> 00:51:31,232
They need to be in a situation where they can't help...

782
00:51:31,232 --> 00:51:32,833
but share each other's body temperature.

783
00:51:32,833 --> 00:51:36,383
That's when something will finally happen. You know nothing.

784
00:51:39,203 --> 00:51:40,622
I don't even want to think about it.

785
00:51:58,892 --> 00:52:00,342
Our flight got canceled.

786
00:52:01,512 --> 00:52:03,313
The express bus drivers are on a strike,

787
00:52:03,314 --> 00:52:04,965
and the train tickets are all sold out.

788
00:52:07,512 --> 00:52:08,602
What should we do?

789
00:52:10,521 --> 00:52:12,432
We'll just have to borrow the car for a bit longer.

790
00:52:12,851 --> 00:52:14,372
We can't take the plane home anyway.

791
00:52:15,052 --> 00:52:16,671
Do you think we'll be able to go home?

792
00:52:16,862 --> 00:52:19,841
As long as the road doesn't get blocked due to a landslide,

793
00:52:20,121 --> 00:52:21,341
we'll be able to go home.

794
00:52:21,532 --> 00:52:22,812
Don't worry.

795
00:52:28,771 --> 00:52:31,471
We have breaking news. Due to the heavy rain in the southwest,

796
00:52:31,471 --> 00:52:33,961
a landslide has occurred in Mureung City...

797
00:52:34,112 --> 00:52:36,112
which ended up blocking the nearby coastal road.

798
00:52:36,112 --> 00:52:38,842
The authorities have sent people to urgently clear up the road,

799
00:52:38,842 --> 00:52:42,001
and they announced that it'll take around six hours.

800
00:52:42,081 --> 00:52:43,621
We will update you...

801
00:52:43,621 --> 00:52:45,181
- as soon as we hear more. - She can't be there, right?

802
00:52:45,181 --> 00:52:46,731
- We will move onto the next news. - No way.

803
00:52:53,322 --> 00:52:55,611
How is this even possible?

804
00:52:56,092 --> 00:52:58,352
How can this happen?

805
00:52:58,462 --> 00:53:00,012
It's like someone planned this.

806
00:53:00,771 --> 00:53:03,082
Are you saying I planned this?

807
00:53:03,101 --> 00:53:05,521
You were the one who suggested that we should come here.

808
00:53:05,672 --> 00:53:07,712
I knew something was weird when you insisted on...

809
00:53:07,712 --> 00:53:11,080
renting a car just so we could come all the way here.

810
00:53:11,081 --> 00:53:13,361
I can't believe you used the main cut as bait.

811
00:53:13,382 --> 00:53:15,432
It was a great idea. You totally fooled me.

812
00:53:15,882 --> 00:53:18,032
Will you stop talking nonsense?

813
00:53:18,121 --> 00:53:21,492
Then are you saying I caused the landslide?

814
00:53:21,492 --> 00:53:24,372
No, but you could've seen the weather forecast.

815
00:53:24,721 --> 00:53:28,111
Isn't it more plausible to say you created this scenario?

816
00:53:28,661 --> 00:53:32,251
No, I'm very up to date when it comes to romance.

817
00:53:32,402 --> 00:53:34,821
This kind of stuff doesn't even happen in dramas.

818
00:53:35,172 --> 00:53:37,771
This kind of scenario is for people who are lame...

819
00:53:37,771 --> 00:53:39,321
just like you.

820
00:53:39,501 --> 00:53:40,662
What? "Lame"?

821
00:53:40,911 --> 00:53:42,442
Are you seriously going to blame it on me?

822
00:53:42,442 --> 00:53:44,231
We'll soon find out.

823
00:53:44,581 --> 00:53:46,411
You just wait and see.

824
00:53:46,411 --> 00:53:48,982
We'll end up going to a bed and breakfast...

825
00:53:48,982 --> 00:53:50,702
that's run by an old lady.

826
00:53:52,922 --> 00:53:54,692
(Bed and Breakfast)

827
00:53:54,692 --> 00:53:56,001
Hello?

828
00:53:57,621 --> 00:53:58,812
Is anyone here?

829
00:53:59,762 --> 00:54:02,362
Is this the only place you could find?

830
00:54:02,362 --> 00:54:05,711
You saw the map as well. This was the only bed and breakfast.

831
00:54:05,862 --> 00:54:08,001
Exactly. It's weird that you drove to a place...

832
00:54:08,001 --> 00:54:11,292
where there's only one bed and breakfast.

833
00:54:15,442 --> 00:54:16,662
Is no one here?

834
00:54:17,242 --> 00:54:18,731
Are you here...

835
00:54:19,541 --> 00:54:23,001
to stay the night?

836
00:54:25,121 --> 00:54:26,731
Yes, we're here to stay the night.

837
00:54:28,621 --> 00:54:30,962
I bet she'll say there's only one room left.

838
00:54:30,962 --> 00:54:33,111
There are three rooms.

839
00:54:34,331 --> 00:54:36,611
But do you only need one room?

840
00:54:38,661 --> 00:54:40,921
You can rent an entire annex.

841
00:54:42,072 --> 00:54:44,101
We'll... We'll pay for the annex.

842
00:54:44,101 --> 00:54:46,251
We'll take a room each.

843
00:54:46,402 --> 00:54:49,062
And she'll even use the extra room.

844
00:54:49,742 --> 00:54:52,512
We'll sleep separately...

845
00:54:52,512 --> 00:54:54,332
and make sure we don't even touch.

846
00:54:56,251 --> 00:54:59,901
Do as you wish.

847
00:55:00,221 --> 00:55:01,901
Okay. Thank you.

848
00:55:02,192 --> 00:55:03,242
Thank you.

849
00:55:08,161 --> 00:55:10,732
I guess we need to use that to cook our own rice.

850
00:55:10,732 --> 00:55:12,060
I guess so.

851
00:55:12,061 --> 00:55:15,021
But do you think you can sleep here?

852
00:55:15,371 --> 00:55:17,051
I'll just sleep in the car.

853
00:55:17,701 --> 00:55:20,321
- No, I'll sleep in the car. - Here.

854
00:55:22,311 --> 00:55:24,091
You can change into this.

855
00:55:25,482 --> 00:55:26,961
Okay.

856
00:55:27,652 --> 00:55:28,932
You're so kind.

857
00:55:30,451 --> 00:55:31,631
We'll get changed.

858
00:55:35,422 --> 00:55:37,972
- The phone is turned off. - Ha Ri isn't home yet.

859
00:55:38,692 --> 00:55:39,822
Her phone's turned off as well.

860
00:55:39,822 --> 00:55:42,582
She told me she's low on battery. She can't come home tonight.

861
00:55:42,692 --> 00:55:43,881
She's going to sleep outside?

862
00:55:44,802 --> 00:55:46,452
She's with Mr. Han, isn't she?

863
00:55:47,371 --> 00:55:50,722
Are you going to let your daughter spend the night with a guy?

864
00:55:50,842 --> 00:55:53,122
You should go there and drag her home.

865
00:55:53,911 --> 00:55:56,562
I'm actually glad that my daughter's spending the night with a guy.

866
00:55:57,041 --> 00:55:58,691
What kind of guy is he?

867
00:55:58,842 --> 00:56:00,911
Is he normal? How old is he? Does he have his own house?

868
00:56:00,911 --> 00:56:02,001
Is he diligent?

869
00:56:04,382 --> 00:56:07,271
He doesn't own anything, and he's very old.

870
00:56:07,451 --> 00:56:10,372
On top of that, he looks very scary. He has really dark skin.

871
00:56:11,462 --> 00:56:13,312
He's a weirdo. I don't like him.

872
00:56:14,092 --> 00:56:16,082
Then why don't you marry Ha Ri?

873
00:56:18,762 --> 00:56:21,802
I'm just worried about her like an older brother.

874
00:56:21,802 --> 00:56:23,021
Don't take it out on me.

875
00:56:24,201 --> 00:56:26,691
An older brother, my foot. You were born a month later.

876
00:56:26,802 --> 00:56:30,421
Wait until she comes home. I'll teach that brat a lesson.

877
00:56:33,982 --> 00:56:35,702
The phone doesn't work here.

878
00:57:33,871 --> 00:57:37,231
I Sang, you're like a country boy.

879
00:57:37,242 --> 00:57:38,932
What are you talking about?

880
00:57:39,181 --> 00:57:42,162
People think I'm from abroad. They call me Kevin.

881
00:57:42,851 --> 00:57:43,972
Daniel.

882
00:57:44,121 --> 00:57:45,231
Sure.

883
00:57:54,992 --> 00:57:57,452
Why are you burning firewood?

884
00:57:58,061 --> 00:57:59,952
We have a stove.

885
00:58:01,771 --> 00:58:05,222
It's an induction stove. Is that why you couldn't find it?

886
00:58:06,902 --> 00:58:08,521
We saw an iron cauldron.

887
00:58:09,471 --> 00:58:11,162
I put that there to make the place look nice.

888
00:58:16,052 --> 00:58:17,671
Did you cook rice?

889
00:58:17,851 --> 00:58:19,771
We provide meals for our guests.

890
00:58:19,951 --> 00:58:22,602
We bring it all the way to your room like a hotel room service.

891
00:58:24,061 --> 00:58:27,282
You guys are very old-fashioned.

892
00:58:36,001 --> 00:58:37,651
It's nice and warm.

893
00:58:39,302 --> 00:58:41,662
Here's your coffee.

894
00:58:42,271 --> 00:58:43,622
- Thank you. - No problem.

895
00:58:44,982 --> 00:58:46,532
I've never had coffee in a bowl.

896
00:58:47,311 --> 00:58:48,602
Bowl coffee.

897
00:58:52,751 --> 00:58:56,571
I Sang, how did you end up doing photography?

898
00:58:57,462 --> 00:59:00,841
My dad used to enjoy taking photos.

899
00:59:01,232 --> 00:59:02,931
I used to follow my dad to the photo studio...

900
00:59:02,931 --> 00:59:04,682
every time he went there to get his photos printed out.

901
00:59:05,032 --> 00:59:07,211
Then I'd follow him again once the photos were ready.

902
00:59:07,732 --> 00:59:09,421
I enjoyed doing that.

903
00:59:11,041 --> 00:59:13,591
I guess that's why your photos are always so warm.

904
00:59:18,411 --> 00:59:20,432
Your photos are just like you.

905
00:59:24,822 --> 00:59:27,552
Back in the past, we had to wait...

906
00:59:27,552 --> 00:59:29,202
until the photos came out.

907
00:59:30,052 --> 00:59:32,642
It was exciting to wait for them.

908
00:59:33,521 --> 00:59:35,881
It's just like how I can't wait to find out...

909
00:59:36,262 --> 00:59:38,082
what will happen tomorrow.

910
00:59:41,132 --> 00:59:43,321
I'm more curious about today.

911
00:59:46,201 --> 00:59:49,662
I wonder how we'll end up spending the night together.

912
01:00:18,971 --> 01:00:20,421
It's good, right?

913
01:00:33,021 --> 01:00:34,841
- Are you done washing up? - Yes.

914
01:00:34,951 --> 01:00:37,042
Well, I was just about to wash up myself.

915
01:00:37,661 --> 01:00:38,711
I see.

916
01:00:40,322 --> 01:00:42,312
Do they have hot water?

917
01:00:42,632 --> 01:00:44,282
Yes, lots of it.

918
01:00:45,431 --> 01:00:47,952
Right. Good night then.

919
01:00:49,101 --> 01:00:51,292
- Good night. - You too.

920
01:02:39,782 --> 01:02:45,532
(Mr. Han, are you awake?)

921
01:02:48,951 --> 01:02:50,372
(Mr. Han, are you awake?)

922
01:04:13,442 --> 01:04:14,762
Mr. Han!

923
01:04:16,141 --> 01:04:17,662
What are you doing over there?

924
01:04:31,922 --> 01:04:33,042
What is it?

925
01:04:33,962 --> 01:04:35,111
Just a second.

926
01:04:37,462 --> 01:04:40,012
Why are you whispering?

927
01:04:52,811 --> 01:04:53,961
Wait.

928
01:05:07,632 --> 01:05:08,782
This looks so cool.

929
01:05:30,581 --> 01:05:32,301
Gosh, the wind.

930
01:05:34,592 --> 01:05:36,142
My hair's all over the place.

931
01:05:40,661 --> 01:05:42,912
- What a windy day. - What?

932
01:05:50,632 --> 01:05:54,091
Being a big guy, I'm sure you can block the wind for me...

933
01:07:36,471 --> 01:07:38,211
(The herbal infertility treatment introduced in the first episode...)

934
01:07:38,211 --> 01:07:40,332
(was only fabricated for the purpose of the show.)

935
01:07:40,381 --> 01:07:43,252
(Oh My Baby)

936
01:07:43,252 --> 01:07:44,822
You spend the night with him,

937
01:07:44,822 --> 01:07:46,802
but you're telling me you are in a meeting?

938
01:07:46,952 --> 01:07:48,051
Sorry about that.

939
01:07:48,051 --> 01:07:50,051
Why are you apologizing? It's even more annoying.

940
01:07:50,051 --> 01:07:51,521
You need to be wise when choosing men.

941
01:07:51,521 --> 01:07:54,061
Don't be swooned by what you see on the outside.

942
01:07:54,061 --> 01:07:56,242
- You... - I don't need you to protect me.

943
01:07:56,391 --> 01:07:58,712
I'm 39, not 19.

944
01:07:58,732 --> 01:08:00,732
Shouldn't you explain yourself?

945
01:08:00,732 --> 01:08:03,402
I'll start by saying we live under the same roof.

946
01:08:03,402 --> 01:08:05,801
Being this small should be a crime since it makes you...

947
01:08:05,801 --> 01:08:07,792
snugly fit in my embrace.

948
01:08:09,072 --> 01:08:10,492
How do you think of me as a woman?

949
01:08:12,442 --> 01:08:13,561
What?
