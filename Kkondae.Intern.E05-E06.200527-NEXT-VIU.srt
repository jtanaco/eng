1
00:00:13,491 --> 00:00:14,891
Thank you, Man Sic.

2
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:16,130
"Man Sic"?

3
00:00:29,071 --> 00:00:31,180
Don't you think Mr. Ga is insane?

4
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:34,511
How can we eat burgers after we drank so much last night?

5
00:00:34,511 --> 00:00:35,710
Yes, exactly.

6
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:38,320
And he told someone who's old enough to be his dad to grill meat.

7
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,380
I loathe that.

8
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:40,380
"Loathe"?

9
00:00:46,121 --> 00:00:49,361
That's when I reached this conviction.

10
00:00:53,231 --> 00:00:55,130
You stand no chance against me.

11
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,301
Something is seriously wrong.

12
00:01:07,151 --> 00:01:08,950
(Episode 5)

13
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:13,220
Looking great.

14
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,390
Those jerks.

15
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:22,791
Don't let these emotions get a hold of you.

16
00:01:24,231 --> 00:01:28,330
IVL, IVL. Iced vanilla latte. IVL.

17
00:01:28,571 --> 00:01:31,541
HVL, HVL. Hot vanilla latte.

18
00:01:31,541 --> 00:01:34,610
HVL, HVL. GHB.

19
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:39,041
Grapefruit honey black...

20
00:01:39,481 --> 00:01:41,851
Right, grapefruit honey black tea.

21
00:01:45,381 --> 00:01:47,080
ICM, ICM.

22
00:01:47,821 --> 00:01:49,550
It's all his fault.

23
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:52,991
I lost my cool because of him and made an awful move.

24
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:57,931
I need to deal with him at a higher level.

25
00:02:04,571 --> 00:02:06,541
Mr. Ga, are you okay?

26
00:02:14,151 --> 00:02:15,780
Don't get carried away by your emotions.

27
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:18,521
Yes, I'm fine.

28
00:02:18,921 --> 00:02:22,051
ICM. Iced caramel mocha. Iced caramel mocha.

29
00:02:22,051 --> 00:02:23,750
Iced caramel mocha.

30
00:02:25,121 --> 00:02:28,290
HCM. Hot caramel mocha.

31
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,030
What happened?

32
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,771
How did Binghao end up saying,

33
00:02:35,771 --> 00:02:38,600
"Thank you, Man Sic"?

34
00:02:39,141 --> 00:02:42,040
And did we end up signing the contract because of you?

35
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,040
It's...

36
00:02:44,111 --> 00:02:45,211
I don't remember either.

37
00:02:45,211 --> 00:02:47,410
Why can't we work as a team?

38
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:49,611
How can I trust you and keep leaving you in charge?

39
00:02:49,611 --> 00:02:50,750
I'm sorry.

40
00:02:52,621 --> 00:02:53,621
Goodness.

41
00:02:58,961 --> 00:03:03,591
There's no need to lose your spirits, though.

42
00:03:04,431 --> 00:03:07,230
If you ended up getting the contract while you were wasted,

43
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:10,771
that means you're a very competent man.

44
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,641
That means I wasn't wrong in hiring you for this position.

45
00:03:18,841 --> 00:03:20,681
Okay, listen up.

46
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,250
Now that things ended up like this,

47
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:26,250
- make sure you take the credit. - Pardon?

48
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,091
Don't let him take your credit for doing nothing.

49
00:03:28,091 --> 00:03:30,421
You deserve to take all the credit for that.

50
00:03:30,421 --> 00:03:32,560
I'll make sure I speak up on that too.

51
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:40,000
Chairman, you're here.

52
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Goodness, I heard you sealed the deal with Hauhau.

53
00:03:47,141 --> 00:03:49,611
I knew you could do it, Ga Yeol Chan.

54
00:03:49,741 --> 00:03:51,141
I thought it might be tough,

55
00:03:51,141 --> 00:03:52,810
but you ended up making it happen!

56
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:56,051
See that, Chairman? I told you he'll make it happen,

57
00:03:56,051 --> 00:03:57,280
but you were still nervous.

58
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:02,051
So I thought Mr. Ga did something to get on your bad side.

59
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,690
Goodness, stop it.

60
00:04:03,961 --> 00:04:06,991
Mr. Ga wouldn't do anything that I disapprove of.

61
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:09,491
He might disapprove of me, though.

62
00:04:09,491 --> 00:04:10,931
Goodness, Chairman.

63
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,331
- My gosh. - No!

64
00:04:15,801 --> 00:04:18,470
Wait! That... That contract.

65
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:23,941
Intern Lee Man Sic got that contract.

66
00:04:24,381 --> 00:04:25,381
What?

67
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,081
What are you talking about?

68
00:04:27,081 --> 00:04:28,881
Yes, he's right.

69
00:04:29,581 --> 00:04:31,081
We have an intern named Lee Man Sic.

70
00:04:31,881 --> 00:04:35,120
Our senior intern who just started here got that contract.

71
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:38,061
What happened?

72
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:39,660
Well...

73
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:41,961
He's right.

74
00:04:42,561 --> 00:04:44,300
While we were all knocked out,

75
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,930
our senior intern caught the heart of our buyer,

76
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:48,771
so we ended up showing this great performance.

77
00:04:50,201 --> 00:04:51,501
Goodness, really?

78
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:54,571
How did you talk him into this?

79
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:58,240
Well, I don't really remember.

80
00:04:59,441 --> 00:05:00,441
Goodness.

81
00:05:01,381 --> 00:05:03,980
You're a funny guy.

82
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,591
I'm sure it wasn't easy...

83
00:05:07,591 --> 00:05:10,891
to start from the rock bottom after you worked in a higher position.

84
00:05:11,191 --> 00:05:13,191
So? Are things going well at work?

85
00:05:13,191 --> 00:05:16,331
Of course, it's going great.

86
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:20,001
Is this what kids these days call the second chance in life?

87
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,701
Gosh, things have been very refreshing for me.

88
00:05:23,271 --> 00:05:24,870
Is that so? Goodness.

89
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:29,011
I learned something huge from you today.

90
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,040
Goodness, don't say that.

91
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,610
My gosh, Chairman. Stop it.

92
00:05:34,951 --> 00:05:37,011
Don't lose your spirit just because you're an intern,

93
00:05:37,011 --> 00:05:39,821
and please continue to show everything you can like you did now.

94
00:05:39,821 --> 00:05:42,790
Yes, of course, I will.

95
00:05:44,891 --> 00:05:46,461
So have you eaten?

96
00:05:46,461 --> 00:05:47,831
Do you want to grab a bite with me?

97
00:05:48,191 --> 00:05:49,191
Do you?

98
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:50,930
You already ate.

99
00:05:51,961 --> 00:05:52,961
Well...

100
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:56,170
I already had Shock Shock Burger.

101
00:05:57,131 --> 00:05:59,701
I see. Shock Shock.

102
00:05:59,701 --> 00:06:00,701
- Yes. - Okay.

103
00:06:10,511 --> 00:06:13,280
Ga Yeol Chan, how did you end up...

104
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,490
falling behind that old man?

105
00:06:35,841 --> 00:06:38,881
I guess he did get on his bad side.

106
00:07:19,581 --> 00:07:21,251
You're okay. You're okay.

107
00:07:21,951 --> 00:07:23,920
You're okay. You're okay.

108
00:08:02,261 --> 00:08:04,091
Sir, are you all right?

109
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:07,901
Go. Go on your way.

110
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:10,230
How could I when you're like this?

111
00:08:10,331 --> 00:08:13,441
I'll be okay soon, so just go.

112
00:08:13,441 --> 00:08:14,511
But still...

113
00:08:14,711 --> 00:08:16,240
I said, go!

114
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,910
You're okay. You're okay.

115
00:08:29,521 --> 00:08:31,391
You're okay. You're okay.

116
00:08:57,781 --> 00:08:59,020
This is all because of you,

117
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,691
Lee Man Sic.

118
00:09:07,191 --> 00:09:11,100
I was surprised that you knew that intern's name.

119
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:15,730
Don't tell me you're interested in him.

120
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:19,801
Come on. I'm the one who proposed the senior internship program.

121
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,181
I learn so much, watching elderly men act humbly...

122
00:09:25,411 --> 00:09:27,010
and doing their best.

123
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:30,610
They motivate me to do better.

124
00:09:36,421 --> 00:09:39,860
Speaking of which, how about you give me...

125
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:43,860
just five percent of your share as a compliment?

126
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:52,441
Six months from now, they'll be voting for the CEO.

127
00:09:52,441 --> 00:09:54,841
Is it that hard to support your own son?

128
00:09:55,071 --> 00:09:57,740
Let's be frank. You do know that I'm the only conglomerate's son...

129
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,581
who doesn't have a single share of the company, right?

130
00:09:59,581 --> 00:10:01,951
This is why I lose dignity in the company.

131
00:10:01,951 --> 00:10:04,211
I have no power both inside and the outside of the company.

132
00:10:04,211 --> 00:10:07,250
You little punk. You little...

133
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:10,350
What are you blabbering about?

134
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:11,860
- Dad. - Hey.

135
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:12,961
Dad!

136
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:17,730
I'm so humiliated to hang out with my friends.

137
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:20,900
Even those 10-year-olds bragged about their shares.

138
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,630
So why won't you give me any?

139
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:24,031
You little punk!

140
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,240
Darn it.

141
00:10:26,341 --> 00:10:29,571
If it's because of the tax, I have a plan.

142
00:10:30,911 --> 00:10:32,740
You and I...

143
00:10:33,711 --> 00:10:35,581
can marry women from Monaco.

144
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:40,451
In Monaco, there's no such thing as inheritance or gift tax.

145
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,321
We can get our citizenship there.

146
00:10:43,321 --> 00:10:46,220
What kind of nonsense is that?

147
00:10:46,661 --> 00:10:50,431
Women there are beautiful. They're better than your bookkeeper.

148
00:10:53,801 --> 00:10:56,931
That little punk. I'm not a bookkeeper.

149
00:11:07,441 --> 00:11:09,850
All right, all right.

150
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:16,850
Come on, now. You can just make them do it.

151
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:19,591
That's absurd.

152
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:24,291
I'm just grateful that I can work again.

153
00:11:24,931 --> 00:11:27,600
Goodness. All right, then.

154
00:11:34,201 --> 00:11:37,211
I may be gluing receipts right now,

155
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:40,510
but I will succeed in the end.

156
00:11:41,181 --> 00:11:42,181
Amen.

This is ransomware.

169
00:12:24,051 --> 00:12:25,091
You probably don't.

170
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,390
I heard Sangsae Food was a victim as well.

171
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:30,661
I heard that as well. All their computers shut down.

172
00:12:30,661 --> 00:12:32,500
Goodness. What?

173
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,000
This is a security test.

174
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:35,701
- What? - What?

175
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,240
The Security Team said that they'd randomly send an email.

176
00:12:39,941 --> 00:12:41,941
Hold on. Didn't they say if you opened the email,

177
00:12:41,941 --> 00:12:43,740
your teammates would all get their security points deducted?

178
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,240
What are you talking about?

179
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,610
Darn it.

180
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:48,411
Oh, come on!

181
00:12:48,411 --> 00:12:49,610
Mr. Lee...

182
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:52,421
- My gosh! - I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

183
00:12:52,551 --> 00:12:54,120
What are you going to do?

184
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,421
- Come on. - Lee Man Sic...

185
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:06,331
I'm just glad that it wasn't real ransomware.

186
00:13:14,941 --> 00:13:16,640
About that security email test,

187
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:19,341
could you send them to our interns as well?

188
00:13:19,341 --> 00:13:20,341
The interns as well?

189
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:22,951
Yes. I'd like to include that in their evaluation.

190
00:13:23,681 --> 00:13:24,750
Sure.

191
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:28,220
Please send one to our senior intern as well.

192
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:30,390
Okay. But you do know that your entire team...

193
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:32,561
would be put at a disadvantage if they open it, right?

194
00:13:33,421 --> 00:13:35,161
Oh, really?

195
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:37,730
Then let's forget about it.

196
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:41,000
It won't matter if the interns open it.

197
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,331
Is that so?

198
00:13:44,301 --> 00:13:46,100
Get your facts straight.

199
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:49,841
Everyone thinks the same way. Why are you venting at me?

200
00:14:05,061 --> 00:14:06,691
Come on.

201
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,890
Should I tell them?

202
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:13,331
Which scumbag sent the ramyeon to the Yeonggok Borough Office?

203
00:14:15,531 --> 00:14:17,941
- It was me. Is something wrong? - Gosh.

204
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,140
Did you send Super Spicy Chicken Ramyeon...

205
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,301
to the elderly who are living alone?

206
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:24,211
I told you to send them White Chicken Ramyeon.

207
00:14:24,211 --> 00:14:26,781
How could you send them these?

208
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,650
Are you trying to kill them?

209
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:29,781
What do you mean?

210
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,980
Take a look at this.

211
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,821
- Are you serious? - I'm so humiliated.

212
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,490
- My gosh. - Gosh.

213
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:39,321
- Look at that title. - What is this?

214
00:14:39,321 --> 00:14:41,291
The comments are even worse. I'm so ashamed.

215
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:42,630
Let me see. Scroll down.

216
00:14:43,031 --> 00:14:44,900
- What? - Goodness.

217
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,760
- Why are they laughing so much? - No way.

218
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,801
- I can't believe this. - Why did he do this?

219
00:14:48,801 --> 00:14:50,370
That can't be.

220
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:51,370
- Seung Jin! - Sir?

221
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:53,571
You didn't explain...

222
00:14:53,571 --> 00:14:54,711
the types of ramyeon properly, did you?

223
00:14:56,411 --> 00:14:57,740
Are you serious?

224
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,510
Mr. Lee, it was only yesterday that I told you to memorize...

225
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:03,051
the newly-released ramyeon from our company.

226
00:15:03,051 --> 00:15:04,720
White Chicken Ramyeon and Super Spicy Chicken Ramyeon.

227
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,681
Didn't I tell you not to confuse them?

228
00:15:07,681 --> 00:15:10,020
I said the former was made with boiled chicken soup...

229
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,591
and that the latter was five times spicier...

230
00:15:11,591 --> 00:15:12,691
than Spicy Chicken Ramyeon.

231
00:15:12,691 --> 00:15:15,990
Is it that hard to differentiate them? Really? Gosh.

232
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,860
I explained it to him yesterday.

233
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,630
- What should we do? - What should we do?

234
00:15:23,831 --> 00:15:25,941
What should we do?

235
00:15:25,941 --> 00:15:27,071
(Super Spicy Chicken Ramyeon)

236
00:15:27,071 --> 00:15:28,240
I'm so ashamed.

237
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,211
Why is Super Spicy Chicken Ramyeon written here?

238
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:33,640
How should I know?

239
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,150
(Super Spicy Chicken Ramyeon)

240
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,380
(Super Spicy Chicken Ramyeon)

241
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:45,821
How will you work with those eyes?

242
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:50,461
I'm sorry. I'll get cataract surgery.

243
00:15:50,461 --> 00:15:52,801
Did you hear that?

244
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,600
Forget it.

245
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,100
Retrieve the ramyeon before any of them eats it!

246
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,541
Right now!

247
00:15:59,171 --> 00:16:01,640
Even if we all went, we wouldn't be able to retrieve all 300 boxes.

248
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,311
We should go immediately.

249
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:05,811
Mr. Oh, please ask the other teams for help.

250
00:16:05,811 --> 00:16:06,811
Yes, sir.

251
00:16:06,811 --> 00:16:08,551
- My gosh! - Let's hurry.

252
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:12,051
Saying sorry isn't enough. I can't believe you.

253
00:16:12,921 --> 00:16:15,620
This is the Marketing Department. Yes, sir.

254
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:18,421
We heard. We're about to.

255
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:20,720
You four should cover that area.

256
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,831
We'll go this way. Let's go.

257
00:16:23,061 --> 00:16:24,061
Okay.

258
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:27,561
- Okay. Let's go. - All right.

259
00:16:27,931 --> 00:16:28,931
Darn it.

260
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:47,120
Gosh, it's so tiring.

261
00:16:56,161 --> 00:16:58,431
Stop! Stop!

262
00:17:00,831 --> 00:17:02,470
- What? What is it? - Sir.

263
00:17:03,671 --> 00:17:05,140
- What are you doing? - Let go.

264
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,140
Sir.

265
00:17:06,301 --> 00:17:09,571
Sir, try this instead. You won't get a stomachache from this.

266
00:17:09,571 --> 00:17:11,880
Let us take that back and give you this instead.

267
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,880
Darn it.

268
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:15,610
- Darn it. - Gosh.

269
00:17:15,811 --> 00:17:17,380
- Hey, Yoon Soo. - Yes.

270
00:17:19,021 --> 00:17:20,551
All right. Here it goes.

271
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:21,950
Get it.

272
00:17:26,021 --> 00:17:27,860
All right. 1, 2, 3.

273
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:30,761
My goodness.

274
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:36,771
- Gosh. - Oh, my gosh.

275
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,571
Ms. Tak, your shoes.

276
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,741
I like wearing heels.

277
00:17:42,341 --> 00:17:43,440
All right.

278
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:44,670
Hurry.

279
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,410
Let's climb up.

280
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,640
Hurry.

281
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:50,410
Hurry up.

282
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:54,380
(Super Spicy Chicken Ramyeon)

283
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:12,841
Goodness.

284
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:26,380
(White Chicken Ramyeon)

285
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:40,031
All right.

286
00:18:55,581 --> 00:18:56,581
Mr. Ga.

287
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:59,420
- Let me help you. - No.

288
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,420
No.

289
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:07,390
My gosh.

290
00:19:17,301 --> 00:19:18,900
Mr. Ga.

291
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,291
All right. I'll call you. Okay.

292
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,261
Gosh, we're done.

293
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:41,690
That was awful.

294
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,491
- Good work. - Okay.

295
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,460
- Good work. - That was so awful!

296
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,860
- I'm so sick of it. Seriously. - Good work.

297
00:19:48,001 --> 00:19:50,471
- Good work. - I'm glad nothing happened to them.

298
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:53,100
Let's call it a day today.

299
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:54,910
Good job.

300
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:57,541
- Good work. - Good work.

301
00:19:58,071 --> 00:19:59,481
See you tomorrow. Bye.

302
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:01,180
- Good work. - Good work.

303
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:04,350
I know that there's a bench, but how can you sit right now?

304
00:20:13,321 --> 00:20:14,491
Good work.

305
00:20:15,491 --> 00:20:17,360
Everyone can make mistakes.

306
00:20:17,731 --> 00:20:19,200
Don't beat yourself up.

307
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,061
Go home and rest up.

308
00:20:22,801 --> 00:20:24,100
I'm sorry.

309
00:20:27,071 --> 00:20:28,071
Goodness.

310
00:20:28,511 --> 00:20:29,511
My gosh.

311
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:33,311
- Are you crying? - No, I'm not.

312
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:36,950
I feel like I'm only a stumbling block of our team.

313
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,321
No one thinks that way.

314
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:41,420
You were the one who got us that big deal yesterday.

315
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:50,491
Mr. Lee, you aren't a stumbling block,

316
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,660
but a stepping stone.

317
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,140
Gosh.

318
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,511
Yes, this is it.

319
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:11,821
I'll make him look bad indirectly.

320
00:21:16,321 --> 00:21:19,561
Well, you guys had to go through so much because of me.

321
00:21:20,091 --> 00:21:21,291
As an elder,

322
00:21:21,831 --> 00:21:25,331
I think it's only fair for me to buy you a drink.

323
00:21:25,331 --> 00:21:28,370
I don't think that's right.

324
00:21:29,731 --> 00:21:31,531
I'll get going now, Mr. Ga.

325
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:35,610
- Bye. - Good work today.

326
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:56,160
We should have called Mr. Lee too.

327
00:21:56,531 --> 00:21:58,261
Gosh, I feel bad.

328
00:21:58,261 --> 00:22:00,400
Oh, no. Think about all the trouble we went through...

329
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,071
because of that old geezer.

330
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:04,831
He humiliated the entire team. I won't drink with him.

331
00:22:04,831 --> 00:22:05,900
I agree.

332
00:22:06,001 --> 00:22:07,370
Who will go home if he comes?

333
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:08,370
Me.

334
00:22:14,581 --> 00:22:16,811
Gosh, I have a cramp.

335
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:20,950
By the way, do you think we can keep him on at the company?

336
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:22,021
We don't know what kind of trouble...

337
00:22:22,021 --> 00:22:23,890
- he will cause next. - My gosh.

338
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:26,061
But nothing happened yet.

339
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:33,200
- I'm going to use the restroom. - Okay.

340
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:39,400
My gosh, is Mr. Ga the Buddha or something?

341
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,640
How can you say you loathe him? He's an angel.

342
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,640
Take that back now.

343
00:22:47,281 --> 00:22:48,850
Who said what to whom?

344
00:22:49,811 --> 00:22:51,180
I'm sorry.

345
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:52,850
I take back that I loathe Mr. Ga.

346
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:54,950
I should loathe someone else.

347
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:57,190
Hey, we should consider ourselves lucky.

348
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:59,890
How could we get such a nice boss? And he's good at his job too.

349
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:02,561
Right. He's the best boss.

350

351

Goodness.

353

This all happened...

354
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,210
because he made me do...

355
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:23,811
such menial jobs when I'm the key player.

356

By the way, what are they doing?

357

- Hello. - Hello.

358
00:23:34,991 --> 00:23:36,690
- There are 6 of us. - 6?

359
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:38,430
- Yes. - This way, please.

360
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:41,130
All right.

361

For the second round, you can come to Ax and Ax...

366
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:58,650
Right. Kkon-tern called me and asked to have drinks with him.

So what? Are you going to join him?

(Oh Dong Geun: So what? Are you going to join him?)

374
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:11,930
Do you think I'm crazy?

375
00:24:12,831 --> 00:24:14,460
Should we invite him here?

376
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,630
If he really comes, it'd kill the mood.

377
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,200
How will you handle that?

378
00:24:18,571 --> 00:24:20,400
If he comes, I'm leaving.

379
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,311
See? Let him have drinks by himself.

380
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,440
Okay.

381
00:24:25,481 --> 00:24:28,311
By the way, who is this?

382

How dare they? They have no idea what I can do.

I'll teach them a lesson.

That stings.

What on earth happened to him?

395
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,140

00:27:09,271 --> 00:27:11,110
It was here just now.

409

Is it gone?

410
00:27:13,281 --> 00:27:17,081
Man, I was about to get finished. How can it disappear like this?

411
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,850
My gosh, it was here just now.

412

Man, I was all finished.

Yes, it'll begin this afternoon,

He's calling me now. It's Mr. Hong.

What do you mean, they can't do it at this point?

431

Eun Hye Soo said that?

432
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,581
Mr. Hong, can we go over and persuade her?

433
00:28:23,311 --> 00:28:25,251
Yes, okay.

434
00:28:27,481 --> 00:28:30,420
Eun Hye Soo suddenly said she doesn't want to do it.

435

Why is she suddenly doing this?

436

Mr. Lee Man Sic, are you acquainted with Eun Hye Soo?

437

You're right. Aren't you acquainted with her, old man?

So?

446
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:02,920
Should I give her a call?

447
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,950
Yes.

and she told us to come.

452
00:29:18,841 --> 00:29:19,900
You're lying.

453
00:29:20,241 --> 00:29:22,271
She doesn't want a group of people there,

454
00:29:22,271 --> 00:29:26,841
so she pointed out only Mr. Lee and the person in charge to come.

We can go with this. You're making Spicy Chicken Ramyeon at home,

501
00:32:28,474 --> 00:32:29,474
and suddenly...

502
00:32:30,143 --> 00:32:31,944
The goblin suddenly walks in.

503
00:32:31,944 --> 00:32:35,113
And the goblin sees bright red sauce on your mouth...

504
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:36,684
and says this.

505
00:32:36,684 --> 00:32:37,983
Did you eat a rat alive?

506
00:32:39,184 --> 00:32:40,624
And you answer him.

507
00:32:41,524 --> 00:32:44,323
No, I had chicken.

508
00:32:44,323 --> 00:32:45,893
Then the goblin goes...

509
00:32:45,893 --> 00:32:47,534
What kind of chicken did you eat...

510
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:50,603
to make you look so sexy?

511
00:32:51,733 --> 00:32:53,434
I want to eat you alive too.

512
00:32:53,434 --> 00:32:54,904
Then he kisses you!

513
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:00,244
My gosh, this is killing me.

514
00:33:00,474 --> 00:33:02,774
Eat what? Why should anyone eat anything alive?

515
00:33:02,774 --> 00:33:04,844
Stop making me eat. I'm already full as is.

516
00:33:04,844 --> 00:33:07,583
And it's sexual harassment to say...

517
00:33:07,583 --> 00:33:09,483
something like that these days.

518
00:33:10,323 --> 00:33:11,323
Goodness.

519
00:33:11,654 --> 00:33:14,393
My puppy, I'm sorry I just shouted.

520
00:33:19,094 --> 00:33:21,064
Come on, do something.

521
00:33:26,904 --> 00:33:28,274
Hey, Hye Soo.

522
00:33:28,633 --> 00:33:31,103
Can't you do this for me?

523
00:33:31,374 --> 00:33:33,244
Think of our old days.

524
00:33:34,013 --> 00:33:35,113
Exactly.

525
00:33:36,214 --> 00:33:37,643
I shouldn't do this to you...

526
00:33:37,643 --> 00:33:39,814
for old times' sake.

527
00:33:41,654 --> 00:33:45,124
I still keep what you told me back then...

528
00:33:45,124 --> 00:33:49,024
right here, deep in my heart.

529
00:33:51,923 --> 00:33:55,094
Come on, don't say that.

530
00:33:55,834 --> 00:33:58,563
What did I say to you?

531
00:34:02,603 --> 00:34:04,603
"I know our noodles are thick,"

532
00:34:04,844 --> 00:34:06,974
"but where did you get a thick girl like her?"

533
00:34:07,414 --> 00:34:09,173
"I'll eat my hat if she gets her break."

534
00:34:09,173 --> 00:34:11,443
"Goodness, just go back home..."

535
00:34:11,443 --> 00:34:13,154
"and try to get married."

536
00:34:13,154 --> 00:34:15,154
"You're very thick, so you're an eldest daughter-in-law material."

537
00:34:15,154 --> 00:34:17,483
"You'll have no trouble having kids."

538
00:34:18,853 --> 00:34:20,894
- Me? - "I told you to just pretend!"

539
00:34:20,894 --> 00:34:22,224
"Why did you eat everything?"

540
00:34:22,224 --> 00:34:23,724
"You just grew even bigger."

541
00:34:23,724 --> 00:34:24,964
"Are you a Hulk or what?"

542
00:34:24,964 --> 00:34:26,834
Who said something like that?

543
00:34:26,834 --> 00:34:28,034
I said, "You grew even bigger"?

544
00:34:28,034 --> 00:34:30,204
Me? No way.

545
00:34:30,704 --> 00:34:33,334
You know that I'm not a guy like that.

546
00:34:34,003 --> 00:34:36,303
After that traumatic experience,

547
00:34:36,543 --> 00:34:38,844
not only did I stay away from my favorite Osori thick noodles,

548
00:34:38,844 --> 00:34:41,014
I didn't go anywhere near any kind of ramyeon.

549
00:34:41,774 --> 00:34:42,774
I don't like this product placement.

550
00:34:43,514 --> 00:34:44,914
And it's not just the product placement.

551
00:34:45,384 --> 00:34:46,553
I hate him even more.

552
00:34:46,613 --> 00:34:48,214
I'm not doing this. Never. Never.

553
00:34:48,214 --> 00:34:49,313
No, no, no!

554
00:34:51,084 --> 00:34:53,193
I'm sorry I just shouted, Deng Deng.

555
00:35:06,164 --> 00:35:07,334
What are you going to do now?

556
00:35:07,834 --> 00:35:10,103
It's all because of you.

557
00:35:11,543 --> 00:35:14,074
How can you forget what you said to kill someone's heart?

558
00:35:15,974 --> 00:35:17,183
How will you take responsibility?

559
00:35:18,384 --> 00:35:21,214
How will you take responsibility for this?

560
00:35:33,534 --> 00:35:35,034
The least I can do is clean up her dog poop.

561
00:35:36,764 --> 00:35:39,063
Deng Deng! Come here.

562
00:35:39,063 --> 00:35:40,074
Goodness.

563
00:35:54,084 --> 00:35:55,483
My gosh, you startled me.

564
00:35:59,923 --> 00:36:01,454
Who is this old woman?

565
00:36:01,853 --> 00:36:04,824
Where's Ms. Yoo? Why is she here?

566
00:36:04,824 --> 00:36:06,193
Well...

567
00:36:08,664 --> 00:36:10,363
Who is she?

568
00:36:11,964 --> 00:36:13,303
The chairman said you always caused trouble...

569
00:36:13,303 --> 00:36:14,634
with the secretaries,

570
00:36:14,634 --> 00:36:18,443
so he wanted a senior intern to take place.

571
00:36:18,443 --> 00:36:19,443
Hello.

572
00:36:20,373 --> 00:36:23,443
I'm Ok Kyung, a senior intern.

573
00:36:23,443 --> 00:36:25,014
Whatever.

574
00:36:25,943 --> 00:36:27,954
"Ok..." "Ok Kyung"?

575
00:36:28,514 --> 00:36:29,613
Darn it.

576
00:36:37,224 --> 00:36:39,193
Hey, how's it going over there?

577
00:36:40,334 --> 00:36:41,693
It's not that good, sir.

578
00:36:43,733 --> 00:36:44,764
Is that so?

579
00:36:46,233 --> 00:36:50,074
I'm sure you're doing well.

580
00:36:50,274 --> 00:36:55,373
Of course, sir. Everything has turned into ashes.

581
00:36:55,373 --> 00:36:57,644
Good. Keep going.

582
00:36:57,714 --> 00:37:00,853
Better yet, turn Ga Yeol Chan into ashes.

583
00:37:00,853 --> 00:37:02,253
Don't worry too much.

584
00:37:02,683 --> 00:37:04,483
It's only difficult to make things successful.

585
00:37:04,623 --> 00:37:06,524
Ruining things is a piece of cake.

586
00:37:06,524 --> 00:37:07,553
Right.

587
00:37:10,623 --> 00:37:11,623
He's awesome.

588
00:37:13,193 --> 00:37:17,303
I wonder where in the world such a talented man has been.

589
00:37:19,664 --> 00:37:23,503
Now that we've come to this, should I destroy everything?

590
00:37:25,974 --> 00:37:28,373
But why do I feel hesitant?

591
00:37:41,224 --> 00:37:42,253
Don't come!

592
00:37:44,693 --> 00:37:45,693
Go away!

593
00:37:52,764 --> 00:37:53,774
Darn it.

594
00:37:57,574 --> 00:37:58,574
Gosh.

595
00:38:00,074 --> 00:38:01,974
Where in the world is he?

596
00:38:02,443 --> 00:38:04,843
Mr. Lee. Mr. Lee!

597
00:38:05,843 --> 00:38:07,053
Do something.

598
00:38:08,114 --> 00:38:11,884
Gosh, how could such a well-built man be so afraid?

599
00:38:11,884 --> 00:38:13,223
It's just a tiny dog.

600
00:38:13,223 --> 00:38:16,093
I'm allergic to dogs. It could be fatal!

601
00:38:16,093 --> 00:38:19,524
All right. I'll take care of this. Hey.

602
00:38:20,134 --> 00:38:21,134
Go.

603
00:38:21,264 --> 00:38:24,463
What? You little rat.

604
00:38:24,504 --> 00:38:25,534
Go!

605
00:38:25,664 --> 00:38:28,004
You little punk. Are you looking down on me?

606
00:38:28,303 --> 00:38:29,774
Go!

607
00:38:31,673 --> 00:38:34,014
You can't even take care of that little dog?

608
00:38:34,014 --> 00:38:35,073
Go!

609
00:39:05,404 --> 00:39:08,614
Mr. Oh, please tell everyone that they can leave.

610
00:39:11,244 --> 00:39:12,443
It's not going too well.

611
00:39:12,443 --> 00:39:15,254
Hey! Did you guys check out the portal sites?

612
00:39:15,484 --> 00:39:17,583
Do you know what the most-searched word is?

613
00:39:19,284 --> 00:39:20,823
Someone fainted after eating our Super Spicy Chicken Ramyeon.

614
00:39:20,823 --> 00:39:21,823
What?

615
00:39:21,823 --> 00:39:23,293
"Joonsu Food" is the second most-searched topic,

616
00:39:23,293 --> 00:39:24,764
and the list goes on.

617
00:39:24,764 --> 00:39:25,994
What are you talking about?

618
00:39:29,894 --> 00:39:30,904
(The most searched word)

619
00:39:30,904 --> 00:39:35,274
(A man faints after eating Super Spicy Chicken Ramyeon)

620
00:39:55,593 --> 00:39:58,524
Sir. Sir! Are you okay?

621
00:39:58,524 --> 00:40:00,134
- Oh, no! - Is that it?

622
00:40:00,134 --> 00:40:02,593
Are they even allowed to upload that video?

623
00:40:02,593 --> 00:40:05,104
He looks familiar.

624
00:40:06,634 --> 00:40:08,433
Hold on...

625
00:40:13,303 --> 00:40:15,644
It's Mr. Park Mak Doong.

626
00:40:15,813 --> 00:40:17,914
He's an elderly who received our ramyeon.

627
00:40:17,914 --> 00:40:20,154
We retrieved all the ramyeon.

628
00:40:20,154 --> 00:40:21,813
I thought we took them all.

629
00:40:25,854 --> 00:40:29,593
Mr. Oh, please put me on speakerphone.

630
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:30,664
Yes, sir.

631
00:40:31,394 --> 00:40:32,764
- Gather around. - Okay.

632
00:40:35,793 --> 00:40:36,904
Can you hear me?

633
00:40:36,904 --> 00:40:37,904
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

634
00:40:37,904 --> 00:40:41,034
Mr. Oh, contact the Response Team and ask them to delete the video.

635
00:40:41,034 --> 00:40:44,004
I'm sure the video has been shared already.

636
00:40:44,144 --> 00:40:46,173
Contact the video platform directly.

637
00:40:46,173 --> 00:40:47,943
Make the videos inaccessible.

638
00:40:47,943 --> 00:40:49,943
- Yes, sir. - Also, please find out...

639
00:40:50,083 --> 00:40:51,713
- who uploaded it. - Yes, sir.

640
00:40:51,713 --> 00:40:54,213
Ms. Tak, let's block all malicious articles.

641
00:40:54,213 --> 00:40:55,813
We should delete the ones that have been posted as well.

642
00:40:55,813 --> 00:40:56,854
Yes, sir.

643
00:40:56,854 --> 00:40:59,284
It won't be easy, but I need the rest of you...

644
00:40:59,453 --> 00:41:01,654
to look for Mr. Park.

645
00:41:01,654 --> 00:41:02,754
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

646
00:41:03,124 --> 00:41:04,963
Mr. Lee and I will join you right away.

647
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:06,394
Yes, sir.

648
00:41:07,333 --> 00:41:09,093
Seung Jin, take him and leave right now.

649
00:41:09,093 --> 00:41:10,134
Yes, sir.

650
00:41:13,803 --> 00:41:16,673
Hello, this is the Marketing Department.

651
00:41:16,673 --> 00:41:18,343
Are the cameras ready?

652
00:41:18,573 --> 00:41:21,144
Let's begin filming.

653
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:27,313
Let's go. We don't have time for this.

654
00:41:27,313 --> 00:41:29,553
Are you going to give up on Eun Hye Soo like this?

655
00:41:29,614 --> 00:41:30,654
I should stay behind...

656
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:31,754
And do what?

657
00:41:32,254 --> 00:41:34,354
I should find a way to convince her.

658
00:41:34,354 --> 00:41:37,124
She won't give in. Don't you get it?

659
00:41:37,793 --> 00:41:39,364
How do you know?

660
00:41:39,693 --> 00:41:41,734
Because if it were me, I wouldn't listen to you.

661
00:41:42,394 --> 00:41:43,504
Ever.

662
00:41:45,634 --> 00:41:47,504
How do you know how I feel so well?

663
00:41:58,644 --> 00:41:59,683
Hye Soo.

664
00:42:00,384 --> 00:42:01,484
I was wrong.

665
00:42:01,484 --> 00:42:03,723
I shouldn't have been so rude to you.

666
00:42:04,624 --> 00:42:06,894
I apologize. I did you wrong.

667
00:42:07,494 --> 00:42:09,754
How could I make you feel better?

668
00:42:10,923 --> 00:42:11,923
Do you want to slap me?

669
00:42:11,923 --> 00:42:15,593
If that'll make you feel better, be my guest.

670
00:42:15,963 --> 00:42:18,504
Whom are you trying to console?

671
00:42:18,634 --> 00:42:20,803
Me? You?

672
00:42:21,173 --> 00:42:22,874
Look, here.

673
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:26,343
You shouldn't apologize just because you feel like it.

674
00:42:34,313 --> 00:42:36,313
Fine, then. Forget it.

675
00:42:36,553 --> 00:42:38,154
Forget it.

676
00:42:38,154 --> 00:42:40,394
Let's be honest. If this falls through,

677
00:42:40,394 --> 00:42:41,524
it's better for me.

678
00:42:41,524 --> 00:42:42,524
Do you even know that?

679
00:42:42,524 --> 00:42:45,664
You have no idea.

680
00:42:45,764 --> 00:42:48,833
Also, how long do you think you can maintain your fame?

681
00:42:48,833 --> 00:42:51,063
You'll become a nobody very soon.

682
00:42:51,063 --> 00:42:53,874
The younger ones will soon replace you.

683
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:58,644
Goodness. Look at all those wrinkles around your eyes!

684
00:42:58,644 --> 00:43:01,673
Come down! I'm sorry. Come down!

685
00:43:02,774 --> 00:43:04,644
I have no wrinkles yet!

686
00:43:04,744 --> 00:43:07,154
Mr. Kim! Bring me some salt!

687
00:43:07,813 --> 00:43:08,813
My goodness!

688
00:43:11,124 --> 00:43:13,384
What's your deal? Are you the spy in "X-Man"?

689
00:43:13,553 --> 00:43:15,823
Why do you cause trouble wherever you go?

690
00:43:17,323 --> 00:43:19,024
Does it feel good to say what's on your mind?

691
00:43:19,193 --> 00:43:20,463
Do you still not get it?

692
00:43:21,593 --> 00:43:23,833
Someone may be in a critical condition because of you.

693
00:43:23,833 --> 00:43:25,904
Don't be ridiculous! No one will die because of me.

694
00:43:26,504 --> 00:43:29,004
I'm not the one who came up with that ramyeon to begin with!

695
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:33,443
Is it...

696
00:43:34,374 --> 00:43:35,573
my fault again?

697
00:43:52,563 --> 00:43:53,563
Excuse me, sir.

698
00:43:54,433 --> 00:43:57,364
Please don't get any bad ideas.

699
00:44:14,583 --> 00:44:17,384
What is that sound?

700
00:44:17,524 --> 00:44:20,624
- Goodness. - My goodness.

701
00:44:20,624 --> 00:44:22,593
What happened?

702
00:44:22,953 --> 00:44:25,293
My goodness.

703
00:44:31,963 --> 00:44:34,303
I do admit that I was wrong.

704
00:44:34,803 --> 00:44:38,374
But it is your fault as well for not checking the order list.

705
00:44:38,943 --> 00:44:40,573
That's what your position is for.

706
00:44:42,343 --> 00:44:43,473
That's enough.

707
00:44:47,813 --> 00:44:50,654
The superiors are busy causing a mess.

708
00:44:50,654 --> 00:44:52,884
And those under them need to be taken care of all the time.

709
00:44:52,884 --> 00:44:54,624
I said, enough!

710
00:44:54,624 --> 00:44:56,254
Watch out!

711
00:45:05,034 --> 00:45:06,664
Be careful!

712
00:45:28,394 --> 00:45:29,823
How is Yeol Chan handling the situation?

713
00:45:30,593 --> 00:45:31,994
He's trying to fix this,

714
00:45:31,994 --> 00:45:33,463
but the video has spread too much already.

715
00:45:33,463 --> 00:45:35,793
A decline in sales seems inevitable.

716
00:45:35,793 --> 00:45:37,333
Darn it.

717
00:45:37,333 --> 00:45:38,933
Dad!

718
00:45:39,764 --> 00:45:42,634
Did you see the video? Did you?

719
00:45:42,634 --> 00:45:46,203
I knew Ga Yeol Chan would mess up badly one day.

720
00:45:46,504 --> 00:45:50,173
By the way, can we sell such dangerous ramyeon?

721
00:45:50,514 --> 00:45:51,683
That's crazy.

722
00:45:51,683 --> 00:45:53,614
Dad, did you know?

723
00:45:53,713 --> 00:45:56,414
There are people who died from eating...

724
00:45:56,414 --> 00:45:58,453
- really spicy chili peppers. - You punk.

725
00:45:58,453 --> 00:46:00,593
Are you happy now? Are you?

726
00:46:00,593 --> 00:46:03,024
The company's reputation is about to go down the drain.

727
00:46:03,024 --> 00:46:04,024
How can you laugh now?

728
00:46:04,024 --> 00:46:06,793
You punk.

729
00:46:07,534 --> 00:46:08,793
Punk.

730
00:46:09,494 --> 00:46:11,433
Are you abusing your power right now?

731
00:46:12,264 --> 00:46:16,004
Listen. I don't know how powerful your position is at the company.

732
00:46:16,004 --> 00:46:17,404
You'd better stop now.

733
00:46:17,404 --> 00:46:19,374
I'm really close with the people at the Labor Office.

734
00:46:19,374 --> 00:46:23,043
Hey, aren't you the intern in my department?

735
00:46:23,274 --> 00:46:24,744
- What? - What?

736
00:46:24,744 --> 00:46:26,414
- Gosh. - I'm sorry.

737
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:28,583
Hey. Turn it off now.

738
00:46:28,583 --> 00:46:30,114
Stop!

739
00:46:30,114 --> 00:46:31,683
Stop. Don't come any closer to me...

740
00:46:32,053 --> 00:46:34,093
If you take a step toward me,

741
00:46:34,754 --> 00:46:36,753
I'll hit the send button right away.

742
00:46:36,753 --> 00:46:38,693
Don't you know how the chairman of our company looks?

743
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:40,963
Chairman?

744
00:46:41,394 --> 00:46:42,394
Turn it off!

745
00:46:47,273 --> 00:46:49,304
Wait. I mean,

746
00:46:49,634 --> 00:46:51,443
even if he's the chairman,

747
00:46:51,443 --> 00:46:53,544
he doesn't have the right to mistreat...

748
00:46:53,544 --> 00:46:56,144
a powerless employee.

749
00:46:56,374 --> 00:46:58,814
A man fell and got beaten up.

750
00:46:58,814 --> 00:47:00,283
He was definitely violent.

751
00:47:01,384 --> 00:47:03,283
Don't you remember the violent incident with the airline?

752
00:47:05,283 --> 00:47:07,854
Who is this crazy woman?

753
00:47:10,023 --> 00:47:11,693
- Let's just go. - Yes, sir.

754
00:47:15,763 --> 00:47:17,104
I know that she's an intern,

755
00:47:17,104 --> 00:47:19,134
but you should make her remember the face of her boss.

756
00:47:19,134 --> 00:47:20,733
- I will. I'm sorry. - Gosh.

757
00:47:21,404 --> 00:47:22,404
Darn it.

758
00:47:24,844 --> 00:47:25,844
Goodness.

759
00:47:30,743 --> 00:47:31,914
Darn it.

760
00:47:33,683 --> 00:47:37,783
Darn it. You must've gone mad. You're insane, Lee Tae Lee.

761
00:47:37,783 --> 00:47:41,624
You promised yourself to live a normal life. Darn it.

762
00:47:42,824 --> 00:47:44,324
Hey. Hey!

763
00:47:44,324 --> 00:47:47,134
Darn it. What does he want from me now? Why is he calling me?

764
00:47:47,134 --> 00:47:48,334
Hey, let's talk.

765
00:47:48,334 --> 00:47:51,134
Come on. I don't want to make this worse.

766
00:47:51,134 --> 00:47:52,664
Don't talk to me.

767
00:47:52,933 --> 00:47:54,834
- You got it wrong. - My gosh.

768
00:47:55,673 --> 00:47:57,804
Listen. If I lose my job,

769
00:47:57,804 --> 00:47:59,503
will you take responsibility for it?

770
00:47:59,804 --> 00:48:04,013
Nothing happened between you and me today.

771
00:48:04,983 --> 00:48:06,213
Hey, date me.

772
00:48:12,124 --> 00:48:13,453
You are...

773
00:48:14,953 --> 00:48:16,794
the first woman who saved me...

774
00:48:16,794 --> 00:48:18,023
after my mother died.

775
00:48:21,294 --> 00:48:22,294
What?

776
00:48:33,374 --> 00:48:35,374
Yes, Mr. Yang. Who's giving us trouble?

777
00:48:35,374 --> 00:48:37,144
Hankyung. It's falling on deaf ears.

778
00:48:37,144 --> 00:48:38,314
Hankyung Sports.

779
00:48:39,314 --> 00:48:40,584
I'll call them myself.

780
00:48:46,624 --> 00:48:47,624
This is Hankyung.

781
00:48:47,624 --> 00:48:50,824
How could you release an article without checking the facts first?

782
00:48:51,564 --> 00:48:52,864
We'll check again.

783
00:48:54,094 --> 00:48:55,193
Please do so.

784
00:48:55,193 --> 00:48:56,933
Okay. I'll check again.

785
00:49:01,933 --> 00:49:03,574
When we were moving the ramyeon boxes,

786
00:49:03,574 --> 00:49:05,673
were you eating candies?

787
00:49:06,273 --> 00:49:07,943
No, it's not that.

788
00:49:07,943 --> 00:49:12,114
That old man asked me to leave Super Spicy Chicken Ramyeon.

789
00:49:12,114 --> 00:49:14,283
He said he wouldn't eat it and would give it to his grandson.

790
00:49:14,283 --> 00:49:16,013
So I couldn't take it from him.

791
00:49:16,013 --> 00:49:18,223
Then, why didn't you tell me that?

792
00:49:18,223 --> 00:49:20,723
I'm sorry. I didn't know this would happen.

793
00:49:20,723 --> 00:49:23,824
Forget it. If something happens to the old man, it's all your fault.

794
00:49:23,824 --> 00:49:24,963
Did you get that?

795
00:49:25,594 --> 00:49:28,963
Mr. Oh. Why would she take all the responsibility?

796
00:49:28,993 --> 00:49:30,904
This wouldn't have happened...

797
00:49:30,904 --> 00:49:31,963
if Mr. Lee didn't mess up in the first place.

798
00:49:31,963 --> 00:49:33,304
That's not important right now.

799
00:49:33,304 --> 00:49:35,533
She was eating candies.

800
00:49:35,533 --> 00:49:37,344
Let's figure out who to blame later.

801
00:49:37,344 --> 00:49:38,703
Let's find him first.

802
00:49:39,703 --> 00:49:41,213
- Mr. Ga. - Mr. Ga.

803
00:49:42,114 --> 00:49:43,344
Goodness.

804
00:49:45,683 --> 00:49:49,414
Sir, have you seen a man named Park Mak Doong?

805
00:49:49,884 --> 00:49:51,124
What did you say?

806
00:49:51,124 --> 00:49:53,854
Have you seen a man named Park Mak Doong?

807
00:49:54,523 --> 00:49:56,354
What are you saying?

808
00:49:57,054 --> 00:49:58,064
Thank you.

809
00:49:58,564 --> 00:50:00,894
My gosh. Darn it. What am I doing here?

810
00:50:01,493 --> 00:50:02,493
Gosh.

811
00:50:03,094 --> 00:50:04,804
Hello.

812
00:50:04,963 --> 00:50:07,933
By any chance, do you know where this man is?

813
00:50:07,933 --> 00:50:09,203
He's not at home?

814
00:50:09,203 --> 00:50:10,203
No.

815
00:50:10,374 --> 00:50:11,743
I wonder where he's gone.

816
00:50:11,743 --> 00:50:12,804
You don't know?

817
00:50:13,773 --> 00:50:15,973
No, I don't know.

818
00:50:19,644 --> 00:50:21,384
Right. I mean...

819
00:50:21,384 --> 00:50:23,513
So when did you see that old man?

820
00:50:23,513 --> 00:50:25,683
- Didn't we see him yesterday? - It was in the afternoon.

821
00:50:25,683 --> 00:50:27,324
We were hanging out here. He passed by us.

822
00:50:27,324 --> 00:50:28,554
Did he seem fine?

823
00:50:28,554 --> 00:50:29,953
- Why? - Yes, he looked fine.

824
00:50:29,953 --> 00:50:32,263
- He looked fine. Why? - Did something happen to him?

825
00:50:32,824 --> 00:50:33,923
No.

826
00:50:34,433 --> 00:50:36,094
It's not that.

827
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:42,733
Ms. Tak and I will be checking hospitals nearby.

828
00:50:47,814 --> 00:50:50,273
Was a man in his 80s transported to this hospital?

829
00:50:50,273 --> 00:50:52,683
His name is Park Mak Doong.

830
00:50:53,114 --> 00:50:55,213
- Hold on. Let me check. - Okay.

831
00:50:57,723 --> 00:50:59,554
Were you able to take down the video?

832
00:51:00,693 --> 00:51:01,794
And the account holder?

833
00:51:02,223 --> 00:51:03,693
- Listen. - Yes?

834
00:51:03,693 --> 00:51:06,523
That old man said he had a grandson.

835
00:51:06,523 --> 00:51:10,703
My gosh. No. He doesn't have a grandson.

836
00:51:11,164 --> 00:51:13,404
If he was in touch with his children,

837
00:51:13,404 --> 00:51:15,933
do you think he'd live out here all alone?

838
00:51:15,933 --> 00:51:17,943
Goodness.

839
00:51:18,943 --> 00:51:21,213
This student comes here to volunteer.

840
00:51:21,213 --> 00:51:22,874
Perhaps, he was talking about that student.

841
00:51:22,874 --> 00:51:24,644
- A volunteer student? - Yes.

842
00:51:25,683 --> 00:51:28,753
I think the student was from Sehyeong University.

843
00:51:28,753 --> 00:51:30,154
- Sehyeong University? - Yes.

844
00:51:30,154 --> 00:51:32,824
That student comes here once every two months.

845
00:51:32,824 --> 00:51:36,923
Mr. Park was especially friendly to that student.

846
00:51:36,923 --> 00:51:39,324
- I see. Sehyeong University. - Sehyeong University.

847
00:51:39,324 --> 00:51:40,523
- A volunteer student. - Okay.

848
00:51:40,664 --> 00:51:42,033
Thank you.

849
00:51:42,033 --> 00:51:43,634
- Up top. - Okay.

850
00:51:46,533 --> 00:51:48,203
Wait. Hey.

851
00:51:48,404 --> 00:51:50,374
- Yes? - Where did you get that?

852
00:51:52,344 --> 00:51:53,473
Who gave that to you?

853
00:51:54,443 --> 00:51:55,443
There.

854
00:52:00,544 --> 00:52:02,384
Hey, look. Have a drink first.

855
00:52:02,384 --> 00:52:05,223
- Mr. Park, have a drink. - I need to cook ramyeon.

856
00:52:05,223 --> 00:52:06,683
- Is that so? Okay. - Drink up.

857
00:52:06,683 --> 00:52:08,223
- Just drink. - Okay.

858
00:52:08,223 --> 00:52:09,394
Have a drink.

859
00:52:09,554 --> 00:52:10,554
Drink up.

860
00:52:10,763 --> 00:52:11,864
- Here. - Okay.

861
00:52:12,624 --> 00:52:13,624
Sir!

862
00:52:14,533 --> 00:52:15,664
My gosh.

863
00:52:16,033 --> 00:52:19,634
What are you doing here after all the mess you created?

864
00:52:19,634 --> 00:52:22,404
You're having a feast for the entire town.

865
00:52:22,574 --> 00:52:25,644
I thought something had happened to you.

866
00:52:25,644 --> 00:52:26,644
Come here.

867
00:52:29,614 --> 00:52:30,783
Where are you going?

868
00:52:31,783 --> 00:52:32,783
Sir!

869
00:52:33,243 --> 00:52:34,884
Stop there! Mr. Park!

870
00:52:36,414 --> 00:52:37,423
Sir!

871
00:53:03,273 --> 00:53:04,644
Park Mak Doong is back.

872
00:53:04,983 --> 00:53:07,243
- I'm killing him now. - What?

873
00:53:07,243 --> 00:53:08,314
What does he mean?

874
00:53:08,314 --> 00:53:10,114
(I'm killing him now.)

875
00:53:10,114 --> 00:53:12,584
He means, "Park Mak Doong is alive. I'm chasing him."

876
00:53:12,753 --> 00:53:15,394
I have to hurry. Okay.

877
00:53:15,824 --> 00:53:16,993
Hello.

878
00:53:17,723 --> 00:53:19,263
Well,

879
00:53:19,263 --> 00:53:20,693
I came here because I heard...

880
00:53:20,693 --> 00:53:23,134
the volunteer student who visits Mr. Park Mak Doong is here.

881
00:53:25,233 --> 00:53:26,334
My gosh.

882
00:53:26,463 --> 00:53:27,973
I found the person who uploaded the video.

883
00:53:27,973 --> 00:53:29,574
I'll upload the full video now.

884
00:53:51,594 --> 00:53:52,763
- Sir! - Sir!

885
00:53:53,164 --> 00:53:54,294
- Sir! - Sir!

886
00:53:54,493 --> 00:53:56,564
- Sir! - Sir!

887
00:53:56,564 --> 00:53:58,304
- Are you okay? Sir. - Are you okay?

888
00:53:58,763 --> 00:53:59,763
Sir.

889
00:54:02,374 --> 00:54:03,673
It's good.

890
00:54:08,973 --> 00:54:11,314
This is so good.

891
00:54:12,243 --> 00:54:14,414
It's so good that I almost passed out.

892
00:54:20,894 --> 00:54:22,453
I have to film this.

893
00:54:27,933 --> 00:54:29,463
- Come on. - What?

894
00:54:29,463 --> 00:54:30,763
Were we all fooled?

895
00:54:30,763 --> 00:54:31,763
He got us.

896
00:54:33,064 --> 00:54:34,064
It was a prank.

897
00:54:44,644 --> 00:54:45,814
I'll take the photo now.

898
00:54:46,743 --> 00:54:48,854
Super Spicy Chicken Ramyeon.

899
00:54:49,013 --> 00:54:50,884
- Super! - I'll take it at "super".

900
00:54:50,884 --> 00:54:51,953
- Ms. Lee. - One more.

901
00:54:51,953 --> 00:54:54,354
Super Spicy Chicken Ramyeon. Super!

902
00:54:54,693 --> 00:54:55,693
Super!

903
00:54:55,693 --> 00:54:56,693
One more.

904
00:54:56,693 --> 00:54:58,824
- Hey. - Super Spicy Chicken Ramyeon.

905
00:54:58,824 --> 00:54:59,824
Super!

906
00:55:00,064 --> 00:55:01,334
That was great.

907
00:55:02,193 --> 00:55:05,763
- My gosh. - Good job.

908
00:55:06,733 --> 00:55:09,134
So they are the ones who made the ramyeon?

909
00:55:09,134 --> 00:55:10,134
Yes.

910
00:55:10,904 --> 00:55:15,173
Oh, my. How did you come up with such a great product?

911
00:55:15,644 --> 00:55:17,983
It's the best.

912
00:55:18,644 --> 00:55:20,283
It's the best ramyeon ever!

913
00:55:28,023 --> 00:55:29,854
Wait. Is this the wrong time to be excited?

914
00:55:29,854 --> 00:55:31,094
Gosh, no.

915
00:55:32,463 --> 00:55:35,233
I'm sorry. I uploaded the video for fun.

916
00:55:35,463 --> 00:55:37,463
I didn't know it'd cause this much trouble.

917
00:55:37,463 --> 00:55:39,664
I was going to upload the full video right away.

918
00:55:40,203 --> 00:55:41,874
When things got out of control,

919
00:55:41,874 --> 00:55:43,673
I was scared to upload it.

920
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:45,344
But she told me that she'd be dead...

921
00:55:45,344 --> 00:55:46,973
- if I didn't upload the full video. - As if!

922
00:55:48,114 --> 00:55:49,574
Gosh. Don't say that.

923
00:55:50,314 --> 00:55:52,243
That was a great promotion for us.

924
00:55:52,914 --> 00:55:55,983
Well, of course, it did make us a bit anxious.

925
00:55:59,824 --> 00:56:01,723
How can we compensate for this?

926
00:56:03,453 --> 00:56:05,364
As long as your health is all right,

927
00:56:05,894 --> 00:56:10,834
we will sponsor any food product from Joonsu Food that you'd like.

928
00:56:12,834 --> 00:56:15,104
That's such great news.

929
00:56:16,673 --> 00:56:18,973
I don't need anything else.

930
00:56:19,904 --> 00:56:24,013
All I want to get is Super Spicy Chicken Ramyeon.

931
00:56:26,743 --> 00:56:27,753
Yes, sir.

932
00:56:28,814 --> 00:56:31,983
Now that we have all these precious people here,

933
00:56:32,384 --> 00:56:34,084
let's take one more picture.

934
00:56:34,084 --> 00:56:35,453
- Yes, of course. - Sure.

935
00:56:36,294 --> 00:56:38,023
- All right, come around. - Okay.

936
00:56:38,864 --> 00:56:41,094
Mr. Lee, please take a picture for us.

937
00:56:42,733 --> 00:56:44,503
- Let's take a picture. - Okay.

938
00:56:46,703 --> 00:56:47,973
Okay, come to the center.

939
00:56:48,074 --> 00:56:51,374
- Park Mak Doong. - Super!

940
00:56:51,374 --> 00:56:54,273
You covered your face. Can you lift up the ramyeon?

941
00:56:54,344 --> 00:56:57,513
Can you lift it up a little more? Park Mak Doong!

942
00:56:59,584 --> 00:57:00,783
Gosh, my knees.

943
00:57:00,783 --> 00:57:02,614
I think I ran enough to never run again for the rest of my life.

944
00:57:04,154 --> 00:57:05,884
Great work, everyone.

945
00:57:05,884 --> 00:57:09,894
Go home, get a good rest, and come to work late tomorrow.

946
00:57:10,453 --> 00:57:11,923
I'll cover for you all.

947
00:57:11,923 --> 00:57:13,094
- Goodness. - Thank you!

948
00:57:13,094 --> 00:57:15,463
I knew it, you're the best.

949
00:57:15,963 --> 00:57:18,334
The moment you showed up to the office,

950
00:57:18,334 --> 00:57:21,304
I felt so reassured that I knew everything will be okay.

951
00:57:21,304 --> 00:57:23,773
Tak's eyes and my eyes met at that moment,

952
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:25,973
and she looked like she could cry any minute now.

953
00:57:25,973 --> 00:57:28,144
I wasn't like that, Mr. Oh.

954
00:57:28,344 --> 00:57:29,374
You were like that.

955
00:57:30,773 --> 00:57:33,644
This is amazing. The view count is unbelievable.

956
00:57:33,884 --> 00:57:35,914
And the media have changed their tones too.

957

"and turned into an unexpected promotion."

960
00:57:45,394 --> 00:57:48,564
Goodness, that old man is unbelievably lucky.

961
00:57:49,433 --> 00:57:51,404
We went through a whole lot of trouble,

962
00:57:51,404 --> 00:57:53,463
but everything is well when the result is great.

963
00:57:53,834 --> 00:57:56,203
I heard that...

964
00:57:56,374 --> 00:57:59,104

one who might be born once every 100 years or something.

966
00:58:05,983 --> 00:58:10,213
Old man, what happened today will be included in your evaluation.

967
00:58:16,594 --> 00:58:19,294
Ms. Tak, did you run in those heels?

968
00:58:20,624 --> 00:58:23,594
Oh, I believe Ms. Lee's feet are probably in a bigger mess.

969
00:58:23,933 --> 00:58:24,963
What?

970
00:58:27,263 --> 00:58:28,733
- You're bleeding. - Me?

971
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:31,404
I'm fine.

972
00:58:32,273 --> 00:58:33,473
I'm seriously fine.

973
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:36,973
I'm fine. I'm okay, really.

974
00:58:38,144 --> 00:58:39,183

- Great work today. - Great work.

979
00:59:00,634 --> 00:59:01,773
How are we going to patch this up?

980

998
01:00:44,273 --> 01:00:46,703
Try one too.

999
01:00:46,703 --> 01:00:48,943
- You died so professionally. - What are you doing?

1000
01:00:49,173 --> 01:00:51,074
Come and give me a hand.

1001
01:00:51,074 --> 01:00:54,144
Great work. Have some Spicy Chicken Ramyeon.

1002
01:00:54,144 --> 01:00:55,354
Great work.

1003
01:00:55,354 --> 01:00:56,654
Hey, Hye Soo.

1004
01:00:57,683 --> 01:01:01,723
So, Hye Soo. Do you want some warm Spicy Chicken Ramyeon?

1005
01:01:01,723 --> 01:01:04,624
I told you that I don't eat ramyeon. Let's go, Mr. Kim.

1006
01:01:05,394 --> 01:01:06,993
Right, Deng Deng. Deng Deng!

1007
01:01:06,993 --> 01:01:09,864
Deng Deng, my Deng Deng! Come to Mommy.

1008
01:01:09,864 --> 01:01:13,233
Deng Deng! You're here. Come here.

1009
01:01:13,233 --> 01:01:15,503
You're so good. Goodness.

1010
01:01:15,503 --> 01:01:17,533
Come to Mommy. Come.

1011
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:20,804
What's with her?

1012
01:01:21,574 --> 01:01:22,644
Deng Deng!

1013
01:01:23,074 --> 01:01:26,044
Deng Deng! What's with you? Deng Deng!

1014
01:01:26,044 --> 01:01:28,513
Can anybody here help? Can you do something?

1015
01:01:28,513 --> 01:01:31,084
Goodness, Deng Deng. Deng Deng!

1016
01:01:31,084 --> 01:01:32,824
Can anybody here help?

1017
01:01:34,794 --> 01:01:35,824
Deng Deng.

1018
01:01:38,493 --> 01:01:39,493
- What happened? - What is it?

1019
01:01:39,493 --> 01:01:40,624
What's wrong?

1020
01:01:53,104 --> 01:01:54,404
Goodness, that's so horrible.

1021
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:02,453
Deng Deng...

1022
01:02:06,584 --> 01:02:09,993
Goodness, Deng Deng! Deng Deng.

1023
01:02:09,993 --> 01:02:11,253
It came back.

1024
01:02:11,253 --> 01:02:13,263
- Goodness, Deng Deng. - My gosh.

1025
01:02:13,923 --> 01:02:15,564
Goodness, Deng Deng. Thank you.

1026
01:02:16,033 --> 01:02:17,064
Deng Deng.

1027
01:02:35,414 --> 01:02:36,554
What happened?

1028
01:02:36,554 --> 01:02:37,584
Mr. Ga.

1029
01:02:38,423 --> 01:02:39,453
Mr. Ga!

1030
01:02:40,783 --> 01:02:41,824
Mr. Ga.

1031
01:02:42,794 --> 01:02:43,923
Stay with me!

1032
01:02:46,894 --> 01:02:49,594
Ga Yeol Chan. Yeol Chan! Hey, kid!

1033
01:02:52,334 --> 01:02:53,404
Hang in there!

1034
01:02:54,064 --> 01:02:55,134
Darn it.

1035
01:03:13,854 --> 01:03:15,094
(We thank Jung Young Ju for her special appearance.)

1036
01:03:41,883 --> 01:03:43,513
(Kkondae Intern)

1037
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:46,484
You can't bring me something that's not in a proper form.

1038
01:03:46,484 --> 01:03:48,294
You can teach me.

1039
01:03:48,294 --> 01:03:51,124
I don't know how to do this, so you can teach me.

1040
01:03:51,124 --> 01:03:53,363
Why don't I see Mr. Lee's proposal?

1041
01:03:53,363 --> 01:03:55,834
- This is mine. - I turned it in.

1042
01:03:55,834 --> 01:03:57,234
What did I do?

1043
01:03:57,234 --> 01:03:59,533
I said it's mine! It's mine!

1044
01:03:59,533 --> 01:04:01,133
What? Ransomeware?

1045
01:04:01,133 --> 01:04:03,874
Mr. Ga's computer was infected with a virus,

1046
01:04:03,874 --> 01:04:05,774
then it spread to every other one in headquarters.

1047
01:04:05,774 --> 01:04:07,444
I'll quit, then.

1048
01:04:07,444 --> 01:04:09,174
I'll take responsibility and quit my job!

1049
01:04:09,174 --> 01:04:12,044
What? You expect me to crawl back and work for him?
