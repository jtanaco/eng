1
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,353
(Episode 23)

2
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:19,077
If everything in this world
disappeared but you,

3
00:00:19,077 --> 00:00:20,565
I'm going to keep on living.

4
00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:23,726
Whatever our souls are made of...

5
00:00:23,726 --> 00:00:26,248
Your soul is the same as mine.

6
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,683
I'll be your lover forever.

7
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:00,387
You can get married to someone else.

8
00:01:00,756 --> 00:01:02,683
I don't want you
to embrace this body.

9
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:04,649
I want you to embrace my soul.

10
00:01:06,718 --> 00:01:08,011
That's not how I feel.

11
00:01:11,132 --> 00:01:13,400
Just watching you makes me happy.

12
00:01:30,776 --> 00:01:34,510
This place is
as if time has stopped.

13
00:01:34,749 --> 00:01:36,665
Why don't you pick a book,
Prosecutor?

14
00:01:36,666 --> 00:01:39,218
I'll buy you one today.

15
00:01:46,303 --> 00:01:49,935
Can I also do an experiment?

16
00:02:01,403 --> 00:02:02,539
Sa Bin.

17
00:02:05,165 --> 00:02:06,374
Jung Sa Bin.

18
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,274
Ha Eun.

19
00:02:27,195 --> 00:02:28,956
Please save Ha Eun.

20
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:17,242
I haven't...

21
00:03:18,358 --> 00:03:20,264
kept my promise yet.

22
00:03:25,928 --> 00:03:27,167
Please stop the car.

23
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:49,889
(We buy and sell old books.)

24
00:04:24,296 --> 00:04:25,311
Don't die.

25
00:04:27,866 --> 00:04:29,488
I'll get you a heart.

26
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:32,257
My promise is not...

27
00:04:33,508 --> 00:04:35,081
over yet.

28
00:04:41,355 --> 00:04:44,080
(An unfinished promise)

29
00:05:07,226 --> 00:05:09,920
Could you tell me
where Kim Su Hyuk went?

30
00:05:09,921 --> 00:05:13,466
Mr. Kim just asked me
where Mr. Ju In Do's room is.

31
00:05:13,467 --> 00:05:15,821
Everyone knows Detective Ju
as he is a long-stay patient.

32
00:05:15,822 --> 00:05:18,717
I see. In which ward is
Detective Ju staying?

33
00:05:26,828 --> 00:05:29,875
Excuse me. Detective Ju?

34
00:05:39,264 --> 00:05:40,632
It can't be.

35
00:05:40,961 --> 00:05:43,452
Did you also come back to life?

36
00:05:59,561 --> 00:06:02,738
Do you remember the owner
of this bookstore 30 years ago?

37
00:06:02,903 --> 00:06:03,743
Yes.

38
00:06:03,783 --> 00:06:04,938
Can you take a look at this?

39
00:06:11,241 --> 00:06:13,241
Yes, this is her.

40
00:06:13,654 --> 00:06:15,061
She's my friend's daughter.

41
00:06:15,429 --> 00:06:17,202
Her name was Ha Eun.

42
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,709
You said you went
to Ha Eun's funeral.

43
00:06:26,211 --> 00:06:28,436
Could you tell me
where she was buried?

44
00:06:28,953 --> 00:06:32,234
It was a natural burial site.

45
00:06:32,711 --> 00:06:34,585
My wife would know well about this.

46
00:06:34,702 --> 00:06:36,316
Please call me when you remember.

47
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:11,257
Do you know the man
who just left the bookstore?

48
00:07:12,179 --> 00:07:14,855
Right now? Do you know him?

49
00:07:18,851 --> 00:07:22,249
(Prosecutor Kim Su Hyuk.
010-1730-3033)

50
00:07:28,093 --> 00:07:29,104
Thank you.

51
00:07:34,061 --> 00:07:35,983
Is the name of the man
who shot Chun Jong Bum...

52
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:39,025
Kim Su Hyuk?

53
00:07:39,226 --> 00:07:40,278
Where are you?

54
00:07:40,802 --> 00:07:42,087
I'll tell you in person.

55
00:07:43,944 --> 00:07:47,336
I'll be at the old bookstore
at Cheonggyecheon.

56
00:08:01,668 --> 00:08:03,397
(The NFS Jung Sa Bin)

57
00:08:05,749 --> 00:08:08,122
(The NFS Jung Sa Bin)

58
00:08:09,491 --> 00:08:11,538
You had me worried.

59
00:08:11,539 --> 00:08:13,283
Why did you leave
without telling me?

60
00:08:15,671 --> 00:08:18,251
Your voice is the same.

61
00:08:18,819 --> 00:08:19,766
Sorry?

62
00:08:21,631 --> 00:08:22,798
It's nothing.

63
00:08:23,577 --> 00:08:27,131
You won't have any money since
you left your jacket and wallet.

64
00:08:27,492 --> 00:08:30,117
Wait for me. I'm going
to the bookstore to meet you.

65
00:08:30,118 --> 00:08:31,679
How do you know
I'm at the bookstore?

66
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:33,500
I heard it from Detective Ju.

67
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:37,206
He said you went to "Old Future."
Did a suspect go there?

68
00:08:56,085 --> 00:08:59,103
It never hurt this bad
since I had a heart transplant.

69
00:08:59,486 --> 00:09:00,676
What's wrong with me?

70
00:09:07,429 --> 00:09:10,335
- Are you okay?
- That's what I want to ask you.

71
00:09:10,406 --> 00:09:11,555
Are you okay?

72
00:09:38,851 --> 00:09:40,656
Take a good look
at Kim Su Hyuk.

73
00:09:42,108 --> 00:09:44,130
He's my enemy and also yours.

74
00:09:44,249 --> 00:09:46,788
The reason I saved you is
because of him.

75
00:09:46,944 --> 00:09:48,626
The bullet in your head...

76
00:09:49,281 --> 00:09:52,516
will prove that he is a prosecutor
who tried to kill a man.

77
00:09:59,374 --> 00:10:00,608
Jung Ha Eun.

78
00:10:00,827 --> 00:10:01,952
Jung Ha Eun?

79
00:10:07,929 --> 00:10:12,304
Are the hearts of lovers connected?

80
00:10:13,693 --> 00:10:17,175
At the same time
that I feel pain in my heart,

81
00:10:17,464 --> 00:10:19,464
he will feel pain too.

82
00:10:20,066 --> 00:10:23,882
It's not his mind that hurts, but
like a knife is stuck in his chest.

83
00:10:24,117 --> 00:10:25,805
That's where he feels pain.

84
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:02,414
Ji Chul.

85
00:11:04,795 --> 00:11:06,194
Gong Ji Chul.

86
00:11:07,859 --> 00:11:09,664
(One year ago)

87
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:11,114
Let me ask you again.

88
00:11:11,305 --> 00:11:12,364
What's your name?

89
00:11:13,424 --> 00:11:14,591
Gong Ji Chul.

90
00:11:15,926 --> 00:11:17,227
When were you born?

91
00:11:17,942 --> 00:11:19,647
1961.

92
00:11:20,377 --> 00:11:21,904
I was born in 1961.

93
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:24,736
On June 14th.

94
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:27,059
What year is it now?

95
00:11:27,526 --> 00:11:29,301
1987.

96
00:11:30,115 --> 00:11:31,416
And I died...

97
00:11:32,468 --> 00:11:34,103
next year.

98
00:11:35,554 --> 00:11:39,524
I think his sense of time
is disrupted due to the bullet.

99
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:41,355
He lost all his recent memory...

100
00:11:41,652 --> 00:11:43,652
and only his old memories remain.

101
00:11:43,904 --> 00:11:45,082
But...

102
00:11:45,511 --> 00:11:47,335
his name isn't Gong Ji Chul.

103
00:11:47,546 --> 00:11:48,443
It's Chun Jong Bum.

104
00:11:48,444 --> 00:11:52,371
Also, he was born in 1998,
so why would he talk about 1987?

105
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:56,842
Do you remember anyone?

106
00:11:57,455 --> 00:12:00,147
Someone I remember...

107
00:12:04,198 --> 00:12:07,269
Let's do a different test
on him today.

108
00:13:04,113 --> 00:13:05,255
What are you doing?

109
00:13:05,341 --> 00:13:07,490
We're checking his brain signal.

110
00:13:37,502 --> 00:13:41,075
He seems to have a strong memory
related to a snowfield.

111
00:13:41,526 --> 00:13:42,483
Snowfield?

112
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:54,390
The reason I was born again is...

113
00:13:55,631 --> 00:13:56,737
Jung Ha Eun.

114
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:04,413
("Secrets of a murderer")

115
00:14:10,429 --> 00:14:13,076
(The serial killer Gong Ji Chul's
last victim was a detective.)

116
00:14:31,982 --> 00:14:35,271
You need to come back right away,
if you feel nausea...

117
00:14:35,272 --> 00:14:36,868
or have problems
with your sense of space.

118
00:14:36,974 --> 00:14:40,801
If the bullet in your brain moves,
you can die any minute.

119
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:08,010
The tenth victim...

120
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:11,436
of the yellow umbrella serial
murder case who was killed in 1987.

121
00:15:11,517 --> 00:15:12,662
Her name was Cho Yoon Hee.

122
00:15:14,985 --> 00:15:17,412
One of them killed her
and the other gave her a funeral.

123
00:15:17,551 --> 00:15:18,471
No.

124
00:15:19,356 --> 00:15:21,032
One of them killed...

125
00:15:21,158 --> 00:15:22,605
and the other one drew.

126
00:15:27,947 --> 00:15:30,415
Gong Ji Chul's last target was
Ha Eun.

127
00:15:31,114 --> 00:15:34,247
If that's the case again...

128
00:15:36,782 --> 00:15:38,248
She must be
a heart transfer patient.

129
00:15:38,272 --> 00:15:41,419
The details are too accurate
for this to be a copycat crime.

130
00:15:41,748 --> 00:15:43,536
(Yoon Jung Hee, 1987
Kim Hee Soo, ?)

131
00:15:45,646 --> 00:15:47,217
(Jung Sa Bin)

132
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:51,844
The third victim of the recent
yellow umbrella case, Kim Hee Soo.

133
00:15:53,033 --> 00:15:54,885
The one who killed her...

134
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:58,267
and the one who drew her.

135
00:16:09,398 --> 00:16:12,264
The one who killed her is
now after Jung Sa Bin.

136
00:16:14,511 --> 00:16:16,511
The link between 1987...

137
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:19,599
and now is the painting.

138
00:16:20,805 --> 00:16:22,274
If I follow the painting...

139
00:16:22,703 --> 00:16:24,109
I'll find the culprit.

140
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:27,633
Let's go.

141
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,510
Why won't this come out?

142
00:16:35,677 --> 00:16:38,576
I told you to take care
of this sooner.

143
00:16:40,138 --> 00:16:41,226
What is that?

144
00:16:41,427 --> 00:16:42,561
Take a look.

145
00:16:42,858 --> 00:16:45,002
Isn't that the bones of
the dead man?

146
00:16:45,003 --> 00:16:45,914
Oh, my.

147
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:47,295
What is it?

148
00:17:45,886 --> 00:17:48,079
Find out where Doo Chul stores
his paintings.

149
00:17:48,215 --> 00:17:50,195
I'll issue a search warrant.

150

(Morning Sea Burial Forest, 68-3,

discovered...)

155

(in nearby East Sea will
be conducted.)

156
00:18:42,796 --> 00:18:45,323
The skeleton believed to belong...

157
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:48,015
to an adult was found
hanging in a net...

158
00:18:48,016 --> 00:18:50,459
at a fishing warehouse
near Gangwon-do this morning.

159
00:18:51,311 --> 00:18:54,626
While working on the net
to go fishing,

160
00:18:54,778 --> 00:18:58,384
fishermen found the remains
and reported them to the police.

161
00:18:59,019 --> 00:19:02,561
The police have searched the area
and other nets...

162
00:19:02,634 --> 00:19:06,304
and collected belongings
and 130 pieces of skeleton.

163
00:19:06,487 --> 00:19:10,842
But the cause of death and the man's
identity will take days to find out.

164
00:19:11,748 --> 00:19:15,827
The police will request an autopsy
to the NFS...

165
00:19:15,906 --> 00:19:19,169
and they will also look for
any connections to a criminal case.

166
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:20,432
I'll be going to school.

167
00:19:20,897 --> 00:19:22,387
Wait.

168
00:19:22,963 --> 00:19:24,055
I have something for you.

169
00:19:39,911 --> 00:19:42,645
I can't drive.

170
00:19:43,657 --> 00:19:45,156
What are you saying?

171
00:19:45,305 --> 00:19:47,646
You got your license as soon
as you graduated high school.

172

You can use this
to maintain your class.

174
00:19:59,986 --> 00:20:01,059
I'm...

175
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:04,996
so happy that you came back,
Jong Bum.

176
00:20:06,834 --> 00:20:07,734
Why?

177
00:20:08,561 --> 00:20:09,967
Do you not like the car?

178
00:20:11,568 --> 00:20:13,686
No way. I love it.

179
00:20:44,106 --> 00:20:46,453
If you don't remember anything,
just follow your instincts.

180
00:21:45,057 --> 00:21:46,104
Chun Jong Bum.

181
00:22:02,567 --> 00:22:03,565
Have you really ignored...

182
00:22:03,566 --> 00:22:05,600
my messages even when you
came back to Korea?

183
00:22:06,147 --> 00:22:08,499
Why are you making me upset?

184
00:22:12,447 --> 00:22:13,530
I'm so relieved.

185
00:22:14,639 --> 00:22:15,940
I really am.

186
00:22:26,527 --> 00:22:28,029
Why, you...

187
00:22:28,838 --> 00:22:30,673
How are you feeling?

188
00:22:31,497 --> 00:22:33,732
Why aren't you answering?
I asked if you were okay.

189
00:22:48,273 --> 00:22:49,405
Were you...

190
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:50,859
really worried...

191
00:22:52,547 --> 00:22:53,622
about me?

192
00:22:56,763 --> 00:22:59,766
Your first class is my lecture,
isn't it? Let's go.

193
00:23:07,073 --> 00:23:10,113
All the remains of 137 children
found in Peru were found...

194
00:23:10,114 --> 00:23:12,183
with their hearts cut out.

195
00:23:13,086 --> 00:23:16,957
The children had been offered
as religious sacrifices...

196
00:23:16,988 --> 00:23:20,758
of the Indian Chimu tribe
in northern Peru in 1450.

197
00:23:21,653 --> 00:23:24,476
It was popular
to extract the hearts then...

198
00:23:24,477 --> 00:23:26,959
so they won't come back to life.

199
00:23:27,296 --> 00:23:29,170
In ancient times
where they believed in resurrection,

200
00:23:29,171 --> 00:23:32,468
they believed that people wouldn't
come back to life without the heart.

201
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:02,575
("Resurrection" by Katyusha)

202
00:24:05,936 --> 00:24:09,215
Resurrection may seem
like nonsense these days,

203
00:24:09,285 --> 00:24:13,253
but there are cases of resurrection
in the present time.

204
00:24:13,946 --> 00:24:15,548
Shall we end today's lesson here?

205
00:24:16,726 --> 00:24:19,262
Remember to submit your reports
by next week.

206
00:24:20,966 --> 00:24:23,935
I look forward to your reports
on the virtual autopsy.

207
00:24:34,873 --> 00:24:38,049
You need to also submit
what you've been up to.

208
00:24:51,096 --> 00:24:52,015
Hello?

209
00:24:52,016 --> 00:24:54,129
There was a request for the autopsy
of some remains...

210
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:55,574
found in the East Sea.

211
00:24:55,758 --> 00:24:58,505
- Did you get the message?
- Yes. I'll be on my way right now.

212
00:25:00,277 --> 00:25:01,177
Wait a minute.

213
00:25:04,134 --> 00:25:05,375
Do you have time today?

214
00:25:06,233 --> 00:25:08,309
You still have one more
observation practice left.

215
00:25:08,399 --> 00:25:10,401
Let's consider today
as your final one.

216
00:25:11,052 --> 00:25:13,121
Today is the autopsy
of a death-row convict.

217
00:25:13,122 --> 00:25:14,090
A death-row convict?

218
00:25:14,966 --> 00:25:16,500
What's an observation practice?

219
00:25:16,501 --> 00:25:19,232
You can stop that if you're joking.
It's not funny.

220
00:25:28,864 --> 00:25:30,864
Do you want to have lunch
after the autopsy?

221
00:25:31,779 --> 00:25:32,679
Sounds good.

222
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:34,638
It's my treat.

223
00:25:35,088 --> 00:25:36,079
What would you like to have?

224
00:25:36,389 --> 00:25:38,389
The older person has
to buy a meal.

225
00:25:46,763 --> 00:25:48,464
Did you buy a car?

226
00:25:48,875 --> 00:25:49,739
What happened to your motorbike?

227
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:50,811
I don't normally...

228
00:25:51,829 --> 00:25:52,897
ride motorbikes.

229
00:25:54,068 --> 00:25:54,968
Get in.

230
00:26:10,215 --> 00:26:11,277
Jong Bum.

231
00:26:11,483 --> 00:26:13,190
How's your head?

232
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,914
Are there any problems?

233
00:26:15,967 --> 00:26:17,101
I'm fine.

234
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:23,554
Jong Bum,

235
00:26:23,958 --> 00:26:25,726
I've been worried about you.

236
00:26:26,841 --> 00:26:29,844
I couldn't sleep or eat well.

237
00:26:30,479 --> 00:26:32,112
- Why not?
- I would like...

238
00:26:32,764 --> 00:26:34,641
to apologize on behalf
of Prosecutor Kim Su Hyuk...

239
00:26:34,967 --> 00:26:36,148
about what happened...

240
00:26:36,669 --> 00:26:37,814
that day.

241
00:26:38,085 --> 00:26:39,820
Prosecutor Kim Su Hyuk?

242
00:26:41,051 --> 00:26:43,820
Why are you apologizing
instead of him?

243
00:26:44,588 --> 00:26:45,522
I just...

244
00:26:46,163 --> 00:26:47,546
wanted to.

245
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:51,559
I feel like everything happened
all because of me.

246
00:27:00,511 --> 00:27:03,014
The person is a male
with a frame of an adult.

247
00:27:03,014 --> 00:27:05,883
His bone density is lower
than that of an average person.

248
00:27:06,476 --> 00:27:09,698
His teeth show
he had a nutritional deficiency.

249
00:27:09,965 --> 00:27:14,057
The right tibia, the left, and right
hip bones seem irregular.

250
00:27:16,265 --> 00:27:18,467
This is the prisoner's number
found with the bones.

251
00:27:18,641 --> 00:27:20,198
The ink has just been restored.

252
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:23,807
The number has already been passed
to the prosecutor for review.

253
00:27:23,866 --> 00:27:25,768
We'll find his identity soon.

254
00:27:25,838 --> 00:27:26,738
Okay.

255
00:27:45,261 --> 00:27:46,596
Ribs.

256
00:27:47,297 --> 00:27:48,632
Clavicle.

257
00:27:49,138 --> 00:27:51,551
There is also an irregularity
on the lower jaw bone.

258
00:27:52,735 --> 00:27:55,241
It seems they were all fractured
during his youth,

259
00:27:55,252 --> 00:27:57,287
but he has never received
a single treatment.

260
00:27:59,238 --> 00:28:01,740
It seems he had been abused.

261
00:28:04,748 --> 00:28:06,748
He has a diagonal scar
on his orbital bone.

262
00:28:07,532 --> 00:28:09,167
Was he stabbed with a knife?

263
00:28:09,432 --> 00:28:10,666
It wasn't a knife.

264
00:28:11,737 --> 00:28:14,039
- It's probably scissors.
- How do you know that?

265
00:28:14,512 --> 00:28:15,715
I just know it.

266
00:28:16,995 --> 00:28:18,763
The attacker probably didn't
mean to kill him.

267
00:28:19,628 --> 00:28:21,263
If it was meant to kill him,

268
00:28:21,916 --> 00:28:23,346
the attacker would've stabbed
his vital points.

269
00:28:24,802 --> 00:28:26,405
It was meant to give him pain.

270
00:28:26,584 --> 00:28:28,018
I said stop crying!

271
00:28:28,019 --> 00:28:29,593
Die!

272
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:03,728
If he was a death-row convict,

273
00:29:03,863 --> 00:29:05,570
why did he die...

274
00:29:06,091 --> 00:29:07,189
by the sea?

275
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:08,825
It's because he had to meet...

276
00:29:09,723 --> 00:29:11,120
the person he loved.

277
00:29:13,677 --> 00:29:15,793
If he could only meet the woman,

278
00:29:16,683 --> 00:29:17,924
he would've risked his life...

279
00:29:18,603 --> 00:29:20,237
no matter what.

280
00:29:24,995 --> 00:29:26,229
That death-row convict...

281
00:29:27,306 --> 00:29:28,641
must've struggled to live...

282
00:29:29,956 --> 00:29:31,986
even while he was dying.

283
00:29:34,572 --> 00:29:35,740
It's because he never got...

284
00:29:37,168 --> 00:29:39,002
to tell her he loved her.

285
00:29:40,147 --> 00:29:43,047
You talk as if it's about you.

286
00:29:43,667 --> 00:29:46,370
Did you find a way
to connect with the bones?

287
00:29:46,887 --> 00:29:48,589
I'll show you...

288

All right, professor.

by my name anymore?

Right. Sa Bin.

- why you shot me?
- Why?

Right.

309

It's because you tried

Who are you?

330
00:32:55,988 --> 00:32:58,379
Do you still think Jong Bum is
the culprit?

331
00:32:58,402 --> 00:32:59,660
This has nothing to do with you,
Sa Bin.

332
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:03,171
Let's talk later, Prosecutor Kim.

333
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:10,007
Wait a minute.

334
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:13,457
Do you have something left
to say to Jong Bum?

335
00:33:34,731 --> 00:33:37,075
I found the place where Gang Du Chul
keeps the paintings.

336
00:33:37,426 --> 00:33:39,485
But someone is here.

337
00:33:55,676 --> 00:33:57,325
Why did you come here
when you haven't recovered yet?

338
00:33:57,325 --> 00:34:00,532
Are you really Detective Cha?

339
00:34:01,028 --> 00:34:04,543
Tell me the name of the criminal
we first arrested.

340
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:07,451
It's Park Sang Moon, a serial killer
who raped women.

341
00:34:07,465 --> 00:34:08,712
My gosh.

342
00:34:09,004 --> 00:34:11,831
What was the name of the rice soup
place in front of our station?

343
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:12,980
Let's go in.

344
00:34:12,996 --> 00:34:16,261
See? You're not Detective Cha.

345
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:17,823
It's "Grandmother's Rice Soup."

346
00:34:18,018 --> 00:34:19,964
You dated the second daughter
of that restaurant.

347
00:34:20,207 --> 00:34:21,058
Goodness.

348
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:23,270
Were you a detective
before you were a prosecutor?

349
00:34:23,271 --> 00:34:24,268
When was this?

350
00:34:24,364 --> 00:34:26,443
It's way before you were born.

351
00:34:26,513 --> 00:34:27,821
Wait a minute.

352
00:34:27,822 --> 00:34:29,822
Then take this.

353
00:34:30,137 --> 00:34:30,997
Here.

354
00:34:31,848 --> 00:34:33,926
You can eat this, each of you.

355
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:39,160
We used to always eat this
before arresting the criminal.

356
00:34:57,918 --> 00:35:01,213
A total of 30 pieces from Yuhon
gallery are being stored here.

357
00:35:01,214 --> 00:35:04,375
And 11 of them are a private
collection of Gang Du Chul.

358
00:35:04,507 --> 00:35:06,773
From here all the way to there...

359
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:08,992
are the pieces from Yuhon gallery.

360
00:35:08,992 --> 00:35:11,085
Please take your time
to look around.

361
00:35:18,043 --> 00:35:22,143
I brought the blue flashlight
with me.

362
00:35:34,137 --> 00:35:37,994
How come we're not getting anything,
Detective Cha?

363
00:35:37,995 --> 00:35:39,040
Let me see.

364
00:36:05,402 --> 00:36:06,916
These paintings...

365
00:36:07,496 --> 00:36:10,573
were disposed of after Ji Chul was
executed.

366
00:36:10,878 --> 00:36:12,096
How is it they're here?

367
00:36:15,199 --> 00:36:17,183
Why does Gang Du Chul have
Gong Ji Chul's paintings?

368
00:36:17,184 --> 00:36:21,031
By the way, I always wondered...

369
00:36:21,198 --> 00:36:23,480
how Gong Ji Chul could
paint these...

370
00:36:23,622 --> 00:36:25,984
when he was a middle school dropout.

371
00:36:27,489 --> 00:36:31,008
The killer 32 years ago was
Gong In Woo.

372
00:36:33,161 --> 00:36:34,843
If you want to find out the truth,

373
00:36:35,324 --> 00:36:38,647
get Gong In Woo.

374
00:36:40,465 --> 00:36:43,142
- Go and trail Gang Du Chul.
- Yes, sir.

375
00:36:49,739 --> 00:36:51,579
Detective Cha.

376
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:54,451
There's something
I need to tell you.

377
00:36:55,183 --> 00:36:58,965
The person who stabbed me
with an umbrella in the gallery...

378
00:36:59,489 --> 00:37:00,574
is a woman.

379
00:37:00,575 --> 00:37:02,805
- A woman?
- Yes.

380
00:37:03,122 --> 00:37:04,856
It wasn't a man, but a woman.

381
00:37:12,269 --> 00:37:15,241
Do you have something left
to say to Jong Bum?

382
00:37:21,762 --> 00:37:23,025
Where would you like to go?

383
00:37:24,692 --> 00:37:26,653
Do you want to go to the place
where we first met?

384
00:37:26,751 --> 00:37:27,892
The place where we first met?

385
00:37:27,919 --> 00:37:30,656
It's where you tried to sell
your book at a secondhand price.

386
00:37:30,799 --> 00:37:32,095
Where is that?

387
00:37:33,645 --> 00:37:35,186
I can't remember it well.

388
00:37:37,793 --> 00:37:39,347
You'll remember when you get there.

389
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:42,121
You scribbled on the book
with a fountain pen.

390
00:37:43,543 --> 00:37:46,707
I'm only telling you now,
but you were very memorable.

391
00:37:46,771 --> 00:37:48,502
You were quite dashing.

392
00:37:52,644 --> 00:37:54,511
("The eye...")

393
00:38:01,956 --> 00:38:03,762
("The eye shall see
for the last time.")

394
00:38:08,075 --> 00:38:10,672
I guess I like to scribble
with a fountain pen.

395
00:38:12,144 --> 00:38:13,583
So where is this place?

396
00:38:16,676 --> 00:38:19,255
Well, it's...

397
00:38:20,762 --> 00:38:22,150
Go straight for now.

398
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:30,479
I'd like to ask you something.

399
00:38:32,997 --> 00:38:35,030
When I was shot in the head,

400
00:38:35,606 --> 00:38:39,043
why were you in that place?

401
00:38:42,769 --> 00:38:45,154
I want to hear
about what happened that day.

402
00:38:45,871 --> 00:38:47,399
I want to hear it from you,

403
00:38:48,251 --> 00:38:51,080
not anyone else, Sa Bin.

404
00:38:54,012 --> 00:38:55,810
I got a text message.

405
00:38:56,441 --> 00:38:59,596
It said you might commit murder.

406
00:39:03,247 --> 00:39:05,304
Did I try to kill you?

407
00:39:05,996 --> 00:39:06,909
No.

408
00:39:07,832 --> 00:39:10,850
You tried to save me.

409
00:39:23,436 --> 00:39:25,107
(This month's best-seller)

410
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:31,977
This book is about Gong Ji Chul
as a serial killer.

411
00:39:33,364 --> 00:39:37,272
Gong Ji Chul is the first person
my dad executed as a prison officer.

412
00:39:37,372 --> 00:39:38,422
A prison officer?

413
00:39:39,753 --> 00:39:41,236
What is the name of your father?

414
00:39:41,699 --> 00:39:42,749
My dad?

415
00:39:42,952 --> 00:39:44,735
It's Jung Sung Eun.

416
00:39:45,746 --> 00:39:46,817
Jung Sung Eun?

417
00:40:03,355 --> 00:40:04,933
I sometimes wonder...

418
00:40:05,059 --> 00:40:08,823
whether Gong Ji Chul could
get redemption.

419
00:40:17,714 --> 00:40:19,104
He'd want to.

420
00:40:20,012 --> 00:40:21,863
Gong Ji Chul is also a human being.

421
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:26,374
But do you think Gong Ji Chul
in this book...

422
00:40:27,237 --> 00:40:28,851
is who he really is?

423
00:40:29,317 --> 00:40:30,072
Sorry?

424
00:40:30,168 --> 00:40:32,266
He could've been a death-row convict
who was falsely accused.

425
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:34,778
The dead can't talk about it...

426
00:40:35,559 --> 00:40:37,213
just like the remains
of that death-row convict.

427
00:40:37,886 --> 00:40:38,790
You're right.

428
00:40:39,333 --> 00:40:41,535
There might be death-row convicts
who were falsely accused...

429
00:40:42,269 --> 00:40:44,716
but Gong Ji Chul is not one of them.

430
00:40:46,114 --> 00:40:49,360
He's an evil one my dad witnessed
with his own eyes.

431
00:40:50,538 --> 00:40:51,312
An evil?

432
00:40:57,238 --> 00:41:00,603
The remains of the death-row convict
can't be identified by the police.

433
00:41:02,551 --> 00:41:03,479
Hold on.

434
00:41:06,497 --> 00:41:09,632
Jae Yi, can we restore a face?

435
00:41:09,681 --> 00:41:10,846
Who is it this time?

436
00:41:11,105 --> 00:41:13,318
It's an unidentified
death-row convict.

437
00:41:13,362 --> 00:41:15,228
A death-row convict? Okay.

438
00:41:15,324 --> 00:41:18,020
- Let's meet at the autopsy lab.
- I'll be there.

439
00:41:19,221 --> 00:41:21,921
It seems like I have to go back
to the NFS.

440
00:41:21,999 --> 00:41:23,341
I'll give you a ride.

441
00:41:56,056 --> 00:41:57,860
Do you know the address
of Jang Hye Mi?

442
00:41:58,963 --> 00:42:00,622
The author of
"Secrets of a murderer".

443
00:42:00,623 --> 00:42:02,524
Of course, but why do you need it?

444
00:42:02,628 --> 00:42:04,628
I have something to tell her
that I've held for 30 years.

445
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:17,696
It's 28-1, Jangan-ro,
Jung-Gu, Seoul.

446
00:42:20,102 --> 00:42:21,881
("Secrets of a murderer")

447
00:42:52,526 --> 00:42:53,600
You're amazing.

448
00:42:53,883 --> 00:42:55,385
People will think...

449
00:42:55,458 --> 00:42:58,374
you lost weight
after going through so much...

450
00:42:58,427 --> 00:43:00,427
with my engagement falling apart.

451
00:43:03,969 --> 00:43:05,913
Will my going through your hardship
with you...

452
00:43:06,299 --> 00:43:07,830
change your engagement?

453
00:43:14,776 --> 00:43:16,777
Maybe you should use this chance
to lose a few kilos.

454
00:43:32,888 --> 00:43:34,812
What brings you here without notice?

455
00:43:35,621 --> 00:43:37,322
I heard you went to America.

456
00:43:37,471 --> 00:43:38,982
Were you in Korea?

457
00:43:45,489 --> 00:43:47,203
Sang Ah, go to your room.

458
00:43:47,615 --> 00:43:49,182
He's my guest.

459
00:43:55,395 --> 00:43:56,358
Have a seat.

460
00:43:56,803 --> 00:43:57,992
Do you want some tea?

461
00:43:58,328 --> 00:43:59,841
Why did you lie to me?

462
00:44:03,323 --> 00:44:05,240
Your tone got rough.

463
00:44:05,241 --> 00:44:06,589
The one who killed
all the women...

464
00:44:07,055 --> 00:44:08,190
was Gong In Woo.

465
00:44:10,425 --> 00:44:11,533
Gong In Woo...

466
00:44:14,454 --> 00:44:17,266
You can't ever know that name,
Jong Bum.

467
00:44:20,033 --> 00:44:21,704
Where did you hear that from?

468
00:44:22,437 --> 00:44:24,884
Tell me. Why did you lie to me?

469
00:44:27,792 --> 00:44:29,468
I don't know.

470
00:44:30,346 --> 00:44:34,572
A piece of writing is always between
reality and fiction.

471
00:44:35,857 --> 00:44:37,027
Could you tell me?

472
00:44:38,621 --> 00:44:40,222
From where to where...

473
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:42,879
do you think is a lie?

474
00:44:48,132 --> 00:44:50,332
That address you gave me
32 years ago.

475
00:44:51,016 --> 00:44:52,882
The hospital that Ha Eun
was supposed to be in.

476
00:44:54,069 --> 00:44:55,704
That wasn't where Ha Eun was.

477
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:57,751
That was where I was going to die.

478
00:45:22,116 --> 00:45:23,532
Your eyes...

479
00:45:26,217 --> 00:45:27,784
are not Jong Bum's.

480
00:45:29,618 --> 00:45:31,336
His eyes are closed.

481
00:45:33,244 --> 00:45:35,244
I can't read any emotion from them.

482
00:45:36,189 --> 00:45:37,368
But your eyes are...

483
00:45:38,638 --> 00:45:41,617
like those of an untamed animal.

484
00:45:43,333 --> 00:45:44,255
I tend to...

485
00:45:45,474 --> 00:45:48,733
believe in those that the human
intellect cannot understand.

486
00:45:50,421 --> 00:45:52,984
And the person in front of me is...

487
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:55,731
quite interesting.

488
00:46:00,555 --> 00:46:03,302
Long time no see, Ji Chul.

489
00:46:08,644 --> 00:46:10,446
You wouldn't have met her anyway.

490
00:46:11,947 --> 00:46:13,816
The one you were trying to see,
Jung Ha Eun.

491
00:46:16,073 --> 00:46:17,816
She was already dead back then.

492
00:46:21,298 --> 00:46:22,225
What?

493
00:46:24,294 --> 00:46:25,224
She was dead?

494
00:46:33,697 --> 00:46:36,873
Do you know where
your stepfather is buried?

495
00:46:38,965 --> 00:46:39,955
Because I do.

496
00:46:40,823 --> 00:46:42,144
I was there.

497
00:46:43,445 --> 00:46:45,445
I was there when In Woo killed
your stepfather.

498
00:46:46,815 --> 00:46:49,151
Do you want his body to come out?

499
00:46:50,378 --> 00:46:52,588
Then the world would know
that it was...

500
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:55,591
Jang Hye Mi who helped
Gong In Woo commit a murder.

501
00:46:57,236 --> 00:46:58,402
Then your book will be...

502
00:46:59,486 --> 00:47:01,534
used as proof of your sin.

503
00:47:01,710 --> 00:47:04,870
It was a woman who helped
Ji Chul escape.

504
00:47:05,078 --> 00:47:06,219
That woman...

505
00:47:06,735 --> 00:47:09,872
worshipped Ji Chul who killed
her stepfather,

506
00:47:10,285 --> 00:47:12,285
who had been raping her.

507
00:47:14,133 --> 00:47:15,045
Why...

508
00:47:16,941 --> 00:47:18,714
did you come to me?

509
00:47:19,408 --> 00:47:21,684
Bring Gong In Woo to me.

510
00:47:22,247 --> 00:47:23,185
Right now.

511
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:25,511
If you ignore me...

512
00:47:26,266 --> 00:47:27,556
you'll see your stepfather...

513
00:47:29,391 --> 00:47:30,719
on the news.

514
00:47:35,464 --> 00:47:37,464
Who will believe...

515
00:47:38,634 --> 00:47:41,704
that a 23-year-old medical student
is a witness to a murder...

516
00:47:43,072 --> 00:47:44,206
that happened 32 years ago?

517
00:47:45,241 --> 00:47:46,734
What do you think I found...

518
00:47:48,075 --> 00:47:49,578
where your stepfather was buried?

519
00:47:51,573 --> 00:47:54,116
Bring Gong In Woo to me.

520
00:48:07,733 --> 00:48:09,952
("Secrets of a murderer")

521
00:48:21,492 --> 00:48:24,038
That woman was Ji Chul's woman.

522
00:48:24,884 --> 00:48:26,470
In her stomach...

523
00:48:27,569 --> 00:48:30,319
the child of Ji Chul was growing.

524
00:48:32,433 --> 00:48:34,433
Then the world would know
that it was...

525
00:48:35,016 --> 00:48:37,238
Jang Hye Mi who helped
Gong In Woo commit a murder.

526
00:48:39,071 --> 00:48:40,285
Then your book will be...

527
00:48:41,457 --> 00:48:43,459
used as proof of your sin.

528
00:49:10,431 --> 00:49:11,377
Sir.

529
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:14,530
There's someone you have to meet.

530
00:49:15,685 --> 00:49:17,099
You'll have to come in.

531
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:22,386
Yes, I'll meet you there.

532
00:49:26,744 --> 00:49:29,211
Tomorrow, 10 p.m. Yuhon Gallery.

533
00:49:29,966 --> 00:49:33,784
You'll meet Gong In Woo there.

534
00:49:37,619 --> 00:49:39,619
You have a twisted destiny too.

535
00:49:56,986 --> 00:49:58,601
(Tomorrow, 10 p.m. Yuhon Gallery.
You'll meet Gong In Woo there.)

536
00:50:10,562 --> 00:50:14,223
Even though he was a death-row
convict, I'm sure he had a family.

537
00:50:15,022 --> 00:50:17,612
No, this man was...

538
00:50:17,777 --> 00:50:19,595
abused as a child.

539
00:50:20,264 --> 00:50:22,134
There might not be anyone
looking for him.

540
00:50:22,316 --> 00:50:24,316
Do we have to restore his face?

541
00:50:24,735 --> 00:50:26,362
When there's no one looking for him.

542
00:50:27,429 --> 00:50:29,972
I want to at least put his face
on his urn.

543
00:50:30,502 --> 00:50:33,175
At least I could remember him.

544
00:50:33,523 --> 00:50:34,676
This death-row convict.

545
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:41,617
I found the owner of
the Donggang mummy's ring.

546
00:50:43,861 --> 00:50:45,450
A natural burial site?

547
00:51:09,528 --> 00:51:11,998
It would've been better if they
had met when they were alive.

548
00:51:12,195 --> 00:51:13,696
I'll bring the ring.

549
00:51:14,499 --> 00:51:16,499
It's the day that Donggang mummy
gets married.

550
00:51:17,861 --> 00:51:19,362
It's his wedding date,

551
00:51:19,387 --> 00:51:21,323
and I hope the weather will be nice.

552
00:51:51,468 --> 00:51:53,964
(Please bury Hyung Bin here with me
when his body is found.)

553
00:51:53,965 --> 00:51:55,020
(Jung Ha Eun)

554
00:51:58,679 --> 00:52:02,716
Please bury Hyung Bin here with me
when his body is found.

555
00:52:02,717 --> 00:52:03,652
Ha Eun.

556
00:52:05,782 --> 00:52:07,223
I came here too late, didn't I?

557
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:52,312
I'm so sorry it took a while.

558
00:52:54,253 --> 00:52:55,621
I'm sorry I'm late.

559
00:53:02,425 --> 00:53:05,292
It looks like
you're the one getting married.

560
00:53:11,346 --> 00:53:12,656
Prosecutor Kim,

561
00:53:12,839 --> 00:53:13,807
what's the matter?

562
00:53:14,981 --> 00:53:17,327
Did you bring the ring?

563
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:18,979
Yes.

564
00:53:42,394 --> 00:53:44,430
April 3, 1983 was the date...

565
00:53:46,322 --> 00:53:47,824
when they first met.

566
00:53:48,737 --> 00:53:49,637
Pardon?

567
00:53:50,186 --> 00:53:51,987
How do you know that?

568
00:54:11,016 --> 00:54:11,917
They found...

569
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,349
each other at last, didn't they?

570
00:54:21,145 --> 00:54:23,080
They'll be together from now on.

571
00:54:27,843 --> 00:54:29,211
They won't be separated.

572
00:54:31,334 --> 00:54:34,003
He must've wanted to keep
his promise to his loved one.

573
00:54:35,354 --> 00:54:37,442
That's why his body didn't rot
as he was waiting...

574
00:54:39,332 --> 00:54:41,001
for her to reach out to him.

575
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:54,814
Sir,

576
00:55:54,892 --> 00:55:58,095
the pervert Gang Du Chul is
finally on the move.

577
00:55:58,623 --> 00:56:00,563
He's picking someone up
from the Incheon Port.

578
00:56:02,526 --> 00:56:04,194
Stick close to him. I'm on my way.

579
00:56:10,609 --> 00:56:12,210
He's on his way.

580
00:56:12,812 --> 00:56:14,314
I've got something to ask.

581
00:56:16,655 --> 00:56:18,323
What are you planning to do...

582
00:56:19,059 --> 00:56:20,460
when you meet your father?

583
00:56:22,292 --> 00:56:23,960
I'm going to wash away my sins.

584
00:56:25,058 --> 00:56:26,025
How?

585
00:56:26,374 --> 00:56:27,842
I'll make him...

586
00:56:28,862 --> 00:56:30,163
confess his own sins.

587
00:56:49,953 --> 00:56:51,254
Gong Ji Chul.

588
00:56:52,329 --> 00:56:54,397
Today is the day you're dying
for the second time.

589
00:56:59,179 --> 00:57:00,948
I'm chasing after him,

590
00:57:01,593 --> 00:57:03,604
but this is the way
to the Yuhon Gallery.

591
00:57:03,605 --> 00:57:05,173
How does the fellow passenger
look like?

592
00:57:05,195 --> 00:57:07,698
I can't see it
because it's dark inside the car.

593
00:57:07,716 --> 00:57:08,817
Stick close to them.

594
00:57:23,225 --> 00:57:24,653
(Chun Jong Bum)

595
00:57:25,793 --> 00:57:27,972
I don't have any time
to deal with you right now.

596
00:57:35,667 --> 00:57:37,769
Come see Gong In Woo for yourself...

597
00:57:38,499 --> 00:57:40,172
at 11 o'clock in Yuhon Gallery.

598
00:58:12,206 --> 00:58:13,741
I lost Gang Du Chul.

599
00:58:19,233 --> 00:58:20,634
I found him.

600
00:59:02,356 --> 00:59:03,973
(Born Again)

601
00:59:04,109 --> 00:59:05,890
What's your relationship
with Gong In Woo?

602
00:59:05,891 --> 00:59:07,504
Just be evil by yourself.

603
00:59:07,505 --> 00:59:09,027
Why are you bringing me
into this?

604
00:59:09,028 --> 00:59:11,173
Am I the next target
after Gong In Woo?

605
00:59:11,373 --> 00:59:14,345
What's the secret of the real killer
that you missed in your book?

606
00:59:14,370 --> 00:59:16,898
Remember that I'm the only one
who can reveal...

607
00:59:16,898 --> 00:59:18,399
that you're not the killer.

608
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:20,637
I restored the death-row convict's
remains. Don't they look alike?

609
00:59:20,638 --> 00:59:23,971
I only realized it today
that the deity gave me a chance.

610
00:59:23,972 --> 00:59:25,306
I'll say it one by one,

611
00:59:25,306 --> 00:59:27,160
but only to Prosecutor Kim Su Hyuk.

612
00:59:27,403 --> 00:59:29,444
I had a nightmare
that you were shot again.

613
00:59:29,444 --> 00:59:31,106
My head is hurting so much.

614
00:59:31,558 --> 00:59:32,726
Can you come?
