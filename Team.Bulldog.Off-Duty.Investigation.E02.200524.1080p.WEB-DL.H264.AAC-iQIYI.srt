165
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:09,705
I couldn't even film anything.

166

167
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,985
- Do you think I wanted to tank it?
- Well, that's what you did.

168

Look at you.

169
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:19,219
You never listen to anything we say on TV.

170

And I did all the work for you,
but you just ruined everything.

171
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:26,055
Why do you think I stepped up
and tried to catch him myself?

172
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,495
You make it sound like
you had a huge sense of duty.

173
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,365
- But you only did it for your ratings.

That's just what follows along.

175
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,209
My main purpose was to create
a just society.

176
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:38,839
Leave that to us. That's our job.

177
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,879
You should just focus on the ratings.

178
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,579
You even said you owed me
when we met in front of the NFS.

179

Didn't the documents say
the two unidentified fingerprints

180
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,019
from the two murder cases are a match?

181
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:51,589
Then you just had to compare them
with his fingerprints.

182
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:55,185
If they were a match,
he wouldn't have gotten released.

183
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:58,495

- Do you get it now?

184

to know so much about the case?

189

I don't know. I think it was Fact Bomb
or something.

190
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:21,945
I guess that's why she was going on and on
like she was bombing us.

191

Oh, right. The section chief
wants to meet in the chief's office.

This guy coming out of the club

322
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:37,145
isn't Kim Min-seok. It's Kim Min-soo.
You know?

323
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,349
Is there something there?

324
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:42,415
Why do you keep watching the same part?

325
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,515
What?

326
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:47,715
I knew it.

327
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,499
- Kim Min-soo, you'd better wait for me.
- What?

328
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,755
Did you make plans to meet him?

329
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:57,125
Hey, I'm talking to myself.

330
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:58,965
To use a technical term, it's a monologue.

331
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,365
My goodness.

332
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,605
[ I couldn't throw out
my son's belongings. ]

333
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:11,975
[ - You can't be here.
- Wait. ]

334
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,079
[ Who are you? ]

335
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,649
[ - Is that why you killed him?
- No. ]

336
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:19,459
My goodness. I got his bottom.
That lousy cop.

337
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:21,429
Why did he have to sit down right then?

338
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:23,289
I can't believe this guy.

339
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:24,929
Why did you crouch down there?

340
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:27,855
Come on, he ruined the audio track too.

341
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,199
Why haven't you reported a new topic?

342
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,669
Don't tell me this week's episode is...

343
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:34,269
No. No way.

344
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:36,009
You'll be surprised when you watch it.

345
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:38,775
What? What did he do with his bottom?
Why would I be surprised?

346
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,175
You saw it.

347
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:46,845
This is too bad, you know.

348
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:49,449
I think this will surprise you
more than me.

349
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:50,389
What is it?

350
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:52,889
Your junior, Director Hong,
brought a proposal for a new pilot show.

351
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:55,689
Goodness, I've never seen that kind
of format before.

352
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:57,585
It's bound to be a hit.

353
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,395
All right. Keep wasting your energy here.

354
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,565
My gosh, that sly geezer!

355
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:10,535
I'm going to get the highest ratings.

356
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,275
Darn it.

357
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,905
What is it?

358
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,575
Moo-young, someone is here to see you.

359
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,075
[ "The Bible" ]

360
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,929
Hey. What's wrong with you?

361
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:33,899
Are you a hybrid Buddhist-Catholic?

362
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,899
If you keep this up, believers of
both religions will stone you.

363
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:40,069
On my way to the temple,
I met an old priest.

364
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:41,335
What's wrong with him?

365
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:44,539
I'll skip my long story.
You should make a donation.

366
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,609
As if.

367
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:47,279
Why? You're dressed like a priest.

368
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,245
Right.

369
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:51,779
- How about an offertory?
- What kind of priest pays a home visit...

370
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:54,019
I mean, a personal visit
to collect donations?

371
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:57,815
Based on that, you think of the TV station
as your home.

372
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:00,355
That must be why you exposed me,
your only brother, on TV.

373
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,755
And that's why I'm broke.

374
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:04,895
I see.

375
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:08,029
Hey, I don't have cash.

376
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:09,095
Sister.

377
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:12,695
What will you do
with your mobile banking app?

378
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:19,235
How much?

379
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,249
Let me tell you
that my balance is 320 dollars.

380
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:22,745
Just give me 320 dollars.

381
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,089
[ I analyzed the culprit as a profiler. ]

382
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:32,959
[ And a significant part of my analysis
matches Kim Min-soo. ]

383
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,289
[ I found out that
the culprit was left-handed. ]

384
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:37,189
[ All right. This is a painting
by Kim Min-soo. ]

385
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:39,225
[ It's called "Cross Section of Death". ]

386
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:42,029
[ As you can see,
the direction of the brush strokes ]

387
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:43,969
[ goes from left to right evenly. ]

388
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:46,335
[ This means that he's left-handed,
just like the culprit. ]

389
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,105
What do you think? Can you see it?

390
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:52,939
It kind of got weak in the end.
I'm not sure.

391
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:56,049
We're not cops.
We can get it started first.

392
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:58,919
It's a reasonable doubt.
And it's up to the viewers to decide.

393
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,119
In our industry,
getting the scoop first is important.

394
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,415
But, Ms. Kang,

395
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:04,519
a lot of people are left-handed.

396
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,859
To say there's a reasonable doubt
with this,

397
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:08,589
isn't it unreasonable?

398
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:10,829
Why not?
We have his nickname and IP address.

399
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:12,959
"It was stolen. I was hacked."
If he says that,

400
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,329
we have no rebuttal.

401
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:15,869
She has a point.

402
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:17,569
Besides, this is Ido Pharmaceuticals.

403
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:19,669
If we make claims
without any hard evidence,

404
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:22,369
they might sue us.
Gosh, that will be a hassle.

405
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:24,339
My gosh, you and your words.

406
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:25,879
Mr. Never-Had-A-Girlfriend.

407
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,575
How can you launch your own show
if you're such a coward?

408
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:31,179
Last month, you aired an episode
that AX Group rigged stock prices

409
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,815
to succeed the management rights.

410
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,649
And AX Group filed a lawsuit.

411
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:36,815
Your trial against them is still ongoing.

412
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:38,989
I should have stopped you to the end.

413
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:40,159
It's all right.

414
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,929
I would've done it
even if you didn't approve.

415
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:43,225
Why bring that up?

416
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,599
What about you?

417
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,765
We definitely need more than this
to narrate a story.

418
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:51,265
Do we have any visual materials
that could shock the viewers?

419
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:53,199
So far, we only have suspicions.

420
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,839
Something shocking

421
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:58,805
that would make the viewers believe
that he really is the culprit.

422
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:02,245
Visual materials that
would be shocking to the viewers?

423
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:07,275
Let me see.

424
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:17,955
I might be able to find it.

425
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:35,695
I'm so thirsty.

426
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:43,265
Hey, Dae-jin.

427
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:45,335
Are you sure Kim Min-soo is home?

428
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:48,479
Yes, he's home according
to his cellphone signal.

429
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,275
But how come he never comes out
once all day?

430
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:53,575
Don't you think he left his phone at home?

431
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,915
[ You said the basic rules of investigation
are determination and persistence. ]

432
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:00,115
Then a stakeout is
like the highlight of investigations.

433
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:02,415
- Detective Min.
- Yes, coming.

434
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:06,685
I hope you become the highlight
of determination and persistence.

435
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:12,165
My goodness.

436
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:15,565
That is some annoying support.

437
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:17,565
Darn it.

438
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:23,135
What? What's that?

439
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:25,545
What?

440
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:39,185
Excuse me, ma'am.

441
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,425
Why are you covering your face?

442
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:48,639
- Do I know you?
- No, I don't know you.

443
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,365
You can just keep going.

444
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,635
What's wrong with her?

445
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:56,575
What are you modifying your voice for?

446
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:01,715
What? Director Kang?

447
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,375
Just pretend you didn't see me.
It'll be over soon.

448
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:05,885
Look at her.

449
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:09,185
You must know that this is illegal, right?

450
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:12,659
Where did you get this tall ladder though?

451
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:14,589
I borrowed it from the construction site
over there.

452
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:16,025
You think I stole it?

453
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:17,255
Okay.

454
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:20,495
You're filming here illegally
without permission.

455
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:23,169
I got you. As a guardian of the law,

456
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:26,065
I will make you pay for your actions.

457
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:28,505
Gosh, it's Kim Min-soo.

458
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,175
Hide!

459
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,155
Forget it.

460
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,325
Fine, then.

461
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:57,965
- Darn it.
- Gosh.

462
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,965
You just did that on purpose, didn't you?

463
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:05,405
So, that's Kim Min-soo?

464
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:07,505
He's the twin brother of Kim Min-seok.

465
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:11,719
No way. That's Kim Min-seok.

466
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,515
How can you tell which one is which?

467
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:15,885
My scientific gut is telling me.

468
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:19,325
I haven't just been slacking off as a cop,
you know.

469
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:21,529
How can your gut feeling be scientific?
You're joking.

470
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:22,695
Hey, one second.

471
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:26,329
- There. That guy who just came out.
- Where?

472
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:28,535
That's Kim Min-soo. Record it now.

473
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:31,465
On what grounds are you saying that?

474
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,305
Let's go.

475
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:41,575
Who's there?

476
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,075
Who is it?

477
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:48,485
What in the world...

478
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:52,355
It's just a horse.

479
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:57,425
A horse? Hey, wait!

480
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,499
- Hey, there's someone out there!
- Gosh.

481
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,999
Are you crazy? You're insane. You must be.

482
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,635
How can you think to mimic a horse
right then and there?

483
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:07,239
And why are you so good at it?

484
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,105
I was so startled that it just came out.

485
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:12,905
- Let's hurry and run.
- Gosh, I was so shocked.

486
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:15,945
What were you thinking, seriously?

487
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:19,485
- Hey, hey.
- My goodness.

488
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,155
- Hey, go!
- What's wrong?

489
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,619
- Who are you?
- Why are you getting in this car?

490
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:28,295
Mine is over there.
Let's just go first. Drive.

491
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:30,095
Hey!

492
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:44,539
Who are you anyway?

493
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:46,545
- Hey, you don't need to know.
- Okay.

494
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:53,145
This is that shared car
from the other day, right?

495
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:56,685
You're overspending
when you're on a budget.

496
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,789
I needed it to investigate the story.

497
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:01,089
What? Then should I drive
a lousy car to Guchon

498
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:02,625
when it would only stand out?

499
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:04,095
I'm just saying.

500
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:07,325
Let me have your number.

501
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,665
What's with you? It's not what you think.

502
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:16,935
- Excuse me, I have a boyfriend.
- She doesn't.

503
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:20,275
- Hey.
- I get that you don't have one.

504
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:23,715
Just share the video of Kim Min-soo
that you filmed earlier with me.

505
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,745
Why should I?
Are you trying to steal this too?

506
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:31,625
I've filmed you filming illegally,
all right?

507
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:33,985
So? Should I issue a warrant?

508
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,125
Is this a threat?

509
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,095
It's called a negotiation.

510
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,939
I can tell that he's a cop.

511
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,435
Why don't you just share it?

512
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,345
There.

513
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:05,185
I sent you my email address,
so please make it quick.

514
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:08,625
Now, please drop me off over there.

515
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:10,925
And take care, Pony.

516
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,575
- Let me off, please.
- Gosh.

517
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,305
Good work.

518
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:28,475
He's a total thief.

519
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:38,355
So this is the solid proof that the guy
who followed Gu Hyeong-jin

520
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:41,225
at the club was not Kim Min-seok
but Kim Min-soo.

521
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,855
That's what you're saying?

522
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:46,929
The gap between each individual's shoulder
and pelvis is different.

523
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:49,599
So is their stride and joint movement.

524
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,935
We can analyze such data
to find out the real culprit.

525
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:56,809
You can see the example
of the circumduction gait here.

526
00:30:56,810 --> 00:30:59,705
Both of these guys kick their left legs
while walking.

527
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:02,375
And the right foot is an out-toed gait.

528
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:04,349
It means the right foot points outward.

529
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:07,745
It is extremely rare
that these two cases show in one person.

530
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:12,725
Which means, it's highly likely
that these two are the same person.

531
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:15,595
Seriously, that's amazing.
How did you figure this out?

532
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:18,295
It's not that I analyzed it
so scientifically...

533
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:21,939
This is what years of experience
looks like, you know.

534
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,195
Look up to me all you want.

535
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,709
Oh, right. We should report it
to the section chief.

536
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:27,835
No, don't.

537
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:30,279
Why not? We have the perfect evidence.

538
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:33,105
What if he says he only followed him
but didn't murder him?

539
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:36,845
Let me make sure of one more thing.

540
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:43,085
Okay, let's compare these two photos.

541
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,259
This mansion that belongs to Kim Min-seok

542
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:48,799
was owned by three generations
of Ido Pharmaceuticals owners.

543
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,595
Look at this place in the video.

544
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:52,925
What do you think? It's the same, right?

545
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:55,539
Is this the perfect evidence or what?

546
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,969
Now, he can't say

547
00:31:57,970 --> 00:32:00,105
- his IP was hacked or stolen.
- Exactly.

548
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:02,479
The dirty secret of the twins
of Ido Pharmaceuticals.

549
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,979
That'll work.

550
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:07,479
I knew it, Director Kang.
You nailed it eventually.

551
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,815
No, no. There's something more important.

552
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:13,945
All right. These two men
who were at Kim Min-seok's house.

553
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:15,315
Doesn't one of them

554
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:17,485
look familiar to you?

555
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:20,425
I think we might have interviewed him.

556
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:24,295
Isn't that Kang Pil-du,
the Director of KFDA?

557
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,165
We interviewed him
for the humidifier case before.

558
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:29,895
He was a professor
of Pharmaceutical Sciences back then.

559
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:33,409
Right, he lied that there was no issue
with the product.

560
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:34,505
Bingo.

561
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:37,639
It's three days before Ido's new drug
gets approved by the KFDA.

562
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,879
And the Director
of Ido Pharmaceuticals secretly met

563
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,375
with the Director of KFDA at his home.

564
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:45,519
The time and place seem suspicious, right?

565
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:48,685
That's enough for reasonable doubt.

566
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:51,055
But that man

567
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:54,525
always sues people. Will it be okay?

568
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:56,459
Goodness, that's fine.

569
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:59,165
Let's put it out there
and worry about it later.

570
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:01,699
Those two men could be our key.

571
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:04,495
So please dig up some dirt
on them quickly.

572
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,109
Hey, I'll go and interview Kim Min-soo,

573
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:09,609
so you go ahead and meet with the victims
of the new drug test.

574
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:11,479
There's got to be something.

575
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,975
- Yes, sure.
- Gosh, you get on my nerves.

576
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,075
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

577
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:26,185
Okay.

578
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:35,095
[ Mom ]

579
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:37,995
Mom, please stop calling.

580
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,035
He already got 320 dollars from me.

581
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:45,745
My gosh!

582
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:49,345
What are you doing here?

583
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,179
How did you know I'd get off here?

584
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:53,889
It looks like you're off
to Kim Min-soo's house.

585
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:55,045
What?

586
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,255
Did you wiretap me or something?

587
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,929
How did you know? Tell me.

588
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:03,829
You weren't calling me,

589
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:05,769
so that had to mean you found something.

590
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:08,765
And I figured you'll go see him
to do the prepping.

591
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:11,139
You're exactly correct.

592
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:12,835
It's as if you scanned my brain.

593
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,609
Let me go with you.
This might be the last time I see him,

594
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:17,275
so I want to go, too.

595
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,875
Is that really necessary?

596
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:21,475
I also solved the puzzle.

597
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:25,315
The mystery behind
the unidentified fingerprints.

598
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,154
What?

599
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:40,029
Seriously? What are you guys doing here?

600
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:41,525
That's what I want to ask.

601
00:34:41,869 --> 00:34:43,799
I have to ask him something first.

602
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,665
So count to 100 before you come in.

603
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:47,435
Where are you going?

604
00:34:47,869 --> 00:34:49,505
We get to ask him first this time.

605
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:52,075
Really? Do you have something?

606
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:53,975
I'm not going to tell you.

607
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:56,819
And just go home
if you're going to tank it like last time.

608
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:57,919
Don't get in our way.

609
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,319
Gosh, why would I get in your way?

610
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,615
I know you worked really hard
to get this far.

611
00:35:03,789 --> 00:35:04,959
Make sure you film this

612
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,755
if you don't want me
to beat you to it again.

613
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:27,709
All the paintings in the gallery

614
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:30,249
were painted by my little brother.

615
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:32,285
This is creative.

616
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:35,145
He was very talented from a young age,
unlike me.

617
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,959
Your paintings always give me goosebumps.

618
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,999
Your last piece was
"Cross Section of Death",

619
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,355
and now, "The Dark Side of Death".

620
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,595
We all die one day.

621
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:49,135
And that is a very beautiful thing.

622
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,895
You think it's beautiful?

623
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:56,635
Death is the only thing
that's fair and peaceful to everyone.

624
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,749
In other words...

625
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:00,505
Hey, Min-soo!

626
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,715
What? It's them again?

627
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,415
Stop right there.

628
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,255
You should leave.

629
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:13,189
I'm from "Fact Check"!

630
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:14,929
We have a question for you,
Mr. Kim Min-soo!

631
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:16,529
If you don't leave, we'll call the cops.

632
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:18,799
There's no need for that. I'm a cop.

633
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,995
I came just in case you might call.
Now, get lost.

634
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:23,095
Hey.

635
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:26,009
He got suspended, so just kick him out.

636
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:27,039
You punk.

637
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:31,135
That's my privacy.
You can't just tell them that.

638
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:34,579
Listen. I'm not a cop, and I don't work
at the broadcasting station.

639
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:36,679
I'm just a big fan of Mr. Kim Min-soo.

640
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,175
So will you let me through?

641
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:41,485
I guess not.

642
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,985
Mr. Kim, do you remember me?

643
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:46,855
Do you know him?

644
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:50,299
How could you not remember me?

645
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:52,795
- You called me your number one fan.
- My gosh.

646
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:55,999
You can hold your fan meeting in prison.

647
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,909
But before that, you need to sign
a few things in the interrogation room.

648
00:36:58,910 --> 00:36:59,905
Come on.

649
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:02,735
My gosh, you punk.

650
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:05,875
You darn punk.

651
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:09,975
Why won't you listen to me?

652
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,215
What?

653
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:13,519
Where are the others?

654
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,519
"The others"?

655
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,689
They probably won't make it here.

656
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:17,685

657
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:19,689
You startled me!

658
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:21,289
My goodness.

659
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:24,495
Don't come near me! Just don't!

660
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:29,035
You guys! We have a lot of time!

661
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,895
So let's make this a work of art!

662
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:26,955
Put your arms up properly.

663
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:30,399
Let me make this clear.

664
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,965
If you use physical violence
to stop us from investigating,

665
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:34,529
it's considered
an obstruction of business.

666
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:36,035
That's enough.

667
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:38,335
Shouldn't you be filming something?

668
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,335
Do you understand?

669
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:43,435
Mr. Kim Min-soo.

670
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:49,545
Did you upload a video of yourself
killing a cat on the dark web?

671
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,015
You're that lady from last time.

672
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:53,985
I'm Kim Min-seok.

673
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:56,289
Gosh, you punks.

674
00:38:56,290 --> 00:39:00,325
You guys should be wearing name tags.

675
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:04,425
You know Lee Jong-dae, right?

676
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:07,299
The culprit's fingerprints were
on the weapon that was found at the scene.

677
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,039
And the same fingerprints were also found

678
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,395
on the weapon that was left
at the scene of a recent murder.

679
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:14,809
You solved the mystery behind
the unidentified fingerprints?

680
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:15,805
Yes.

681
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:20,575
Here is a possible explanation.

682
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:22,879
What are you doing?

683
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,919
Don't interrupt during the shoot.

684
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,845
It's my turn to talk, so hush.

685
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,155
Twelve years ago,

686
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:35,659
when Mr. Kim Min-soo found out
that he had left the weapon at the scene,

687
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:37,295
it was too late to go back for it.

688
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:41,425
[ But his fingerprints weren't
registered yet since he was only 17. ]

689
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,565
[ So he came up with an idea. ]

690
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,169
[ Something only twins could do. ]

691
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,365
[ Kim Min-soo ]

692
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,579
[ Left four fingers, Right four fingers ]

693
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:57,719
[ Right thumb ]

694
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:00,619
That is how he was able to leave
his weapon behind

695
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:03,715
after he committed the recent murder.

696
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:07,255
Because his fingerprints
aren't registered.

697
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:10,855
Is this all true?

698
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,295
I noticed

699
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:17,039
that you guys registered
the same fingerprints.

700
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,409
If you're not the culprit,
there'd be no reason for you

701
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:23,335
to forge an official document like this.

702

Kim Min-soo.

703
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:30,649
You're under arrest
for the murder of Lee Jong-dae and...

Okay, cut.

You put handcuffs on him.
What more do we need?

707
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:39,729

That's the main part.

- What?

It's best not to respond
to everything he says.

736
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:24,295
He has no evidence,
so he's just trying to provoke you.
