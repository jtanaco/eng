1
00:01:06,229 --> 00:01:07,300
It's so windy.

2
00:01:07,869 --> 00:01:09,599
We should go back inside.

3
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:17,250
Okay.

4
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:27,660
Was I supposed to kiss him?

5
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,300
No, he turned away.

6
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,709
"Start flirting with other guys..."

7
00:01:45,709 --> 00:01:47,410
"so he'll think it was a joke."

(How to seduce a man if you failed already.)

9
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:49,610
No, this one doesn't sound right.

10
00:01:59,349 --> 00:02:01,289
"Act like nothing ever happened."

11
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,589
No, I don't think I can do that.

(Jae Young)

13
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,069
(I'm in a meeting.)

14
00:02:10,069 --> 00:02:12,400
(I'm in a meeting. I'll call you back soon.)

15
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,539
"A meeting"?

16
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:16,940
You can't be back yet, and you're in a meeting?

17
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:21,109
You spent the night with him, and you say you're in a meeting?

18
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,549
(Give it one more try and hit on him properly.)

19
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,650
"Give it one more try and hit on him properly."

20
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:29,819
- What? - What?

21
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:31,349
What? What's the matter?

22
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:34,660
What? What do you mean? What did I do?

23
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:38,030
What... I... I'm sorry.

24
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:40,099
I think I heard something.

25
00:02:40,329 --> 00:02:41,359
I didn't say anything.

26
00:02:41,359 --> 00:02:43,229
Didn't you say you're going to do something properly?

27
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:44,799
No, I really didn't say anything.

28
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:47,970
I'm sorry.

29
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:51,340
Why? Did you do something to upset me?

30
00:02:52,509 --> 00:02:54,340
No... No.

31
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,949
- I'm sorry. - You just apologized again.

32
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,519
Why do you keep apologizing? You're starting to offend me.

33
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,490
- I'm sorry. - Hey!

34
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:04,750
What?

35
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:12,590
I think we should just be quiet.

36
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:15,859
Okay.

37
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:35,180
You can drop me off over there.

38
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,919
I'll...

39
00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:40,259
I'll drive you to your house.

40
00:03:40,259 --> 00:03:42,090
- It's okay. - No, I'll just get off here.

41
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:05,910
Hey.

42
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,419
Do you like guys by any chance?

43
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:11,919
What?

44
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,589
How... Don't I look...

45
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,829
pretty straight?

46
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:21,930
Well, I just thought you might be single...

47
00:04:22,159 --> 00:04:24,769
because of that.

48
00:04:26,269 --> 00:04:29,069
I totally respect people's different sexual orientations.

49
00:04:31,269 --> 00:04:32,440
Well, I don't like guys.

50
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:33,810
Okay.

51
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:37,949
By the way,

52
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:42,449
I hope my apology...

53
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:46,990
doesn't end up keeping you awake at night.

54
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:55,860
Good night.

55
00:04:58,670 --> 00:04:59,769
Good night.

56
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,680
Oh, my gosh!

57
00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:53,120
Are you crazy? What are you doing there?

58
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,759
What took you so long to come home?

59
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,730
Were you with Mr. Han all day?

60
00:05:57,889 --> 00:06:00,829
I'm tired. Save the nagging for tomorrow.

61
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,100
Why did you spend the night? I thought it was a day trip.

62
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,040
I know, right? I can't believe I spent the night.

63
00:06:11,509 --> 00:06:14,339
You're starting to go a little crazy these days.

64
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:18,279
Don't tell me you slept with him yesterday.

65
00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:20,620
Maybe I should've.

66
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:21,880
Are you serious?

67
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:26,719
Hey.

68
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,959
How do you think of me as a woman?

69
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:34,029
What?

70
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:36,399
- Am I unattractive? - No.

71
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,839
You're not unattractive.

72
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:46,639
Right?

73
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:50,350
If you flirt with a guy, and he shows no reaction,

74
00:06:50,909 --> 00:06:52,850
he's probably a priest, a monk,

75
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:55,880
or asexual.

76
00:06:58,719 --> 00:06:59,790
Right.

77
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:04,459
What's the meaning behind that smile?

78
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:06,459
You need to be wise when choosing men.

79
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:09,659
Don't be swooned by what you see on the outside. Okay?

80
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:11,469
Ha Ri.

81
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,639
What in the world happened between them?

82
00:07:32,149 --> 00:07:34,790
I should've kissed her, right?

83
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:47,740
I mean, come on.

84
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:51,370
It wouldn't have been a bad idea to kiss her, right?

85
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,069
No? You think it's wrong?

86
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,540
Forget it.

87
00:08:00,819 --> 00:08:06,649
(Good job!)

88
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:11,190
(Episode 5: Hard to Hide Our Feelings)

89
00:08:19,969 --> 00:08:21,800
My gosh, go away if you don't want to eat.

90
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:24,069
Give it back to me right now.

91
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,569
You can't eat bibimbap without a fried egg.

92
00:08:25,569 --> 00:08:26,980
What makes you think you deserve this?

93
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:28,610
Do you have a death wish?

94
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:31,279
My gosh, here's another one.

95
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:35,019
Seeing him eat just made me lose my appetite.

96
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:39,250
Will you two stop? You're both too old for this.

97
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:41,320
You make a great couple,

98
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,689
so why won't you get together already?

99
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:46,090
- Why would I... - Auntie, I'm eating.

100
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:48,500
- What you said is disgusting. - I might throw up.

101
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:50,029
Shut it, the both of you.

102
00:08:52,929 --> 00:08:54,039
What are you looking at?

103
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:56,000
Gosh, the letters are so tiny.

104
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,039
- Can you send a text for me? - Sure.

105
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,139
"Got it."

106
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:04,950
(Got it.)

107
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:05,950
Did you send it?

108
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:07,720
Is your mountaineering club going somewhere?

109
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:09,880
An overnight trip to the East Sea.

110
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:11,620
- An overnight trip? - Gosh.

111
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:14,460
Are you sure you're going as a group?

112
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,490
Who's the mystery guy?

113
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:17,960
Should I get ready to be shocked?

114
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,429
No, but brace yourself for a smack.

115
00:09:19,689 --> 00:09:21,899
- It hurts. - You should focus...

116
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,360
on your dating life, not mine.

117
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:27,439
Well, I'm looking for a donor...

118
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:29,139
who isn't embarrassed.

119
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,309
You failed to find an ordinary guy to marry,

120
00:09:31,509 --> 00:09:34,110
so I doubt the search will get you anywhere.

121
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,909
Mom, don't forget to buy squid!

122
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,490
Do you know when voters show the most hostility to politicians?

123
00:09:50,789 --> 00:09:52,189
What are you getting at?

124
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,460
It's when they don't live up to their promises.

125
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:57,169
They shouldn't promise a better economy...

126
00:09:57,169 --> 00:09:58,669
and receive bribes to fill their own pockets.

127
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,600
So?

128
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,439
Keep that in mind.

129
00:10:04,769 --> 00:10:07,309
You're searching for a sperm donor, not a husband.

130
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,080
I'm fully supportive of you,

131
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:12,210
so don't go back on your promise, Ha Ri.

132
00:10:14,179 --> 00:10:15,250
Just get back to your meal.

133
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:18,450
Sure. Why not?

134
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:21,689
Eat quietly.

135
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,689
This is the quietest I've ever been while eating.

136
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:28,460
You're so annoying.

137
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,899
So when you called Ha Ri the other day,

138
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:35,070
she said she couldn't come home because of a landslide?

139
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,740
I saw the expenses report she handed in earlier...

140
00:10:38,269 --> 00:10:39,769
and she booked herself a room.

141
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:42,240
- Then they slept together. - Many babies are conceived...

142
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,309
during big events, right?

143
00:10:43,439 --> 00:10:45,980
- Think of the 2002 World Cup. - My gosh!

144
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,279
Hold on. Are you older than I am?

145
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:51,620
I read it in a news article.

146
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,189
Gosh, I can't believe it.

147
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:57,029
- Hold on. - How should we greet her?

148
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,360
Goodness.

149
00:10:59,429 --> 00:11:01,960
A sudden overnight trip is also...

150
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,799
how I got married.

151
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:08,070
Was there something going on between them?

152
00:11:08,169 --> 00:11:11,070
Who cares when Mother Nature gave them a nudge?

153
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,269
Only idiots would've passed up on that chance.

154
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,039
- Hi, Ha Ri. - Hi.

155
00:11:16,179 --> 00:11:17,580
You seem to be in a good mood.

156
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,450
What? That's ridiculous.

157
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,679
But you're glowing today.

158
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:24,250
Don't be silly. So how's the special feature coming along?

159
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,889
You have no idea how busy I've been.

160
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,159
Well, I wish you luck.

161
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:29,620
Bye.

162
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:33,759
Right? Of course she can't help but smile.

163
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,630
The world must be in different shades of pink to her.

164
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:37,830
How about pink bed sheets as a wedding gift?

165
00:11:37,929 --> 00:11:39,269
Wouldn't money be better?

166
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:41,439
Have we already sent her down the aisle?

167
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:44,669
It might be better to throw her a baby shower.

168
00:11:44,669 --> 00:11:46,240
- Gosh! - You're right.

169
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,240
- What's going on? - Why the sudden mood change?

170
00:11:50,549 --> 00:11:51,610
My gosh.

171
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:02,019
Did it not happen?

172
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:05,529
Is it true that she never had luck with blind dates?

173
00:12:05,529 --> 00:12:06,960
She's only good at fending them off.

174
00:12:07,659 --> 00:12:10,299
No way. I bet she was only swept up in sad thoughts.

175
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,799
She hasn't dated for 10 years,

176
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,570
so she no longer knows how to be in the mood.

177
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,240
It's the same with I Sang.

178
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,769
He only had one long-term girlfriend...

179
00:12:17,769 --> 00:12:19,870
which means he has zero dating experience.

180
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,179
He's a sap in that department.

181
00:12:21,309 --> 00:12:22,809
What did we even expect?

182
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:26,149
("The Joy of Living Alone")

183
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:59,409
What? No.

184
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,019
Stop it.

185
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:06,750
This is wrong.

186
00:13:10,259 --> 00:13:11,289
Ms. Jang.

187
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:38,889
Unbelievable.

188
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:41,159
You're even stopping yourself from daydreaming?

189
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:46,159
Now I'm seeing things.

190
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:49,559
Exactly. This is what happens when you're sexually frustrated.

191
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,340
I'm only telling you this because it's all in my head.

192
00:13:55,439 --> 00:13:58,309
This is me doing my utmost best to hold back.

193
00:13:58,539 --> 00:14:01,939
Why are you holding back though? I'm 39, not 19.

194
00:14:02,779 --> 00:14:04,149
There's no need to be a gentleman.

195
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:06,009
We're both adults,

196
00:14:06,009 --> 00:14:07,820
so an R-rated scene won't be a problem.

197
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:11,490
I'm being this way because of our age.

198
00:14:11,689 --> 00:14:12,919
We should meet someone

199
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:14,259
we want to spend the rest of our lives with,

200
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:16,720
not someone we want to enjoy a heated night with.

201
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:19,659
Can't you see that I've been...

202
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,159
making room for you in my heart?

203
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,570
If I finally come around to kiss you,

204
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:27,899
then I'll never let you go.

205
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,309
You're being awfully dramatic for a simple kiss.

206
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:38,179
By the way, where's your bedroom? What a nice house.

207
00:14:38,179 --> 00:14:39,509
My bedroom?

208
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:41,720
Where are you off to?

209
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,019
- Here? - Ms. Jang?

210
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:44,820
What a nice house.

211
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,590
Wait. You can't do this to me.

212
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:50,259
You...

213
00:14:52,889 --> 00:14:54,630
What on earth was that?

214
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:57,700
Am I really sexually frustrated?

215
00:14:58,899 --> 00:14:59,899
What's wrong with me?

216
00:15:04,309 --> 00:15:06,439
- Hyo Joo. - Yes?

217
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:09,179
Weren't you supposed to take photos of the cooking process?

218
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:11,950
The instructions seemed easy, so I thought I'd write them down.

219
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:16,380
Young moms don't know how finely they should chop up the ingredients.

220
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:18,950
The ingredient's size differs depending on the children's age,

221
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:20,019
so how can we not show pictures?

222
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:22,789
The dishes are styled beautifully.

223
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:25,130
Photos of the cooking process will only ruin the aesthetic.

224
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:28,429
Do you think I'm glaring at you to hear your excuses?

225
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,029
I'll have the photos taken.

226
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:34,240
Make sure you have the Advertising Department...

227
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,240
confirm the expiration date on the toothpaste.

228
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,110
They won't bother if you don't remind them.

229
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,639
Shouldn't she be grateful by the fact...

230
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:45,279
that someone as beautiful as me...

231
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,909
- is working here? - What...

232
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,850
Ms. Choi!

233
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,689
Are you off to lunch? I'm just coming back from work outside.

234
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,490
Is something up?

235
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:00,159
You seem upset.

236
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:03,929
Did you get an earful?

237
00:16:04,669 --> 00:16:06,500
What on earth are you talking about?

238
00:16:06,769 --> 00:16:07,870
I guess you didn't.

239
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:10,600
But that's what your expression told me.

240
00:16:11,909 --> 00:16:13,409
Mr. Choi Kang,

241
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,679
could you please mind your own business?

242
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,179
When one doesn't answer you,

243
00:16:17,179 --> 00:16:19,080
it means that he or she doesn't want to talk.

244
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:23,950
Sorry about that. I don't take hints well, do I?

245
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,549
You really don't.

246
00:16:26,549 --> 00:16:28,360
You're awful at taking hints!

247
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:33,230
Let's just stick to polite greetings, okay?

248
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,559
Sure thing. I will from now on.

249
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:39,870
I'll get going then since I'm only making you uncomfortable.

250
00:16:43,299 --> 00:16:44,769
What an idiot.

251
00:16:51,509 --> 00:16:53,809
Are you kidding me?

252
00:16:54,419 --> 00:16:57,419
Gosh, it hurts.

253
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:06,989
Let's just stick to polite greetings, okay?

254
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:14,570
Good luck.

255
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,340
He left without helping?

256
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,979
Get out of there!

257
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:27,880
My gosh.

258
00:17:28,979 --> 00:17:29,979
Unbelievable.

259
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:38,360
As if this would kill my vibe.

260
00:17:38,989 --> 00:17:41,899
Why is it so dark in here?

261
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,030
I mean...

262
00:17:48,169 --> 00:17:50,239
What's going on? Are you sick?

263
00:17:52,169 --> 00:17:54,709
I see her when my eyes are open...

264
00:17:55,709 --> 00:17:57,209
and when they're closed.

265
00:17:58,749 --> 00:18:00,510
This is killing me.

266
00:18:02,149 --> 00:18:04,719
What's wrong? Are you having hallucinations?

267
00:18:04,949 --> 00:18:06,350
What's the problem?

268
00:18:06,749 --> 00:18:07,959
Is it here or here?

269
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:13,260
I can't tell if it's my mind or heart...

270
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:15,100
that's hurting.

271
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,060
All I know is that it hurts.

272
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:21,699
There's a song called "A Disease Called Love".

273
00:18:21,699 --> 00:18:23,270
I especially like Part Two.

274
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,540
Why are you here?

275
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:26,439
I'm swamped with photoshoots today.

276
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:28,810
Ms. Jang has an important one which involves...

277
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:30,409
an infertile couple.

278
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:31,649
Could you...

279
00:18:32,979 --> 00:18:34,350
perhaps take the job?

280
00:18:35,419 --> 00:18:38,590
You've got to be kidding me.

281
00:18:39,689 --> 00:18:42,020
Why? In case it'll hurt more?

282
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,399
Hey.

283
00:18:54,469 --> 00:18:55,499
Get dressed.

284
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,669
Come on.

285
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:01,679
Do this shoot for me.

286
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,249
A picture of the product and one for a review.

287
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,949
Why should I?

288
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:07,949
It's an excuse to go to the studio.

289
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,979
Mr. Han is there.

290
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,189
Mr. Nam went to the hospital and is out.

291
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:14,360
Stop that.

292
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:18,189
Listen. If something happened,

293
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:21,999
you need to go with it and make it something more.

294
00:19:22,229 --> 00:19:24,830
Don't jump to conclusions, and don't give me advice.

295
00:19:24,999 --> 00:19:26,969
Just drink your watermelon juice.

296
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,310
Did you hold hands?

297
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:35,840
- We did not. - You put the moves on though.

298
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:37,239
I did not.

299
00:19:38,249 --> 00:19:39,909
You did send him clear signs, right?

300
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:42,649
Why are you guys so interested in my love life?

301
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:44,249
It's fun.

302
00:19:45,249 --> 00:19:48,719
You're bored, right? You don't have enough work, do you?

303
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,060
I'm sorry.

304
00:19:52,229 --> 00:19:54,130
Go. Get to work.

305
00:20:04,639 --> 00:20:05,639
Stop it.

306
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:10,639
It's a hallucination.

307
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:12,850
Don't fall apart. No.

308
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:13,880
What are you doing?

309
00:20:21,959 --> 00:20:24,159
Seriously. Again?

310
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,159
Are you back?

311
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,899
Okay. Hi.

312
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,570
You're copying me now, too?

313
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,479
What?

314
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,649
What?

315
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:53,489
I actually felt something. Are you a human?

316
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,860
Look. I've been saying hi.

317
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:59,090
Do you feel sick?

318
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:04,399
Okay. Let's go in.

319
00:21:16,639 --> 00:21:17,649
Snap out of it.

320
00:21:31,689 --> 00:21:35,330
"Signals that are 100 percent effective."

321
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:36,959
(Rest your head on his shoulder and tilt it 45 degrees)

322
00:21:36,959 --> 00:21:40,030
"Rest your head on his shoulder and tilt it 45 degrees."

323
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:43,969
"Pucker your lips toward his face."

324
00:21:48,939 --> 00:21:51,010
Mr. Han, can we chat?

325
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:52,850
Okay.

326
00:21:54,979 --> 00:21:58,020
I'm not sure at which angle we should take this.

327
00:21:59,249 --> 00:22:00,919
We should look at it thoroughly.

328
00:22:05,429 --> 00:22:07,060
I think we can just take it.

329
00:22:07,929 --> 00:22:09,999
Right? We can just take it.

330
00:22:16,239 --> 00:22:17,570
I'm sleepy.

331
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:25,010
You're sleepy?

332
00:22:26,149 --> 00:22:27,179
Yes.

333
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:33,189
I'll take the pictures. Take a nap.

334
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:34,760
What?

335
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:42,100
Where did my camera go? Here it is.

336
00:22:53,639 --> 00:22:55,810
Nice, everyone's gone!

337
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:58,380
Awesome.

338
00:22:59,209 --> 00:23:01,010
Goodness.

339
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:04,590
What's this?

340
00:23:04,749 --> 00:23:06,620
I hope your feet will be comfortable in these.

341
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:12,389
This is seriously so nasty.

342
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,800
Where did he even find this?

343
00:23:19,699 --> 00:23:21,300
This is Cucci, not Gucci.

344
00:23:23,469 --> 00:23:24,540
Do you not like it?

345
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:31,449
Can't you tell what my style is?

346
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:37,749
They had Brada too. I should've gotten those.

347
00:23:38,219 --> 00:23:41,860
You really are amazing, Mr. Choi Kang.

348
00:23:43,159 --> 00:23:44,459
You're too kind.

349
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:46,630
Wear these for now.

350
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:49,929
I'll get you Brada and Ballemciaga next time.

351
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:51,199
It's 2 for 10 dollars.

352
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:53,870
It's fine. Don't bother.

353
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,709
I'm happy with these.

354
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:02,510
Do you mean it?

355
00:24:05,149 --> 00:24:08,050
These are very durable.

356
00:24:08,149 --> 00:24:09,350
Stop talking.

357
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,459
That looks super fancy.

358
00:24:19,189 --> 00:24:20,530
I make even these look good.

359
00:24:20,729 --> 00:24:24,729
I guess designer goods make the person look classy.

360
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,699
They look great on you.

361
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:29,070
Wear them for a long, long time. I'll go now.

362
00:24:30,399 --> 00:24:31,439
Have a nice day.

363
00:24:32,439 --> 00:24:33,469
A long, long time.

364
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:37,409
What is he yapping about after buying me knock-offs?

365
00:24:38,149 --> 00:24:41,679
My gosh. How cheap. They're not Gucci, they're Gucheap.

366
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:47,120
These are so nice.

367
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,389
It's like they were made for me.

368
00:24:53,189 --> 00:24:54,860
Are you doing the shoot?

369
00:24:55,159 --> 00:24:57,060
The schedule was posted. Did you miss it because you were sleeping?

370
00:24:57,459 --> 00:24:58,530
I did not.

371

372
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:03,639
so it'll be good for your career as well.

373
00:25:04,739 --> 00:25:07,770
You sound so sweet. Is it because you slept so well?

374
00:25:08,179 --> 00:25:10,540
I did not sleep well.

375
00:25:10,939 --> 00:25:13,880
I worked hard on this series. I wish you'd keep working on it.

376

378
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:23,989
Okay.

379

- Hello. - Hello.

382
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:35,600
How do you feel?

383
00:25:36,399 --> 00:25:38,239
I thought I'd be okay since it's our second,

384
00:25:39,209 --> 00:25:40,510
but I'm twice as nervous.

385
00:25:40,709 --> 00:25:42,139
I can totally understand.

386
00:25:42,909 --> 00:25:44,709
- Come in. - Okay.

387
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:46,080
Okay.

388
00:25:46,449 --> 00:25:49,479
We'll film the consultation...

389
00:25:49,479 --> 00:25:52,449
as well as the steps afterward.

391
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,260
Hello.

392
00:26:03,429 --> 00:26:04,499
Okay.

393
00:26:04,669 --> 00:26:07,939
You've done it before, so you know you need to relax, right?

394
00:26:08,169 --> 00:26:09,199
Yes.

395
00:26:09,639 --> 00:26:11,969
Many people get fertility treatments,

396
00:26:12,239 --> 00:26:14,580
so don't think it's only you.

397
00:26:14,909 --> 00:26:17,409
Think of it as a special way to meet your child.

398
00:26:18,149 --> 00:26:19,149
Okay.

399
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:20,880
Do you have any questions?

400
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,479
Are there any medications she should avoid?

401
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:25,820
Vitamins are fine.

402
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:29,320
You have to consult me first before taking anything else.

403
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,620
Are you taking anything now?

404
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:33,659
I'm only taking lactobacillus at the moment.

405
00:26:34,189 --> 00:26:35,199
That's fine.

406
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:04,630
Give her a lot of help.

407
00:27:04,959 --> 00:27:06,030
I will.

408
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:08,630
Please tell me if there's anything I should do for her.

409
00:27:08,929 --> 00:27:10,060
Just be supportive.

410
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:20,070
I really hope it works this time.

411
00:27:21,169 --> 00:27:24,439
Must they work so hard and force it?

412
00:27:26,709 --> 00:27:28,449
You have to sacrifice so much...

413
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:32,290
for a being that doesn't exist.

414
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,600
Look over there.

415
00:27:48,169 --> 00:27:50,600
How could they make a face like that?

416
00:27:53,909 --> 00:27:56,280
When you look at a mom looking at her baby,

417
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,510
isn't it amazing?

418
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,580
Just how must a person love another person...

419
00:28:03,419 --> 00:28:05,090
to make a face like that?

420
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:08,620
How can a person...

421
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,530
give another person unconditional love...

422
00:28:13,929 --> 00:28:16,630
without wanting anything in return?

423
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,540
I feel like having someone to love like that in itself...

424
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:28,679
would set me free from being lonely.

425
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:33,780
Is that why women always choose the baby...

426
00:28:34,649 --> 00:28:36,620
if they had to choose...

427
00:28:37,179 --> 00:28:40,620
between the person they love or their baby?

428
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:47,630
I won't let go...

429
00:28:49,929 --> 00:28:50,959
of the person I love.

430
00:28:52,899 --> 00:28:55,040
I know that having a baby is a miracle.

431
00:28:57,169 --> 00:29:00,409
But I haven't fallen in love for the past 10 years,

432
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:04,080
so love is also a miracle to me.

433
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:15,419
I brought you some popular baby stuff...

434
00:29:15,419 --> 00:29:17,659
for you and Do Ah.

435
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:21,729
Babies have sensitive skin, so it's important to wash them...

436
00:29:21,729 --> 00:29:23,100
with filtered and clean water.

437
00:29:23,659 --> 00:29:25,270
You're also starting a new life,

438
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:27,070
so wash yourself properly and become a new person.

439
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,469
Use it well.

440
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:31,969
And you just need to take a photo to prove that you're using it well.

441
00:29:32,209 --> 00:29:35,340
No, I don't feel any sincerity in what you're saying right now.

442
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:39,749
You'll realize that I'm sincere once you see all the baby stuff...

443
00:29:39,749 --> 00:29:41,449
that I'll be bringing from now on.

444
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,550
Really? Then let me see that.

445
00:30:01,693 --> 00:30:02,693
What are you doing?

446
00:30:07,904 --> 00:30:10,334
Why aren't you giving it to me? All I did was grab it.

447
00:30:10,334 --> 00:30:11,743
Look how hard you're holding onto it.

448
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:13,644
Fine. Let's just stay like this all night.

449
00:30:13,644 --> 00:30:14,943
I just changed the showerhead.

450
00:30:16,243 --> 00:30:17,374
And I did it in one go.

451
00:30:18,414 --> 00:30:19,414
I see.

452
00:30:19,884 --> 00:30:22,953
You're turning 40 soon, but you're still so tiny.

453
00:30:22,953 --> 00:30:25,584
I can hug you with just one arm. What's the matter with you?

454
00:30:25,584 --> 00:30:27,483
You should exercise your shoulders and increase your strength.

455
00:30:27,483 --> 00:30:29,624
What do you want? Do you want me to beat you up?

456
00:30:29,854 --> 00:30:31,763
How about I beat you up tonight?

457
00:30:32,094 --> 00:30:34,023

It's warm, isn't it?

459

My sweetheart.

460
00:30:40,834 --> 00:30:42,834
What are you doing? What's with your face?

461
00:30:43,334 --> 00:30:46,144
I'm trying to look natural as I wash my kid.

462
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:48,243
Just be yourself. Don't look at the camera.

I never washed her with her mom, so this is new to me.

00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:57,683
I'm just saying.

466
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,423
I was just talking about the situation.

I may not be her mom,

470
00:31:14,203 --> 00:31:16,273
but I take care of her like an aunt.

471
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:18,604
Actually, that's what I am. I'm her aunt.

472

You're not her aunt. You're just a stranger.

We're not strangers.

Then what are we?

We're not a family. We're not married.

477

We're pretty much a family.

00:32:48,493 --> 00:32:50,164
Hello, ma'am.

500
00:32:51,864 --> 00:32:54,933
Did I not pack Do Yeon's blanket?

501
00:32:55,973 --> 00:32:58,943
I'm sorry. Right now, I'm with her sister at the hospital.

502
00:33:01,003 --> 00:33:03,644
What should I do? There's no one I can send to fetch her blanket.

503
00:33:06,213 --> 00:33:08,383
Yes, can you just cover her with that?

504
00:33:09,254 --> 00:33:12,323
Okay, thank you. Bye.

505
00:33:14,354 --> 00:33:15,653
Jae Yi.

506
00:33:17,694 --> 00:33:19,093
It's okay.

507
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:22,664
I can do this alone.

508
00:33:23,433 --> 00:33:24,763
We're at the hospital.

509
00:33:25,604 --> 00:33:26,664
You're okay now.

510
00:33:43,214 --> 00:33:44,283
Ms. Shim.

511
00:33:49,093 --> 00:33:51,493
Did Ms. Shim go home?

512
00:33:51,964 --> 00:33:53,064
She took the day off.

513
00:33:56,433 --> 00:33:58,164
Why do you keep coming to the office?

514
00:33:58,263 --> 00:33:59,633
Do you think your suspension is a joke?

515
00:33:59,903 --> 00:34:00,933
No, sir.

516
00:34:04,073 --> 00:34:07,473
Tell Ms. Shim to send me the content management report.

517
00:34:16,714 --> 00:34:19,953
You heard him, right? I need to disappear now.

518
00:34:20,053 --> 00:34:21,624
So hurry up and finish the manuscript.

519
00:34:21,624 --> 00:34:23,254
- Okay. - I'm off to the studio.

520
00:34:33,064 --> 00:34:34,064
Hello?

521
00:35:03,294 --> 00:35:04,734
Ha Ri is late.

522
00:35:09,004 --> 00:35:11,234
Who keeps sending me text messages?

523
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:16,613
What?

524
00:35:17,743 --> 00:35:19,243
(Hey, isn't this your friend?)

525
00:35:19,243 --> 00:35:21,644
Stay still. My goodness.

526
00:35:22,314 --> 00:35:23,754
Okay, good job.

527
00:35:24,383 --> 00:35:25,783
His lungs sound fine.

528
00:35:25,783 --> 00:35:27,624
I'll prescribe three days' worth of medicine for his cold,

529
00:35:27,624 --> 00:35:28,924
so come back after he takes them.

530
00:35:28,924 --> 00:35:31,354
- Okay. - You're all done.

531
00:35:31,993 --> 00:35:34,464
- I'm going to jump on the bed. - Can you check him too?

532
00:35:34,564 --> 00:35:35,694
He's also going to catch a cold soon.

533
00:35:36,133 --> 00:35:38,064
He needs to show symptoms.

534
00:35:38,464 --> 00:35:40,564
- Go on. - I want to go!

535
00:35:40,564 --> 00:35:42,674
Hey! Don't cause trouble.

536
00:35:43,504 --> 00:35:46,343
Then prescribe medicine for both of them with no charge.

537
00:35:47,903 --> 00:35:49,013
Do you think this is a supermarket?

538
00:35:49,013 --> 00:35:50,374
You talk as if I'm holding a buy 1 and get 1 free event.

539
00:35:50,374 --> 00:35:52,714
I need two for everything.

540
00:35:52,814 --> 00:35:54,243
Can't you do this for a friend?

541
00:35:54,343 --> 00:35:55,914
You told me you didn't want to be my friend.

542
00:35:55,914 --> 00:35:57,814
Think about what you did.

543
00:35:58,053 --> 00:36:00,823
You cut all ties with us after you got married.

544
00:36:00,984 --> 00:36:03,093
It's not easy to bring my kids to a hospital.

545
00:36:03,323 --> 00:36:05,194
Just do me a favor.

546
00:36:06,294 --> 00:36:09,694
What's your number? Let me introduce you to a psychiatrist.

547
00:36:09,763 --> 00:36:10,863
You're showing severe symptoms.

548
00:36:10,863 --> 00:36:12,164
What's your phone number?

549
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:15,234
I'll report you for refusing to treat your patient.

550
00:36:16,834 --> 00:36:19,774
(The Shocking Sperm Lady)

551
00:36:19,774 --> 00:36:20,843
What's this?

552
00:36:22,243 --> 00:36:23,243
Isn't this Ha Ri?

553
00:36:23,644 --> 00:36:25,814
What? "Ha Ri"?

554
00:36:27,584 --> 00:36:29,484
(The Shocking Sperm Lady)

555
00:36:31,153 --> 00:36:32,153
This is Ha Ri.

556
00:36:37,993 --> 00:36:39,894
Hello, this is the Editing Department for The Baby.

557
00:36:40,624 --> 00:36:43,394
It's her personal life, so we don't know.

558
00:36:44,294 --> 00:36:46,363
It has nothing to do with our magazine,

559
00:36:46,363 --> 00:36:47,533
so you don't need to worry.

560
00:36:47,734 --> 00:36:51,504
No, I don't know anything about it.

561
00:36:51,734 --> 00:36:53,343
Hello, this is the Editing Department for The Baby.

562
00:36:53,343 --> 00:36:55,874
What? What lady? No, she's not here.

563
00:36:57,414 --> 00:37:00,814
Yes, hello. No, I don't know who told you that.

564
00:37:01,183 --> 00:37:03,283
But it's not true. Don't worry.

565
00:37:03,584 --> 00:37:06,424
Hello, this is the Editing Department for The Baby.

566
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:08,794
I'm sorry. I have nothing to tell you. Sorry.

567
00:37:09,694 --> 00:37:11,794
Gosh, I can't believe this!

568
00:37:13,524 --> 00:37:14,964
Hasn't anyone heard from Ha Ri?

569
00:37:17,493 --> 00:37:18,593
Hello, this is the Editing Department for The Baby.

570
00:37:18,593 --> 00:37:19,664
- The receiver cannot be reached... - My goodness.

571
00:37:19,964 --> 00:37:21,564
She won't pick up.

572
00:37:21,564 --> 00:37:23,504
I have to tell her to not answer any phone calls from journalists.

573
00:37:23,504 --> 00:37:26,504
Where in the world is she? People are saying crazy things.

574
00:37:26,973 --> 00:37:28,573
I can't believe her personal information got leaked.

575
00:37:29,243 --> 00:37:30,343
My goodness.

576
00:37:30,973 --> 00:37:32,283
My gosh, I can't believe this.

577
00:37:34,243 --> 00:37:35,314
Hey, where...

578
00:37:53,334 --> 00:37:55,874
Ha Ri, what's going on?

579
00:37:56,033 --> 00:37:59,374
I turned in the posts online as evidence...

580
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:01,544
and asked for them to be removed.

581
00:38:01,544 --> 00:38:04,513
Good thinking. I contacted some people too...

582
00:38:04,513 --> 00:38:07,484
and asked them to delete your personal information...

583
00:38:07,484 --> 00:38:09,113
and hate comments that were posted online.

584
00:38:13,153 --> 00:38:15,794
But Ha Ri... Ha Ri?

585
00:38:17,723 --> 00:38:18,794
Ha Ri?

586
00:38:19,694 --> 00:38:22,133
Are you all right though? Are you okay?

587
00:38:22,363 --> 00:38:25,403
Sorry about that. What did you say you did?

588
00:38:26,803 --> 00:38:28,363
Don't be intimidated, okay?

589
00:38:28,363 --> 00:38:30,473
I warned those who wrote hate comments.

590
00:38:30,674 --> 00:38:34,044
If they keep this up, I'll cut off their fingers myself.

591
00:38:34,044 --> 00:38:35,513
How dare they speak ill of you.

592
00:38:36,214 --> 00:38:38,914
Don't be like that to strangers.

593
00:38:38,914 --> 00:38:41,183
Ha Ri, don't worry too much.

594
00:38:41,814 --> 00:38:42,814
Right.

595
00:38:43,953 --> 00:38:45,553
Thanks for everything. I'll call you back. Sorry.

596
00:39:56,194 --> 00:39:57,854
- Ms. Jang... - What the...

597
00:40:04,564 --> 00:40:06,604
Mr. Choi Kang? What...

598
00:40:07,433 --> 00:40:09,633
What's going on?

599
00:40:10,473 --> 00:40:13,243
(Noodles)

600
00:40:16,644 --> 00:40:18,113
Everyone was worried...

601
00:40:18,113 --> 00:40:19,984
because they couldn't get in touch with Ms. Jang.

602
00:40:20,214 --> 00:40:22,214
I asked HR for her address...

603
00:40:22,683 --> 00:40:24,814
and was headed there to see her.

604
00:40:25,453 --> 00:40:28,283
I was just walking by. I live around here, you see.

605
00:40:29,323 --> 00:40:31,323
This is your fault for not answering your phone.

606
00:40:32,323 --> 00:40:35,863
It was ringing like crazy, so I needed a break.

607
00:40:37,794 --> 00:40:39,263
Did you file a report with the police?

608
00:40:39,834 --> 00:40:41,334
Yes, but it's not just...

609
00:40:41,334 --> 00:40:42,933
my personal information that's the issue.

610
00:40:43,533 --> 00:40:45,743
They know where I work now too.

611
00:40:46,174 --> 00:40:48,973
Don't read any of the online comments, okay?

612
00:40:49,444 --> 00:40:51,243
I don't why they're saying these awful things.

613
00:40:51,243 --> 00:40:52,613
That's not who you are.

614
00:40:52,984 --> 00:40:55,653
Sperm Lady, also known as, gold-digger, right?

615
00:40:57,414 --> 00:40:59,424
They're also saying things about my name too.

616
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:02,593
For the first time in my 39 years, I learned that my name...

617
00:41:02,593 --> 00:41:04,394
has sexual innuendo.

618
00:41:04,524 --> 00:41:08,024
Don't read your emails or messages you receive on social media.

619
00:41:08,194 --> 00:41:10,164
Also, take time off work and get some rest.

620
00:41:10,334 --> 00:41:12,363
You should. That sounds like a plan.

621
00:41:12,533 --> 00:41:15,633
It'll blow over when a new scandal breaks out.

622
00:41:16,303 --> 00:41:18,533
People only see what I did wrong.

623
00:41:19,274 --> 00:41:22,674
But all I wanted was to become a mom.

624
00:41:28,613 --> 00:41:29,683
Ms. Jang.

625
00:41:31,754 --> 00:41:33,823
Let me know if you need any help.

626
00:41:34,924 --> 00:41:36,794
- Sure. - What kind of help...

627
00:41:36,924 --> 00:41:39,564
can a colleague give her?

628
00:41:40,464 --> 00:41:41,924
You should let your roommate know.

629
00:41:42,263 --> 00:41:44,633
The roommate should stick to issues around the house...

630
00:41:45,033 --> 00:41:46,433
and leave work-related problems to her colleagues.

631
00:41:46,433 --> 00:41:49,174
That's me then. I'm your colleague, right?

632
00:41:49,174 --> 00:41:52,133
So you're drawing the line...

633
00:41:52,133 --> 00:41:55,644
and saying that you're only colleagues. Right?

634
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:58,984
Actually, we've always been colleagues.

635
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:01,013
It seems like you need to clear the air...

636
00:42:01,113 --> 00:42:03,084
in regard to who you are to her as well.

637
00:42:03,153 --> 00:42:06,084
I'm the person who lives with her.

638
00:42:06,084 --> 00:42:09,194
I told you that numerous times, so what else should I say?

639
00:42:09,924 --> 00:42:11,223
- Unbelievable. - Gosh.

640
00:42:18,363 --> 00:42:19,964
It's been a while since we got together so...

641
00:42:27,874 --> 00:42:29,743
- How much is it? - 53 dollars.

642
00:42:29,743 --> 00:42:31,113
No, don't.

643
00:42:31,113 --> 00:42:33,243
- I'll buy. - Save it.

644
00:42:33,243 --> 00:42:35,044
- But I said I'd buy. - It's okay.

645
00:42:35,044 --> 00:42:37,584
- It's all right. - Let us pick up the bill...

646
00:42:37,584 --> 00:42:38,613
and wait for us outside.

647
00:42:40,053 --> 00:42:41,653
- Here. - Here.

648
00:42:48,794 --> 00:42:51,664
I don't know if it's cute or childish.

649
00:42:53,433 --> 00:42:55,203
It's okay. Let me pay for today.

650
00:42:55,203 --> 00:42:56,703
- Let me. - No, let me.

651
00:42:56,703 --> 00:42:58,533
- Take it back. - Here you go.

652
00:42:58,533 --> 00:43:00,703
You're starting to upset me. Let me pay for this.

653
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:01,973
Why would you though?

654
00:43:01,973 --> 00:43:04,343
Is there a reason why I can't? Here's my card.

655
00:43:04,343 --> 00:43:05,984
I don't let those younger treat me to meals.

656
00:43:06,084 --> 00:43:07,113
What?

657
00:43:07,513 --> 00:43:09,683
I'm probably richer than you are.

658
00:43:11,854 --> 00:43:14,524
Wait. Well,

659
00:43:14,723 --> 00:43:16,493
I didn't want to say this,

660
00:43:16,823 --> 00:43:20,394
but the unit I live in looks over the Han River.

661
00:43:20,394 --> 00:43:21,394
What?

662
00:43:23,863 --> 00:43:25,164
Well, I'm a doctor...

663
00:43:25,493 --> 00:43:28,834
which means I have the potential to end up richer than you.

664
00:43:30,533 --> 00:43:32,004
- Then. - Let me buy instead.

665
00:43:32,004 --> 00:43:33,803
It's only 53 dollars. Here.

666
00:43:34,473 --> 00:43:36,073
You're right, it's her.

667
00:43:36,073 --> 00:43:37,414
See?

668
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:41,584
- Right? - You're right.

669
00:43:41,584 --> 00:43:44,013
- Then... - Hush!

670
00:43:45,183 --> 00:43:46,183
Sperm Lady!

671
00:43:48,383 --> 00:43:50,553
Don't be like that.

672
00:43:51,453 --> 00:43:53,294
You're the Sperm Lady, right?

673
00:43:53,593 --> 00:43:55,294
Stop it.

674
00:43:55,694 --> 00:43:57,533
What did I tell you?

675
00:43:57,794 --> 00:43:59,703
I told you that it was her.

676
00:44:01,203 --> 00:44:02,473
Gosh.

677
00:44:03,473 --> 00:44:05,774
You're way prettier in person though.

678
00:44:06,073 --> 00:44:07,174
You have the wrong person.

679
00:44:07,504 --> 00:44:09,004
Hold on a second.

680
00:44:09,573 --> 00:44:11,674
You need a guy, right?

681
00:44:14,214 --> 00:44:17,013
Let go of me if you want to go home to your wife in one piece.

682
00:44:18,314 --> 00:44:21,283
Look at her playing hard to get. How adorable!

683
00:44:21,283 --> 00:44:24,993
Just so you know, my sperms conceived triplets.

684
00:44:24,993 --> 00:44:27,564
So put your faith in me...

685
00:44:27,564 --> 00:44:28,694
and join me for a glass of wine.

686
00:44:28,694 --> 00:44:30,334
Get your filthy hands off me!

687
00:44:31,093 --> 00:44:33,734
Harassing someone isn't something to be proud of.

688
00:44:33,863 --> 00:44:36,174
Humiliating a person is an act of violence too.

689
00:44:36,504 --> 00:44:37,633
How dare you.

690
00:44:38,734 --> 00:44:40,403
Who do you think you are?

691
00:44:41,374 --> 00:44:44,314
Why are you making me feel ashamed of my good intentions?

692
00:44:45,984 --> 00:44:47,644
- Why? - Thanks for the meal.

693
00:44:51,754 --> 00:44:52,823
Ha Ri?

694
00:44:54,254 --> 00:44:55,323
I don't need the receipt.

695
00:44:56,194 --> 00:44:57,223
Ha Ri?

696
00:44:58,493 --> 00:44:59,664
What's wrong?

697
00:45:01,294 --> 00:45:02,894
Who do you think you are?

698
00:45:05,834 --> 00:45:07,033
What's the meaning of this?

699
00:45:08,803 --> 00:45:10,504
Who are you people?

700
00:45:11,473 --> 00:45:13,403
Why on earth is she in tears?

701
00:45:13,674 --> 00:45:16,374
Must we even ask? She's in tears for crying out loud.

702
00:45:16,414 --> 00:45:19,243
- What did you do to her? - Look here, guys.

703
00:45:19,414 --> 00:45:22,214
Anyone can tell that I'm the victim here.

704
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:24,683
She hit me with her purse.

705
00:45:25,613 --> 00:45:28,524
- Let's call the cops. - Yes, let's call the cops.

706
00:45:28,524 --> 00:45:31,823
Call the cops! That crazy cow will be buried deep...

707
00:45:32,124 --> 00:45:34,794
- once I'm through with her. - Hey!

708
00:45:35,834 --> 00:45:38,564
Fine. Call the cops. I'll make sure you're buried too.

709
00:45:39,803 --> 00:45:41,834
- Should we call the cops? - Hold on a second.

710
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:44,174
What did you call her?

711
00:45:45,133 --> 00:45:46,243
"A crazy cow"?

712
00:45:47,604 --> 00:45:48,644
Say it again.

713
00:45:49,674 --> 00:45:50,743
I dare you to say it again.

714
00:45:57,314 --> 00:45:58,754
Unbelievable!

715
00:45:59,113 --> 00:46:01,153
Guys, just think about this for a second.

716
00:46:01,153 --> 00:46:02,924
We saw her photo online.

717
00:46:02,924 --> 00:46:05,323
It's all over the Internet!

718
00:46:05,323 --> 00:46:07,593
It's just there for everyone to see.

719
00:46:07,593 --> 00:46:09,863
We saw her photo online...

720
00:46:09,863 --> 00:46:12,763
and just acknowledged that we recognized her.

721
00:46:12,763 --> 00:46:14,863
But she got all crazy.

722
00:46:15,303 --> 00:46:17,133
She kicked me...

723
00:46:17,133 --> 00:46:18,903
and hit me with her purse.

724
00:46:19,004 --> 00:46:21,174
That crazy Sperm Lady...

725
00:46:21,174 --> 00:46:22,274
Please don't.

726
00:46:26,484 --> 00:46:27,683
Let's just go.

727
00:46:35,584 --> 00:46:37,553
Mr. Han, don't.

728
00:46:38,194 --> 00:46:39,664
He's not worth it.

729
00:46:57,243 --> 00:47:00,383
Don't be upset over what those mindless jerks said.

730
00:47:01,113 --> 00:47:02,314
You did nothing wrong.

731
00:47:03,653 --> 00:47:04,653
He's right.

732
00:47:04,953 --> 00:47:07,553
You did nothing wrong.

733
00:47:24,933 --> 00:47:27,444
You didn't have to walk me all the way home.

734
00:47:28,444 --> 00:47:31,274
We felt bad, so we wanted to.

735
00:47:31,613 --> 00:47:32,613
That's right.

736
00:47:33,743 --> 00:47:37,714
Besides, I was able to flex my muscles thanks to you.

737
00:47:37,914 --> 00:47:39,823
What a waste.

738
00:47:40,624 --> 00:47:43,424
I wanted to show off my intellect.

739
00:47:44,053 --> 00:47:45,453
I lost my chance.

740
00:47:47,564 --> 00:47:48,593
Ms. Jang.

741
00:47:49,794 --> 00:47:50,863
Look at this.

742
00:47:51,794 --> 00:47:54,433
That guy from earlier. Should we report him?

743
00:47:57,274 --> 00:47:58,274
Show them.

744
00:48:00,203 --> 00:48:01,473
Were you an art major?

745
00:48:02,073 --> 00:48:03,914
- You're good. - You really are.

746
00:48:03,914 --> 00:48:07,644
If you make me laugh like this, I'll shake it off and sleep well.

747
00:48:08,743 --> 00:48:11,254
Thank you. I mean it.

748
00:48:12,854 --> 00:48:13,984
Get home safely.

749
00:48:15,424 --> 00:48:17,553
- Good night. - Thank you both.

750
00:48:17,553 --> 00:48:19,294
- I mean it. - Good night.

751
00:48:22,223 --> 00:48:23,493
- What? - Keep walking.

752
00:48:23,694 --> 00:48:26,303
- Why are you following me? - The front door will wake Do Ah.

753
00:48:26,533 --> 00:48:29,104
- Open it carefully then. - I'll go through your place.

754
00:48:29,234 --> 00:48:30,403
Seriously?

755
00:48:32,033 --> 00:48:33,044
Get out of my way.

756
00:48:37,714 --> 00:48:38,874
They really do live together.

757
00:48:40,243 --> 00:48:41,314
Are they together?

758
00:48:41,414 --> 00:48:43,984
I'm sure they're just friends.

759
00:48:47,683 --> 00:48:50,993
Ms. Jang looked so frail today.

760
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:55,064
I'll have to protect her more going forward.

761
00:48:59,133 --> 00:49:00,164
Shall we go?

762
00:49:16,754 --> 00:49:17,783
Open up.

763
00:49:19,214 --> 00:49:20,854
It's urgent.

764
00:49:21,723 --> 00:49:23,323
Ha Ri! Hurry!

765
00:49:28,964 --> 00:49:30,093
Ta-da.

766
00:49:34,403 --> 00:49:38,073
When I'm sad, I read comic books.

767
00:49:38,674 --> 00:49:39,903
Yes?

768
00:49:48,113 --> 00:49:50,984
Should I post something saying you're not like that?

769
00:49:51,084 --> 00:49:52,183
It's okay.

770
00:49:53,383 --> 00:49:55,084
That won't make anyone understand me.

771
00:50:00,024 --> 00:50:01,593
I'm financially stable,

772
00:50:02,464 --> 00:50:04,664
and I know I can raise a baby well.

773
00:50:05,234 --> 00:50:08,703
But there's no way to have a baby unless I get married.

774
00:50:09,874 --> 00:50:12,874
But I don't have a man or the confidence...

775
00:50:13,303 --> 00:50:14,604
to get married.

776
00:50:17,544 --> 00:50:20,044
How many people would understand if I say that's why I did it?

777
00:50:21,013 --> 00:50:22,444
It would be hard even 40 years from now.

778
00:50:26,424 --> 00:50:27,953
Don't blame yourself.

779
00:50:28,883 --> 00:50:31,794
Whatever the reason was, no one has the right...

780
00:50:31,794 --> 00:50:33,363
to share your identity or judge you.

781
00:50:34,164 --> 00:50:35,394
No one.

782
00:50:43,104 --> 00:50:46,104
This let me see who's really on my side.

783
00:50:46,843 --> 00:50:47,874
So it's fine.

784
00:50:50,243 --> 00:50:51,343
Me?

785
00:50:54,013 --> 00:50:55,113
That's right.

786
00:50:59,553 --> 00:51:01,424
Oh no.

787
00:51:01,624 --> 00:51:04,453
Oh no. Do Ah.

788
00:51:06,723 --> 00:51:08,823
Were you scared because you were alone?

789
00:51:08,924 --> 00:51:10,993
Is that right, Do Ah?

790
00:51:10,993 --> 00:51:13,303
Don't cry. It's okay.

791
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:14,863
It's okay.

792
00:51:14,863 --> 00:51:18,633
Goodness. You were scared because you were all alone.

793
00:51:18,633 --> 00:51:21,174
- Goodness. - Ha Ri.

794
00:51:24,374 --> 00:51:25,374
Do you want to marry me?

795
00:51:28,802 --> 00:51:29,902
Ha Ri.

796
00:51:32,572 --> 00:51:33,572
Do you want to marry me?

797
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:42,080
Listen. If you want a babysitter, pay for one.

798
00:51:43,051 --> 00:51:44,721
It's hard to get sperm.

799
00:51:46,150 --> 00:51:48,750
Why don't you just raise Do Ah as your own?

800
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:52,190
Don't look at me like that.

801
00:51:53,161 --> 00:51:55,830
There's an easy path before you. Why take a detour?

802
00:51:55,830 --> 00:51:57,360
It's easy for you.

803
00:51:57,730 --> 00:51:58,830
I don't need a man.

804
00:52:01,031 --> 00:52:02,130
Am I a man?

805
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,440
Then what? Are you a woman?

806
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:13,411
A Miss? Ms. Jae Young?

807
00:52:20,821 --> 00:52:23,161
We'll stop for a picture.

808
00:52:23,161 --> 00:52:26,121
- Okay. - Come quickly.

809
00:52:26,121 --> 00:52:27,830
- Look here. - Come this way.

810
00:52:27,830 --> 00:52:29,330
- Okay. - It's so nice.

811
00:52:29,531 --> 00:52:30,860
This is the spot.

812
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:32,601
- It's nice out. - Okay.

813
00:52:32,701 --> 00:52:34,130
- Ready? - Yes!

814
00:52:34,301 --> 00:52:35,801
1, 2, 3.

815
00:52:35,801 --> 00:52:38,000
- Cheese. - One more time.

816
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,400
1, 2, 3.

817
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:40,810
Cheese!

818
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:42,641
Okay. Good.

819
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:44,141
It's so nice out.

820
00:52:44,810 --> 00:52:45,911
- Hey. - Yes?

821
00:52:45,911 --> 00:52:48,851
Your daughter's name is Jang Ha Ri, right? And she works for a magazine.

822
00:52:49,511 --> 00:52:50,650
Why do you ask?

823
00:52:50,650 --> 00:52:52,781
My daughter tells me...

824
00:52:53,091 --> 00:52:55,250
your daughter is all over the Internet.

825
00:52:55,650 --> 00:52:59,121
If you type in her name, her articles will show up.

826
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:01,531
That's true for all reporters. She isn't famous.

827
00:53:01,531 --> 00:53:04,630
No. I hear your daughter is famous.

828
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,060
What was it?

829
00:53:07,170 --> 00:53:08,471
"Sperm Lady"?

830
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:11,940
She should find a man, not buy sperm.

831
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:13,911
Is something wrong with her?

832
00:53:14,971 --> 00:53:16,710
What did I tell you?

833
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:19,341
I told you to make her quit when she said...

834
00:53:19,341 --> 00:53:20,750
she was too busy as a journalist to date.

835
00:53:21,051 --> 00:53:23,451
She couldn't get married yet at her age.

836
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:26,591
She may not have a record, but she's a criminal.

837
00:53:26,851 --> 00:53:29,150
Gosh. That poor thing.

838
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:30,920
She'll never get married.

839
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:33,330
Are you out of your mind? Whom are you calling a criminal?

840
00:53:33,531 --> 00:53:35,661
Who are you to call my daughter a criminal?

841
00:53:35,661 --> 00:53:37,060
What's wrong with you?

842
00:53:37,161 --> 00:53:39,770
- Hey! - Separate them!

843
00:53:39,770 --> 00:53:42,031
- Separate them! Goodness! - What's going on?

844
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:00,020
I'm losing my mind.

845
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:09,531
Hey.

846
00:54:11,830 --> 00:54:14,400
What? You can't go in?

847
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:19,571
Mr. Joo called me in at this hour.

848
00:54:20,011 --> 00:54:22,270
It can't be out of consideration so people don't see me.

849
00:54:23,110 --> 00:54:24,940
It means it's very serious.

850
00:54:26,210 --> 00:54:27,380
I'm a bit scared.

851
00:54:30,181 --> 00:54:32,181
I can't go in for you.

852
00:54:32,551 --> 00:54:34,290
But I'll show you this.

853
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:39,290
Want to see? Ta-da.

854
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:43,730
How's that for the main photo?

855
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:47,431
You're so dependable.

856
00:54:49,201 --> 00:54:52,101
I may be scolded today, but I'll be praised later on.

857
00:54:53,971 --> 00:54:55,770
I wanted to develop the photos with you.

858
00:54:57,781 --> 00:54:58,880
Next time.

859
00:55:03,121 --> 00:55:05,650
Next time, let's go together for sure.

860
00:55:06,321 --> 00:55:07,351
Okay.

861
00:55:10,721 --> 00:55:11,790
Next time.

862
00:55:30,141 --> 00:55:31,181
Sperm Lady.

863
00:55:32,281 --> 00:55:34,310
The chairman wants an apology.

864
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:39,821
The chairman is very concerned because of the complaints...

865
00:55:39,821 --> 00:55:40,920
from readers.

866
00:55:41,790 --> 00:55:43,221
Publish an apology...

867
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:45,560
in lieu of the editor's column.

868
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:46,991
What...

869
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:50,601
She's the victim. Why should she apologize?

870
00:55:50,931 --> 00:55:52,661
This got out of hand.

871
00:55:53,201 --> 00:55:55,871
She should explain and apologize...

872
00:55:55,871 --> 00:55:57,641
to the readers.

873
00:55:57,641 --> 00:55:59,601
This is her personal matter.

874
00:55:59,911 --> 00:56:02,511
I'm against it becoming public as a magazine matter.

875
00:56:02,511 --> 00:56:05,810
I won't waste a precious page for a flimsy apology.

876
00:56:05,810 --> 00:56:07,551
It's not a flimsy apology!

877
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:11,351
She should apologize sincerely and calm the readers down.

878
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:13,551
Why are you so dense?

879
00:56:15,891 --> 00:56:19,960
So... I... I know...

880
00:56:20,531 --> 00:56:21,661
I was wrong.

881
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:27,801
I know I disappointed the readers.

882
00:56:28,770 --> 00:56:31,900
I'm very sorry for hurting the magazine's credibility...

883
00:56:32,540 --> 00:56:34,241
and hurting the company.

884
00:56:34,710 --> 00:56:35,911
However,

885
00:56:35,911 --> 00:56:39,281
do you really think my apology will make the readers...

886
00:56:40,250 --> 00:56:41,480
read our magazine again?

887
00:56:43,250 --> 00:56:44,951
I'll take responsibility for what happened.

888
00:56:50,491 --> 00:56:51,560
How?

889
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:56,601
First of all, I'll ask our readers to understand my situation.

890
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:58,101
"Understand"?

891
00:57:00,670 --> 00:57:01,801
Ms. Jang.

892
00:57:02,471 --> 00:57:05,701
This isn't a piece of advice. It's an order.

893
00:57:05,971 --> 00:57:08,670
I want you to stop our readers from complaining so much!

894
00:57:08,871 --> 00:57:10,911
We're not getting any advertisements because of you.

895
00:57:14,281 --> 00:57:15,781
If there's a decrease in sales,

896
00:57:16,781 --> 00:57:18,281
will I get suspended again?

897
00:57:18,451 --> 00:57:19,451
No.

898
00:57:21,851 --> 00:57:23,391
This time, you'll get fired.

899
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:31,931
What should I do?

900
00:57:32,301 --> 00:57:33,971
Why are you asking me? It's not my responsibility.

901
00:57:36,330 --> 00:57:38,770
Hurry up and decide. Are you going to write a column or not?

902
00:57:39,971 --> 00:57:43,681
I could get fired. Give me some time to think.

903
00:57:45,781 --> 00:57:47,951
I need to help my husband take care of the children. Go home.

904
00:57:47,951 --> 00:57:48,980
Okay.

905
00:57:52,451 --> 00:57:54,321
Don't trust Mr. Joo.

906
00:57:55,551 --> 00:57:56,860
He's a jerk, too.

907
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:01,761
Hey, honey.

908
00:58:02,591 --> 00:58:04,730
Did her fever go down, honey?

909
00:58:08,031 --> 00:58:09,301
I know, honey.

910
00:58:10,641 --> 00:58:11,741
I love you, honey.

911
00:58:16,471 --> 00:58:19,210
Hello? We don't know the details.

912
00:58:19,210 --> 00:58:20,750
Okay, bye. Sorry.

913
00:58:26,351 --> 00:58:28,420
Just block them from leaving comments on our website.

914
00:58:28,451 --> 00:58:29,851
That's impossible.

915
00:58:29,851 --> 00:58:32,491
Most people are just calling to curse at us.

916
00:58:32,491 --> 00:58:35,190
Gosh, why do I need to hear them curse at me?

917
00:58:35,591 --> 00:58:37,500
We should sue them for slander.

918
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:39,360
Let's start by suing them for obstruction of business.

919
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:40,931
I can't do any work because of them.

920
00:58:41,630 --> 00:58:43,571
That's a great excuse to quit.

921
00:58:46,871 --> 00:58:49,371
Not enough to actually make me quit.

922
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:52,110
That's a pity.

923
00:58:54,551 --> 00:58:57,380
I'm going to go home now. Don't overwork yourselves already.

924
00:58:59,621 --> 00:59:00,621
And...

925
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:03,560
I'm sorry.

926
00:59:08,431 --> 00:59:10,531
I'm sorry for making you take care of my mess.

927
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:13,471
I told you that I'm your future, but I take it back.

928
00:59:15,830 --> 00:59:17,241
I don't want any of you to go through this.

929
00:59:19,101 --> 00:59:21,940
Forget it. Just buy us some food before you go.

930
00:59:24,681 --> 00:59:25,810
I'll buy you something nice.

Hey, Mom.

933
00:59:50,741 --> 00:59:53,371
Mom, what happened to your hair? You said you'll be back tomorrow.

934
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:55,040
You brat!

935
00:59:59,241 --> 01:00:02,351
Why did you ask me to buy you squid? You're only going to drink more!

936
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:06,991
Do you know how hard it was to...

937
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:11,420
I fell while trying to buy that.

938
01:00:13,931 --> 01:00:14,991
Sorry.

939
01:00:24,170 --> 01:00:26,040
Don't let yourself feel small just because I'm angry at you.

940
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:31,380
And don't blame yourself or feel like you made a mistake...

941
01:00:32,341 --> 01:00:33,511
just because people badmouth you.

942
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:39,020
I know very well that you did nothing wrong.

943

(Dachae Media)

944
01:01:00,741 --> 01:01:01,810
Ms. Jang.

945
01:01:02,071 --> 01:01:05,681
Did you write an apology? Today's the due date.

946
01:01:08,051 --> 01:01:11,520
Ms. Jang, just write an apology.

947
01:01:12,051 --> 01:01:14,491
Our clients are really angry.

948
01:01:14,891 --> 01:01:17,761
They might withdraw their ads starting from next month.

949
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:22,091
If I publish an apology, will they change their minds?

950
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:25,500
It's important to take action.

951
01:01:25,860 --> 01:01:28,431
We need to show them that we're sorry and that we'll do well...

952
01:01:28,801 --> 01:01:29,900
and that they can trust us.

953
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:32,270
That's the only way I'll be able to convince them.

954
01:01:33,141 --> 01:01:35,071
Just do what's best for everyone.

955
01:01:35,971 --> 01:01:39,841
Mr. Kim, I don't think my apology will solve everything.

956
01:01:40,210 --> 01:01:43,480
If I admit that I made a mistake, they'll use that to withdraw the ad.

957
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:46,281
I'm not doing this to save my pride.

958
01:01:50,290 --> 01:01:52,190
Do you at least have a solution to this?

959
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:55,630
Yes.

960
01:02:14,511 --> 01:02:15,980
I have endometriosis.

961
01:02:16,750 --> 01:02:18,221
My ovaries are 40 years old.

962
01:02:21,221 --> 01:02:22,621
And the possibility for me to get naturally pregnant...

963
01:02:22,621 --> 01:02:23,721
is less than seven percent.

964
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:29,630
I'm subfertile.

965
01:02:42,511 --> 01:02:44,480
That's ours, right? Let me take that.

(Am I not allowed to have a baby without getting married?)

968
01:03:22,181 --> 01:03:25,380
I'm subfertile.

969
01:03:27,790 --> 01:03:29,321
I'm 39 years old.

970
01:03:30,661 --> 01:03:32,161
And I'm single.

971
01:03:34,931 --> 01:03:36,290
My love for babies...

972
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:39,000
prevents me from quitting my job at a baby magazine company.

973
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,230
That's the kind of person I am.

974
01:03:42,531 --> 01:03:44,071
As I'm about to turn 40,

975
01:03:45,571 --> 01:03:47,710
I found myself at a crossroad where I might have to give up...

976
01:03:47,710 --> 01:03:48,940
on getting married and pregnant.

977
01:03:49,871 --> 01:03:51,610
And that really made me want to have a baby.

978
01:03:53,141 --> 01:03:56,451
My doctor told me that I should get pregnant within six months.

979
01:03:57,781 --> 01:04:00,121
And it felt like that was how much time I had left to live.

980
01:04:01,391 --> 01:04:03,491
Growing up, I was always an obedient student.

981
01:04:04,621 --> 01:04:08,230
So I chose to listen to my doctor.

982
01:04:10,531 --> 01:04:13,900
If you ask me why I'm taking things this far to have a baby,

983
01:04:17,701 --> 01:04:19,341
I honestly don't know what to say.

984
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:23,471
I just like babies,

985
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:26,580
and I want to become a mom.

986
01:04:28,110 --> 01:04:29,610
How else can I explain that?

987
01:04:31,781 --> 01:04:33,380
I don't know...

988
01:04:34,491 --> 01:04:35,991
what's right and wrong.

989
01:04:38,621 --> 01:04:42,230
I just think my efforts...

990
01:04:42,991 --> 01:04:45,900
will become a process to find the right answer.

991
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:48,871
(I'd like to share my story with you...)

992
01:04:48,871 --> 01:04:50,500
I'd like to share my story with you...

993
01:04:51,301 --> 01:04:52,871
every month...

994
01:04:52,871 --> 01:04:54,270
(I'd like to share my story with you every month...)

995
01:04:54,270 --> 01:04:56,670
and find the answer to this together.

996
01:04:56,670 --> 01:05:01,051
(and find the answer to this together.)

997
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:11,190
(Am I not allowed to have a baby without getting married?)

998
01:05:11,190 --> 01:05:12,690
Am I not allowed...

999
01:05:14,661 --> 01:05:17,130
to have a baby without getting married?

1000
01:05:44,721 --> 01:05:48,290
(Dr. Moon, Urology)

1001
01:06:02,471 --> 01:06:04,110
What brings you here, Mr. Han?

1002
01:06:07,610 --> 01:06:08,610
Well...

1003
01:06:16,091 --> 01:06:17,620
Is there a way for me...

1004
01:06:19,820 --> 01:06:20,891
to have a baby?

1005
01:06:48,351 --> 01:06:51,091
(Oh My Baby)

1006
01:06:51,091 --> 01:06:53,221
It's me you want, right?

1007
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:55,261
- I'll give you mine. - What?

1008
01:06:55,460 --> 01:06:58,101
I want to be good for you.

1009
01:06:58,931 --> 01:07:01,530
- Did you sleep with him? - Don't be ridiculous.

1010
01:07:01,731 --> 01:07:02,931
I thought about it...

1011
01:07:02,931 --> 01:07:05,101
while factoring in our friendship of 39 years.

1012
01:07:05,301 --> 01:07:08,271
There's no reason for me to deny your last wish.

1013
01:07:08,670 --> 01:07:09,740
I'll marry you.

1014
01:07:09,740 --> 01:07:10,941
Of course not.

1015
01:07:11,380 --> 01:07:13,540
I had no idea my heart would ache this much for you.

1016
01:07:13,981 --> 01:07:16,250
Ms. Jang, consider this...

1017
01:07:17,181 --> 01:07:18,250
as a stamp.

1018
01:07:19,420 --> 01:07:20,420
Good job.
