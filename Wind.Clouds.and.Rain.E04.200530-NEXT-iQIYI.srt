1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:10,719
I said take the shot.

2
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:11,729
<i>Previously</i>

3
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:12,925
<i>Please stop!</i>

4
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:14,899
<i>Young Lord Chun-Jung is different.</i>

5
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:16,155
<i>It's as if he shines.</i>

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,665
You do remember what I told you?!

7
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:24,539
<i>you cannot let others know</i>

8
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:26,165
<i>that you can see people's futures.</i>

9
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:28,679
<i>But it is also a curse...</i>

10
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,609
<i>if people find out about your gift.</i>

11
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:34,545
<i>You can never reveal
your abilities to others!</i>

12
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:37,015
You are the one who perishes!

13
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:41,045
So, you are the one with
the real gift, not your mother?

14
00:00:43,789 --> 00:00:44,619
Bong-Ryun!

15
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:46,259
Mother!

16
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,725
<i>Could you possibly
still remember me?</i>

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,095
<i>I've waited 5 years, upon the hill
with the ribbon tied to the tree.</i>

18
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,395
Bong-Ryun!

19
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,195
How dare you put
your hands on her!

20
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,139
<i>The fireflies came to greet
you as well.</i>

21
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,735
It really must be you,
my Bong-Ryun.

22
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:03,309
What are you doing?

23
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:05,475
Write the royal order.

24
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:09,245
Our family's future depends on
your mission in Ganghwa.

25
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,345
<i>And we must get rid of Kyung Choi.</i>

26
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:18,525
Jangdong Kim-Moon' Family
your marriage with the princess.

27
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:25,199
<i>Arrest Kyung Choi for hiding explosives
in the ship headed to Hanyang!</i>

28
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,225
Father!

29
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:30,935
<i>Once he arrives, a fair investigation
will reveal the truth.</i>

30
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:36,074
As princess, can you vouch for
what he is saying?

31
00:01:36,139 --> 00:01:40,675
I witnessed Kyung Choi and his men
move gun powder onto the ship.

32
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,549
Bong-Ryun!

33
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:44,119
<i>Lower your head and
live in secrecy.</i>

34
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,315
You must keep your life!

35
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:47,445
Father!

36
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,789
<i>Promise me!</i>

37
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:57,755
Promise that you will
not kill him!

38
00:01:58,329 --> 00:02:01,899
<i>If you ever betray our family
or try to run from us,</i>

39
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:06,905
<i>your mother and Chun-Jung
will be slaughtered!</i>

40
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:11,379
<i>I will wait patiently,
and never forget...</i>

41
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,578
<i>I will avenge my father's death.</i>

42
00:02:13,579 --> 00:02:15,319
Go find Chun-Jung Choi!

43
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:20,415
Do you think you can find
the next Young Lord of Ganghwa?

44
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,915
<i>Are you looking for someone
with the potential to be King?</i>

45
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,289
<i>The King has fallen ill,</i>

46
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:29,825
<i>royal families
will begin to seek power.</i>

47
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,825
I have the best luck today!

48
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:35,195
Please forgive me!

49
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,305
<i>What a remarkable face.</i>

50
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:40,965
What are you doing here?

51
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:45,709
Why do you come meet a fortune teller
and give false information?

52
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,174
<i>Heungseon-gun, that man...</i>

53
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:51,075
<i>He's been living recklessly
for some time now.</i>

54
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,559
<i>True king's potential is
within that girl!</i>

55
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,629
<i>She is a servant working
at the Wallsong-ru Concubine house.</i>

56
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,685
<i>No one knows her name or address.</i>

57
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,999
<i>Why would Bong-Ryun betray me?</i>

58
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,025
<i>This question is stuck in my head.</i>

59
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:07,929
<i>If you cannot forget her
and seek after her</i>

60
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:12,635
<i>she will kill you
and complete her destiny.</i>

61
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,875
<i>Episode 4</i>

62
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:35,325
My Lord!

63
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:06,925
My Lord Chun-Jung.

64
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,795
Please stay!

65
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,695
My Lord!

66
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,805
Let go of me!

67
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:26,205
Why? You grabbed me.

68
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:31,019
It really is you, Lord Chun-Jung

69
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,019
If I wasn't Chun-Jung Choi,

70
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,315
you would be beaten or hurt.

71
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:38,085
If I was Chun-Jung Choi,

72
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,955
you would die.

73
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,595
What do you choose?

74
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,199
My Lord...

75
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,695
You should at least check

76
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:54,805
that I am still human
and not a rabid animal.

77
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:58,504
before you grabbed me.

78
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,115
I don't want to know why
you betrayed me.

79
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,754
Finding the truth
will not bring my father back

80
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,225
So just...

81
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:16,595
Go live your life

82
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,115
Thank you,

83
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,515
for being alive...

84
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,725
<i>If you do not forget her
and go looking for her</i>

85
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:24,195
She will kill you
and complete her destiny!

86
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:47,115
He's no ordinary Master!
I agree sir.

87
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:54,729
I was wondering
why the city was empty,

88
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:56,225
everyone's down here.

89
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,199
Please move aside!

90
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,499
Move! Move along!

91
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,899
What is everyone doing?

92
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,899
- Can't you tell?
- What is all this?

93
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,009
You guys refugees rom Qing dynasty?

94
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:11,805
Your lives are useless readings
won't change that.

95
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,619
Aren't you the Red Monk?
What are you doing?

96
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,915
Are you trying to interrupt
our business?

97
00:07:23,159 --> 00:07:25,825
Hasn't our master saved your life?

98
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:29,125
That is true, thanks...

99
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,899
Hey!

100
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,999
You stinky little brat! Back off!

101
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,299
Whatever,

102
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,399
go easy on him.

103
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,709
Yes, boss!
I'll 'Go easy on him!'

104
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:40,805
Easy huh?

105
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:49,519
What are you doing?

106
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,815
Piss off!

107
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,319
You idiots!
Literally go easy, relax!

108
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,015
Hey!

109
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,815
Why! You!

110
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:00,825
Idiot!

111
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:05,894
Don't ever touch my brother again!
You crooked monk!

112
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,795
Sister!

113
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,395
Boss, you alright?

114
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:17,305
What? What's wrong?

115
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:24,115
You are the first woman
to treat me like this.

116
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,515
What?

117
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,415
Suddenly in love?

118
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:31,685
You like her?

119
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:33,925
You do like her!

120
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:37,695
He likes her!
Look at him blush!

121
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,995
Your cheeks are brighter
than a bride's!

122
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:49,405
Silence! Shut up!

123
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:53,905
I'll let it slide this time.

124
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,215
Let's go...

125
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,815
I said easy! Easy!

126
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,115
He said go easy!

127
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,925
Stay, get your other side beat too!

128
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,429
Where are you going?

129
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:14,799
Out the back.

130
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,495
You just got back.

131
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,035
I have some unfinished business...

132
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,305
Come on now...

133
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:24,009
You kept me in that room
since I woke up,

134
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:25,905
I've been fortune telling all day!

135
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:27,875
This is a prison!

136
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,119
You're right, it is a prison.

137
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,415
Day and night,
money generating prison!

138
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,229
If I can stay with you
I could be locked up here forever

139
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:41,025
You... crazy...

140
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,399
Don't be like that!
My Master look over there!

141
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,899
Look at that long line!
Over there too!

142
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:48,799
How desperate must they be,

143
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,239
to wait here for more than
10 hours since the morning!

144
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,535
<i>5 Sijin
Roughly 10 hours</i>

145
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:01,705
Just up to them.

146
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,615
OK!

147
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,819
<i>Listen up, I'm sorry to inform you all</i>

148
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,219
<i>we are done for today!</i>

149
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:13,225
<i>We've waited all day!
Please, up to us?</i>

150
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:19,595
Will I pass the state exams this time?

151
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,995
How many years have you tried?

152
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:28,205
This would be my 10th...

153
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:32,645
But it's because I've been very unlucky.

154
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,245
Unlucky you say...

155
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,819
So unlucky you gets to live off of

156
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,419
your little sister working
at the prostitute house,

157
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:44,885
pouring drinks, selling her smile?
While you study?

158
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:50,229
How did you know where I work?

159
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:52,799
Your clothes are old,
your face is full of worries

160
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,495
yet your hair smells of perfume.

161
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,699
Last night you were busy pouring drinks,

162
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,805
and this morning you just changed
your clothes? Right?

163
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:03,305
Yes, Master.

164
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:07,005
Our mother is sick too.

165
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,419
Hey, fortune teller,

166
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:13,819
I've seriously worked hard.
I've done everything I can.

167
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,659
And yet you still fail?

168
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:19,329
Listen, I've spoken to other fortune tellers

169
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:22,925
They said I was unlucky to
constantly fail but...

170
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,995
I feel like my luck is changing...
So now...

171
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,295
You think I'll pass?

172
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:40,505
If you really studied hard...

173
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:45,375
Maybe your birth date
and time are wrong.

174
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,515
And as for your exam...

175
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,325
I will not say.

176
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:54,585
Huh?

177
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:57,595
I will refund your money.

178
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,795
Here's some more,
for your 10 hour long wait.

179
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,505
This is worth 5 times more than
my payment.

180
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:09,805
My apologies.

181
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:13,005
You can't be serious.

182
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,415
- Older brother!
- What?

183
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,115
Stop talking.

184
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,905
Those siblings from earlier.

185
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,105
Why'd you just send them?

186
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:48,705
<i>His destiny is like a candle flickering
in the winter wind.</i>

187
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,615
Within fortune telling,
he is an unsolvable problem.

188
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:55,515
Weak both in the mind and body.

189
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,915
A candle in the winter...

190
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,425
A candle in the wind

191
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:04,195
Easily blown out?

192
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:10,999
He has good parents
but he think's he is of greatness.

193
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,005
Unaware of his limitations
like a candle on the damp ground.

194
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:18,105
He is lazy and thrill seeking.

195
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:21,405
But the odd thing is...

196
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:25,019
For the past 10 years,

197
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:28,049
something has protected his flame,

198
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:30,815
Luck?
He had good luck?

199
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,925
He said he had bad luck
and flunked the exams.

200
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:36,425
That's why it is odd.

201
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,095
Is that why you didn't read his future?

202
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:45,099
Out of all the bad people,
do you know who

203
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,109
Nope.

204
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:48,105
The weakest and most untalented.

205
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:52,805
Afraid to be outed,
carries a knife around.

206
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:55,205
When threatened,
swings his knife around.

207
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,919
So a fight that could end with fists,

208
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,115
becomes a cold murder scene.

209
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,715
That's the kind of future awaiting him.

210
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:08,825
Acting out extremely to hide
his weakness.

211
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:11,499
Avoiding him is best.

212
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:15,799
Anyways, does this guy pass the exam?
Does he fail?

213
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,609
What's it to you?
I didn't accept his money.

214
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:24,105
Come on, just tell me.
You already know, just tell me huh?

215
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,219
<i>Jangdong Kim-Moon Jwa-Keun Kim’s residence</i>

216
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:37,015
I opened my eyes this morning
to this beautiful weather.

217
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,359
Which is why

218
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,529
<i>Nahab (Jwa-Keun Kim’s concubine)</i>

219
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:42,955
I sent out messages
for all you noble women

220
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,899
It's my honor
that every single misses showed up.

221
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:50,399
Who are we to ever deny you Ma'am.

222
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,599
Yes, Ma'am.

223
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,905
Of course, we came.

224
00:14:57,010 --> 00:15:00,005
<i>My lady, Princess Wha-Ryun is here.</i>

225
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:01,349
What?

226
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:04,015
Princess?
The princess is here?

227
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:21,095
I don't recall sending a message
to the princess...

228
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,895
What brings you here?

229
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,795
Am I not allowed to be here?

230
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,905
That is not what I mean...

231
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:30,609
I heard all the noble women
were gathering.

232
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:32,205
So I came to greet everyone.

233
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:35,509
A kind gesture, your highness

234
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:37,415
Absolutely beautiful!

235
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,015
Yes, yes...

236
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,825
I hear your mother passed away early,

237
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:51,095
no one to have taught you
womanly manners.

238
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,695
Maybe we can teach you.

239
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:21,929
How does a former prostitute mock
our princess's origins

240
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:24,695
It is ironic that she thinks
she's above others.

241
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,199
Move aside.

242
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,795
Please sit.

243
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:37,204
Although I do not know
my womanly manners,

244
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:41,605
I would still enjoy
talking with all of you.

245
00:16:44,119 --> 00:16:45,749
By any chance,

246
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:49,015
Have you heard
about the ugly prostitute's love story?

247
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,285
Excuse me?

248
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:56,425
<i>Once lived an ugly prostitute who secretly</i>

249
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:00,195
<i>loved a handsome noble man.</i>

250
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,799
<i>She successfully called
the noble man out</i>

251
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,305
<i>to meet her by the water well.</i>

252
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:15,109
My Lord? My Lord!

253
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:16,415
My Lord!

254
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,215
Let go of me!

255
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,015
My Lord!

256
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:26,289
My Lord!

257
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:28,255
<i>She was rejected harshly.</i>

258
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:32,795
How she pleaded and begged.

259
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,695
Her nickname became
'Pants grabber'

260
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:46,609
Her colleagues and clients all
began calling her

261
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:50,519
'Pants grabber', ugly 'Pants grabber'.

262
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:54,015
What a sad and tragic tale.

263
00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:01,429
Who on earth is this ugly prostitute?

264
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:03,595
- Who?
- Who is it?

265
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,495
She is...

266
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:09,495
- Who is she?
- Who?

267
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:11,965
She is...

268
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,309
Oh no, my dress!

269
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,909
Is there anyone outside?

270
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:21,905
I just bought this yesterday!

271
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:35,325
How did you know!

272
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:39,999
No one knows about my past,

273
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,795
No can knows anymore!

274
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,509
Lord Haok used to tell us that

275
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:49,405
the princess had abilities to
look into people's hearts...

276
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,609
Is this true?

277
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:55,105
As you said, my mother
never taught me womanly manners.

278
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,815
but she taught me other skills.

279
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:05,415
The nobleman you loved
is now a prosecutor.

280
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:10,495
He has no idea you are
'Pants grabber' either.

281
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,315
You wrote a letter to him,

282
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,345
with loving heart.

283
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:44,995
What will happen
if the Lord Haok finds out?

284
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,199
Every time I see
something devious from you,

285
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,595
will I have to tell the Lord?

286
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:02,505
Finally showing your true colors.

287
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,715
What do you want?

288
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:11,515
Riches? Men?

289
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,325
My life?

290
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:17,895
What could I do with your life?

291
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:23,095
All I need is a room.

292
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,505
A room in the Wallsong-ru prostitute house.

293
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:32,205
What?

294
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,519
Miss! Miss!

295
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,119
I only provided you with one fact,

296
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,329
Na-Hab recently sent drinks
to the prosecutor's office

297
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:50,595
How did you get the Wallsong-ru room

298
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:57,399
I saw Na-Hab's face
within one of the employees

299
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,695
Pardon?

300
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:02,105
You're amazing!

301
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:05,905
But what are you trying to do

302
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:08,905
Look for the girl.

303
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,915
That girl...

304
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,815
Will become my weapon.

305
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,199
My my, when will it stop snowing?

306
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,495
Where are you going?

307
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:33,309
My Master, I am going to get you health
prolonging medicine before the winter comes!

308
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:37,309
Why? So you can work me
day and night?

309
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:40,009
Working hard makes you rich too!

310
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:41,505
Hello?

311
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,819
Have you come for medicine?

312
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,115
Yes.

313
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,305
What are you staring at?
Let's go in.

314
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:10,609
Owner! Let's see...

315
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:12,875
- Please come in.
- Give me the best in value not price!

316
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:43,509
Thank you for stopping by!

317
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:45,605
Yeah, sure.

318
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,815
Give this to your mother.

319
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:54,815
This is expensive herbal soup
your going to give it to her?

320
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:03,125
She has great respect and posture.
She is a well taught daughter of a noble.

321
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:06,899
With skinny wrists,
too weak to properly cut the herbs,

322
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,525
she is of a poor starving family,

323
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:17,809
Use this to help feed your family.

324
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:19,305
Do not refuse out of pride.

325
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:26,615
Noble?

326
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,015
Master!

327
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,355
<i>Are you mad?</i>

328
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:35,925
<i>Master!</i>

329
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:45,699
Why are you over the top charitable?

330
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,605
Do you think I was being charitable?

331
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:51,609
That child back there
is destined for greatness.

332
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:53,305
She looked normal to me.

333
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:56,105
What? She's got
the face of an empress?

334
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:00,019
Who knows if
she will become an empress

335
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:00,919
We shall have to see.

336
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:04,115
My goodness,
even if you're a Master,

337
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,729
you just wasted that herbal soup
and money

338
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:08,825
Such a waste.

339
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:12,895
My wrists are skinny too.
Look!

340
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,265
<i>Changdeokgung Injeongjeon</i>

341
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,005
My illness is worsening,

342
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:23,905
and I am worried about
who will take over.

343
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:28,049
I plan on passing
the crown to a relative

344
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:29,645
<i>Cheoljong
25th King of the Joseon Dynasty</i>

345
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,079
<i>Haok Jwa-Keun Kim (Prime Minister)</i>

346
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,715
I will like to know
your thoughts on the matter.

347
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,415
My King you are still young.

348
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,959
An abdication? Not just sire!

349
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,959
<i>Byung-Woon Kim (Minster of Finance)</i>

350
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,225
That is enough.

351
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:48,195
I have made up my mind!

352
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:54,509
Go and find a relative of
good morals and wisdom.

353
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:58,405
Help the kingdom and find
my successor!

354
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,395
My King,

355
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,569
How could you speak of abdication?

356
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:27,635
<i>Queen Jo
Queen Mother Hyoyu</i>

357
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:32,905
Everyone knew this was coming.

358
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:36,205
If we do not quickly find a successor,

359
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:39,815
I will be a sinner to
this country and the throne.

360
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,215
Alright.

361
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:46,015
Your Majesty
I would like to introduce you to someone.

362
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:52,395
Gyeongwon-gun, Ha-Jeon Lee.

363
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:55,699
<i>Gyeongwon-gun Ha-Jeon Lee</i>

364
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,995
Ha-Jeon Lee,
an honor to meet you my King.

365
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:04,405
Now, you do not have to worry about
a successor.

366
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:06,909
Ha-Jeon here is a fine young man...

367
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:10,215
Who will proudly
lead the country as the new king?

368
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:39,905
- Stop.
- Everyone Stop.

369
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,715
It's been a long time, my Lord.

370
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,219
It sure has.

371
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:51,615
You did not show up to
the princess' gathering.

372
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:57,499
My second child had fallen ill and...

373
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:02,095
I had to pawn off my coat
leaving me with nothing to wear.

374
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:06,235
If I could borrow some money
for my child's medicine...

375
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:11,105
A king's relative borrowing money
from a Lord...

376
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:16,615
- Servant Jang.
- Yes, my Lord.

377
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,115
Let's go.

378
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,595
<i>Stop!</i>

379
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:42,405
Halt.

380
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:01,825
Let him go.

381
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,495
Are you not Lord Kim?

382
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,595
This vulgar servant works
for you my Lord?

383
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,439
I will pay for his sins,
to end your troubles.

384
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:20,905
Before anything,
he must beg for forgiveness.

385
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:33,215
Please forgive me, my Lord!

386
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:38,125
This is the Lee Family's Joseon Dynasty.

387
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,995
Do not ever forget that!

388
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,095
Yes, Lord.

389
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:52,709
Apologies my Lord.

390
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:56,519
We were about to leave.

391
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,515
Come on, we're leaving!

392
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,425
Show your respects.

393
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,795
He is Chi-Seong Yeon, my guardian warrior

394
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:19,695
Although he's the son of a concubine

395
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:24,505
His face might be fair
but he is a fierce warrior.

396
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:27,705
He sure had strength.

397
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:29,945
Leave us.

398
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:41,229
If I think back,
the servant begging brings me joy.

399
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:42,625
What about you?

400
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,595
You shouldn't be that way.

401
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:53,099
You should never provoke them,
they are like beasts.

402
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:56,805
It'll be alright. Please do not worry.

403
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:01,509
Recently the Queen Mother

404
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:05,415
has requested
for a renowned and respected

405
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:07,915
I am disappointed.

406
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:11,315
Even the Queen Mother believes
in these readings.

407
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:16,125
That isn't it.

408
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:19,399
When it comes to politics,

409
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:24,695
the people want to believe
in legends and dreams.

410
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,005
Let's see...

411
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:36,915
Someone does come to mind...

412
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:51,325
Queen Mother,
the person you have been looking for.

413
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:04,205
Are you Mu-Myung Choi?

414
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,275
Yes, my Queen Mother.

415
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:12,615
Our business here today
shall never be spoken of.

416
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:15,315
Yes, My Queen Mother.

417
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:40,909
Stop!

418
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:42,649
You dare laugh at me?
A King's bloodline?

419

<i>Jae-Geung Lee
Heungin-gun</i>

420
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:48,015
If you ever make me angry again
I will kill you

421
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:18,919
<i>My Lord.</i>

00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,489

427
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,355
What do you think?

428
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:03,325
One is of immense greatness,

429
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:09,365
and the other loves alcohol and women.

430
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:17,575
May I ask
who these birth dates belong to?

431
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:24,975
Do not question!
She is the Queen Mother!

432
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,419
I have already warned you,

433
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:32,419
What happened today shall
never be spoken of.

434
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,625
You may leave now.

435
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:36,024
Yes, Queen Mother.

Here it is!

439
00:34:07,929 --> 00:34:11,095
You must be careful of men!

440
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,895
The man you see right now...

441
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,195
is worthless right?

442
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,908
Oh! She's amazing! Truly!

443
00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:25,005
Throw him out and find
a new man.

- sure, sure.

445
00:34:28,410 --> 00:34:31,615
Leave in peace. Now, next!

446
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:38,115
Let's see... Let's see...

447
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:42,459
The foreign fortune telling
is very popular!

448
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:44,325
Really?

449
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,505
Excuse me...

Sorry...

00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:48,625
Pardon?

453
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,995
I have come to your urgent request.

454
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:58,095
You have read
Lord Heungseon-gun's destiny?

455
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,795
Who are you?

456
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:11,015
<i>Ministry of Justice
Responsible for prisoning criminals
and guarding them</i>

457
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,315
Payment for helping the government.

458
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:20,019
Government?

459
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:21,925
What has Heungseon-gun said?

460
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:25,595
What was his destiny?
Tell me everything you know.

461
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,205
I am a lowly fortune teller,
but I read people's lives.

462
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:39,405
I will not share
their privacy with others.

463
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:40,905
Excuse me.

464
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:46,319
You dare deny
the government's request?

465
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,915
If the government wishes to learn
about Heungseon-gun,

466
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,715
tell your superiors
to come find me themselves.

467
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:59,195
If they put in the effort
maybe I'll tell you.

468
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,695
I work with the lady shaman.

469
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,099
if you tell me your story,

470
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,235
I will make sure to tell the shaman.

471
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:45,339
It's fine.
I do not need my future read.

472
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:47,105
Everything will be alright.

473
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:50,405
What do you mean?

474
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:55,345
A man promised my brother
that he would make sure

475
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:57,815
Pass the state exam?

476
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,255
Who has said that to you?

477
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:06,495
Our mother has fallen ill
trying to take care of us.

478
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:10,099
We had to sell her house as well.

479
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:14,505
My brother felt horrible and responsible,

480
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:17,105
because he was just unlucky
for the past 10 years.

481
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:21,805
No matter how hard he tried
he couldn't catch a break.

482
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:25,819
So they sent me off
to some Lord's place

483
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:27,615
in exchange for some money...

484
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,415
And paid off a high official.

485
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,125
A man of the Jandong Kim-Moon' Family.

486
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,995
You must get your money back
from that family at once!

487
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,699
<i>Would they simply give it back?</i>

488
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,809
<i>I will help you.</i>

489
00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:50,105
<i>Get the money back and run away!</i>

490
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:52,709
<i>- Run away?
- That is...</i>

491
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:54,305
I'm fine right now!

492
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:57,515
I've always wanted to learn
about herbal medicine.

493
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:00,219
When my brother passes his exams
and becomes an official,

494
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:02,245
he promised to pay me back.

495
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:06,715
Then I can be free and live my life.

496
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:09,825
I will live happily.

497
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:18,765
Do not forget your dreams.

498
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,805
No matter what happens...

499
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:26,305
You might find yourself stranded

500
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:30,005
and lonely on
a dangerous cliff one day...

501
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:36,615
<i>I've lost someone
in a similar situation.</i>

502
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:42,925
I hope someone will be
there for you.

503
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,695
I will pray for you.

504
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:30,305
What of the task
my father has requested?

505
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:36,305
Finding the next Lord of Ganghwa
you mean?

506
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:42,115
I have not seen anyone.
No one among the relatives.

507
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:45,355
I'm sure that is.

508
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:49,525
It must be difficult to find a child
with such potential.

509
00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:52,225
I have had a strange dream recently,

510
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,795
and would like to discuss it with you.

511
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:02,805
What is it?

512
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:07,805
I saw the Choi Family's Chun-Jung.

513
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:14,019
Chun-Jung despised me
from the darkness.

514
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:15,915
But suddenly the darkness disappeared.

515
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:24,455
Are you... chasing after him?

516
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:29,695
It's been 3 years
since I've heard his name.

517
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,805
Alright then, I believe you.

518
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:41,705
But... you cannot forget our agreement.

519
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:45,215
Betraying Kyung Choi
for our Kim-Moon Family

520
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:49,015
in exchange for Chun-Jung Choi's life?

521
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:55,025
Do not worry,
we haven't killed him.

522
00:41:56,430 --> 00:42:00,495
If he is still alive
you should be worried princess.

523
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:04,995
I bet he will come after you.

524
00:42:15,810 --> 00:42:20,415
If I was Chun-Jung Choi
you would die.

525
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:25,515
So just go live your life!

526
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:11,999
Where's mine?

527
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,295
Eat later.

528
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,609
Mine!

529
00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:18,105
Master, have some breakfast!

530
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:21,405
Sit here and have some breakfast.

531
00:43:21,610 --> 00:43:23,005
Please, take a seat.

532
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:26,615
Here...

533
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:29,915
Try the soup! My goodness!

534
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:33,919
Master, as you have requested.

535
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:37,025
I have looked into the man who failed
his exams for 10 years.

536
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:42,525
He is an arrogant scum student,
living off of his parents.

537
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:47,299
There is a street
where many students live.

538
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:50,705
He resides with traveling students.

539
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:57,109
<i>Has his own private room.</i>

540
00:43:57,110 --> 00:43:59,215
<i>His mother and younger sister
send him money,</i>

541
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:03,315
<i>With that money he gets drunk
and wakes up late.</i>

542
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:07,725
<i>He lies that he is tired from studies
but in reality</i>

543
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:14,099
<i>he spends all his time gambling
and drinking with other students.</i>

544
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:16,795
<i>All these students become close friends</i>

545
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,995
<i>and spend everyday living like that.</i>

546
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:21,809
I passed!

547
00:44:21,810 --> 00:44:24,005
I passed! I passed!

548
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:31,949
<i>When he first failed he was alright!</i>

549
00:44:31,950 --> 00:44:32,779
Idiots!

550
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:36,015
<i>It was his first time,
surely he would pass on the next...</i>

551
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:40,215
I passed! I passed!
I finally passed!

552
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:47,099
<i>Failing twice became three times,
then four...</i>

553
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:49,595
<i>All his drinking buddies
slowly disappeared.</i>

554
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:52,895
<i>He ended up selling his family home
and had no where to stay.</i>

555
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:55,009
<i>Even if he wanted to be a farmer
like his father,</i>

556
00:44:55,010 --> 00:44:58,205
<i>they had already sold
all their land to support him.</i>

557
00:44:58,810 --> 00:45:01,005
<i>His pride couldn't bare...</i>

558
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:05,815
<i>working for someone else's farm.</i>

559
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:07,149
<i>That's how his 10 years went!</i>

560
00:45:07,150 --> 00:45:09,249
Where are you going brother?

561
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:10,715
Mother is ill!

562
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:13,515
Brother!

563
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:23,195
That's why he blamed luck.

564
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:27,095
'It's not my fault,
I've been unlucky.'

565
00:45:27,610 --> 00:45:29,805
'It's not my fault,
it's my unlucky destiny.'

566
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:34,109
The only way to handle
the pain of his choices.

567
00:45:34,110 --> 00:45:38,619
This time though,
he bribed the Kim-Moon Family.

568
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:40,519
Surely he'd pass right?

569
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:42,119
Just tell us.

570
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:45,419
We're partners, friends!
Tell me!

571
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:48,125
<i>- Anyone inside?
- Yes, who is it?</i>

572
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:51,625
He doesn't even have manners.

573
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:53,695
Eating breakfast?
Fake fortune teller.

574
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:55,899
Been a while huh?

575
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:58,299
Just leave, please.

576
00:45:58,300 --> 00:45:59,695
No!

577
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:03,909
No matter how hard I try not to be,
I'm furious.

578
00:46:03,910 --> 00:46:08,509
You don't even know all the hardships
I've been through

579
00:46:08,510 --> 00:46:12,515
A measly fortune teller
looks down on me?

580
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:17,815
I'll come see
your face once I pass, huh?

581
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:20,815
Your destiny has you hanging yourself.

582
00:46:21,930 --> 00:46:23,329
You really want me to tell you?

583
00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:26,699
Now? All of a sudden?

584
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:32,095
It's for your poor sister and
another woman who cares for her.

585
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:34,095
Go on.

586
00:46:35,110 --> 00:46:36,505
You...

587
00:46:40,370 --> 00:46:43,065
Your destiny has you hanging yourself.

588
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:45,579
You really want me to tell you?

589
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:48,949
Now? All of a sudden?

590
00:46:48,950 --> 00:46:54,345
It's for your poor sister and
another woman who cares for her.

591
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:56,345
Go on.

592
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:58,755
You...

593
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:03,855
fail...

594
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:06,569
Your bribes are useless.

595
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:08,165
And you are doomed to fail.

596
00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:15,369
What?

597
00:47:15,370 --> 00:47:17,775
Go back to the Kim-Moon Family
and ask for your money.

598
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:20,675
It's the only way to save
your mother and sister.

599
00:47:22,550 --> 00:47:28,245
You fake fortune teller...
When I pass

600
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:33,555
I'm going to come back and kill you!
You hear?

601
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,855
What are you looking at?

602
00:47:42,670 --> 00:47:43,965
I'll see you then.

603
00:47:45,170 --> 00:47:48,665
Goodness, what a scumbag.

604
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:57,245
The superiors are planning a celebration
for your promotion

605
00:47:57,550 --> 00:47:59,749
I am not sure if I am worthy to attend.

606
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:02,245
Why would you think that.

607
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:06,059
I thank you and the prosecutors
for my success.

608
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:07,855
You are a dear colleague.

609
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:10,355
Thank you, officer.

610
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:12,055
Let me pour you a drink.

611
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:48,765
What's wrong my Lord?

612
00:48:49,470 --> 00:48:50,765
Nothing.

613
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:03,245
<i>He's come looking for Chun-Jung Choi.</i>

614
00:49:03,450 --> 00:49:05,545
<i>Chun-Jung must be nearby!</i>

615
00:49:06,350 --> 00:49:09,345
Get someone! Help!

616
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:13,455
He's crazy!

617
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,455
You scumbag get out!

618
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:19,355
Damn you!

619
00:49:22,470 --> 00:49:23,869
Back from your acceptance ceremony?

620
00:49:23,870 --> 00:49:25,839
<i>Bangbangre
A list of people who have passed
the state exam</i>

621
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:26,669
You failed?

622
00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:27,565
Yeah!

623
00:49:28,070 --> 00:49:31,175
You wrote a charm and cursed me!
I know you did!

624
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:33,375
Why would I?

625
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:37,449
You blame misfortune now me?

626
00:49:37,450 --> 00:49:42,645
Shut up! It's your fault
you did something to me! Fix it!

627
00:49:42,950 --> 00:49:44,355
There's no point.

628
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:49,555
You will suffer misfortune
for the next 20 years.

629
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:51,359
What?

630
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:55,269
Master! Why are you provoking
a mad man!

631
00:49:55,270 --> 00:49:59,165
- Try stopping him!
- How could I?

632
00:49:59,570 --> 00:50:01,765
Misfortune until I'm 55 years old?

633
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:04,975
Take it back!

634
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:09,745
Sure, I take it back.

635
00:50:11,850 --> 00:50:13,115
Happy?

636
00:50:14,450 --> 00:50:18,855
Whatever I say or don't say
It's purely your destiny.

637
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:20,555
No!

638
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:22,655
I said it isn't!

639
00:50:30,070 --> 00:50:35,165
Listen, the past 10 years,
you were very fortunate.

640
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:40,675
You happily squandered your life away.

641
00:50:41,150 --> 00:50:45,249
Leaving your mother and sister,
to carry your weight.

642
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:47,845
You used up all of your good days.

643
00:50:48,550 --> 00:50:51,455
Lies! This cannot be!
There's no way!

644
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:53,559
For the next 20 years...

645
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:58,755
You will suffer the consequences of
your choices.

646
00:51:03,870 --> 00:51:07,265
Even the most unfortunate succeed.
If they try their best.

647
00:51:08,570 --> 00:51:10,379
But a scum like you...

648
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:15,245
The destiny you trusted?
Will turn it's back.

649
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:19,745
Come out! Get out!

650
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:26,355
Sister! Sister!

651
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,355
<i>We're letting him leave?</i>

652
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:31,955
<i>He's going to make another mess!</i>

653
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:35,669
Let's see... Let's see...

654
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:37,965
It's completely empty today.

655
00:51:38,670 --> 00:51:41,565
Where did Miss go?

656
00:51:41,870 --> 00:51:43,265
Leaving me here alone.

657
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:48,045
Miss! Where'd you go?

658
00:51:48,250 --> 00:51:51,745
The Lady Song-Hwa left this for you.

659
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:02,155
<i>Your hands were very cold.</i>

660
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:06,255
<i>Boil these roots and drink them.
They will help.</i>

661
00:52:07,570 --> 00:52:08,665
It came with these.

662
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:20,875
There will be a horrific accident.

663
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:24,245
We must get her out of there
before it happens.

664
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:26,145
Pardon?

665
00:52:27,050 --> 00:52:28,945
Never mind.

666
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:42,865
<i>What's going on...?</i>

667
00:52:43,870 --> 00:52:45,065
What's wrong?

668
00:52:46,270 --> 00:52:50,475
Dan-Ah, stay here.
I'll be right back.

669
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:51,679
Do not worry.

670
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:54,375
Miss! Miss!

671
00:52:54,950 --> 00:52:56,645
Come on...

672
00:52:56,650 --> 00:52:59,445
Absolutely ruined!

673
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:01,345
This was expensive!

674
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:06,059
What is wrong?

675
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:09,659
Some maniac brother took Song-Hwa
as if he wanted to kill her.

676
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:11,555
He was crazy!

677
00:53:15,770 --> 00:53:18,365
Where's Song-Hwa's house?

678
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:37,585
Song-Hwa...

679
00:53:47,670 --> 00:53:49,069
Sulfur!

680
00:53:49,070 --> 00:53:51,735
<i>Petroleum Sulfur / Crude oil
Often used as the raw material for matches</i>

681
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:01,475
Song-Hwa,
Miss Song-Hwa wake up!

682
00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:02,605
Miss Song-Hwa!

683
00:54:06,250 --> 00:54:07,645
We must leave!

684
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:12,755
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

685
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:16,855
Who are you?

686
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:19,755
Hey!

687
00:54:36,350 --> 00:54:38,545
Who are you? Die!

688
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:46,855
<i>This was it...</i>

689
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:50,955
<i>I was the one to die today...</i>

690
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:53,155
Die!

691
00:55:09,250 --> 00:55:11,145
My Lord...

692
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:33,865
The bruises around your neck
will hurt.

693
00:56:39,170 --> 00:56:40,665
Where are we?

694
00:56:41,570 --> 00:56:43,265
My humble residence.

695
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:46,375
Where's Song-Hwa?

696
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:49,745
Song-Hwa and her mother are safe
thanks to you.

697
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:52,945
Her older brother Song-Jin
visited me today.

698
00:56:54,050 --> 00:56:57,855
I anticipated that he would lash out.

699
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:02,055
He came to you? Why?

700
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:05,855
Because I accurately read him
his destiny.

701
00:57:12,070 --> 00:57:16,465
Are you disappointed?
Because I'm a fortune teller?

702
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,979
I am honored my grace.

703
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:27,445
The princess conversing with
a lowly fortune teller like myself.

704
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:38,255
This way.

705
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:40,155
What?

706
00:57:42,070 --> 00:57:42,925
Why?

707
00:57:43,670 --> 00:57:45,565
Help me stand up.

708
00:57:47,270 --> 00:57:49,065
Your legs were not injured.

709
00:57:49,770 --> 00:57:51,275
I'm certain you can walk on your own.

710
00:57:59,610 --> 00:58:00,905
This way.

711
00:58:01,510 --> 00:58:02,805
What?

712
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:05,575
Why?

713
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:08,215
Help me stand up.

714
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,715
Your legs were not injured.

715
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:13,925
I'm certain you can walk on your own.

716
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:27,905
Are you disappointed?

717
00:58:28,510 --> 00:58:32,005
Yes! Incredibly disappointed!

718
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:44,815
We were friends, then newly weds.

719
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:48,159
You were the commanding family
of Ganghwa,

720
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:50,625
and I was a herb picking
daughter of a shaman.

721
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:56,795
Back then you never treated me
like a peasant.

722
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:00,405
You expect that...

723
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:04,505
I would be different?

724
00:59:37,210 --> 00:59:38,209
<i>Where were you?</i>

725
00:59:38,210 --> 00:59:39,039
I was...

726
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:40,279
I was with the princess!

727
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:42,479
You expect me to believe this?

728
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,719
Should I tell him his son treats
his father's loved ones

729
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:46,179
<i>with absolutely no respect?</i>

730
00:59:46,180 --> 00:59:47,089
Why are you doing this?

731
00:59:47,090 --> 00:59:48,089
I'm investing.

732
00:59:48,090 --> 00:59:50,115
Where is this Master Choi staying?

733
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:52,419
<i>what can we do against
the Kim-Moon Family?</i>

734
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:54,359
We cannot oppose them for orphans.

735
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:57,129
Who is capable of protecting our weak?

736
00:59:57,130 --> 01:00:00,869
I will tell the King
about the nursery children.

737
01:00:00,870 --> 01:00:02,429
What about Heungseon-gun?

738
01:00:02,430 --> 01:00:04,469
<i>The man called
Master Choi will not talk.</i>

739
01:00:04,470 --> 01:00:06,499
<i>What do you ask in return?</i>

740
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:08,469
<i>I was instructed to bring...</i>

741
01:00:08,470 --> 01:00:11,009
<i>To whom does this destiny belong to?</i>

742
01:00:11,010 --> 01:00:12,139
This…

743
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:12,979
This is...

744
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:14,179
Lord Dojeonggung

745
01:00:14,180 --> 01:00:15,679
He does not know to fear the world.

746
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:17,619
<i>His son is
what we are curious about.</i>

747
01:00:17,620 --> 01:00:20,119
<i>When I flip my glass...</i>

748
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:21,149
<i>Kill him.</i>

749
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:25,919
Nobody can deny the world
when it calls upon you.

750
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:27,429
<i>Mark my words.</i>

751
01:00:27,430 --> 01:00:29,129
<i>That is called...</i>

752
01:00:29,130 --> 01:00:31,355
<i>destiny.</i>
