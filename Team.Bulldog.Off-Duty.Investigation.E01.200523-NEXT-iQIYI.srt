You're a program director at OCM.

29
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,610
What kind of a director

30

and a maxed-out credit card?

On top of that, you only have

32
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:56,660
- three dollars in cash.
- It's because I got sued so many times

33
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:59,290
while doing a show on current affairs.

34
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:03,000
I spent all my money on legal fees.

35
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,900
And I borrowed this suit for an interview.

36

Are you moving somewhere?

Why do you drive such an expensive car
when you're penniless?

41
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:24,150
I don't own that car. It's a shared car.

42
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:25,620
You know what carsharing is, right?

43

I'm sorry, sir. I didn't see the inside.

We're almost done digging, sir.

What... What?
You're not going to bury me, are you?

50
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,540
The weather is so cold.

51
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:53,080
You're very quick.
I guess it's because you're a director.

52
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:56,950
We sold most of the girls
who came before you.

53

Then why not me?

54
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:04,130
And we sold the organs
of those who weren't

55

and kidneys are in great condition.

Make sure you bury her nicely.

- Bury her.
- Yes, sir.

81
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:14,700
Why is she crying like a horse?

82
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:18,330
She sounds just like a horse.

What happened? Why did you get caught?

92
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:04,110
I told you, right? My profiling was right.

93
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,950
- What?
- I told you it must be a gang.

94
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:08,020
If they were after money,

95
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:10,320
they wouldn't have stolen
the victims' cars as well.

96
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,920
So I knew there'd be a big organization
behind what has been happening.

97
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,390
- Seriously?
- Hey, who are you?

98
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,030
Are you a cop? A pig?

99
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,930
First of all, let me tell you
that the animal I hate the most

100
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,170
is pigs.

101
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,430
Then who are you? Her husband?

102
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,740
- No way.
- No way.

103
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,940
You guys seem to get along well.

104
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,370
- Do you guys know each other?
- What's going on?

105
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,740

Okay, here's the deal.

108

Let's pretend like nothing happened today.

109
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:45,450
If you guys let us go,

110
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:47,890
I swear we'll keep this quiet.

111
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,060
What do you say?

112
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:52,730
What are you talking about?
That's not a deal.

113
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,660
A deal is when you give and take...

114
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:00,300
What's that on his wrist?

115
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,680
Sir, you're too old
to be making prank calls.

116

This punk is unbelievable.

117
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,750
How embarrassing.

118
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,420
Hey!

119
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,880
My gosh, bury them together.

120
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:48,880
- That hurt.

Hurry up and bury them!

122

- Stop ruining my clothes!
- Why are you so slow?

123
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,690
Put some strength into it.

124

Gosh, this place is so far away.

125

- Who is he?
- Why did you set up shop

126

It was so hard to get here.

Who are you?

128

Do you really want to be doing this
at your age?

129

You kidnap people and steal cars.
It's depressing.

Who are you?

131

Who do you think? I'm a cop.

132
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:24,990
I arrest jerks like you.

133

Unlike you guys, my job covers insurance.

134

Aren't you jealous?

00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:17,510
Let go of me!

144
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:39,560
Gosh. Why are you always running late?

145
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:42,360
Sorry. I had to close up the store.

146
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,100
I'm out of breath after that short walk.

147

Hey, Bare Hands, Tools.
Let's wrap this quickly.

148
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,010
Yes, sir.

149
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,580
You jerk!

150
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:56,800
Who is there?

151
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:59,040
What is this? Are you a woman?

152
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,010
If you underestimate me
because I'm a woman,

153
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:02,910
you'll be sorry.

154
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:30,840
I thought we were going to die, seriously.

155

Why would you get caught?

156
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,410
On your right.

157
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,680
Stop it!

158
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:44,990
Throw it.

159
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,800
My gosh, there are so many of them.

160
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:59,600
Hey, where did all of our guys go?

161
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:01,670
- Let's go through that door.
- Okay.

162
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,870
Where do you think you're going?

163
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:10,810
Gosh, I'm getting exhausted.

164
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,350
Just come with me now.

165
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,050
Darn it. Hey, do something.

491

And add two boxes of organic soap.

497

505
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:28,090
The suspect was a brutal murderer
with an anger management issue.

506
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:29,560
He cut a 20-year-old college student

507
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:31,960
more than 40 times with an ax.

508
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,600
What's unusual is that he left the ax

509
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:37,140
that had his fingerprints on it.

510
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:40,210
We could tell that he wore gloves,

511
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:43,140
but his fingerprints were all over
the murder weapon.

512
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:45,040
Why couldn't they catch the culprit then?

513
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,110
Because we couldn't identify
the fingerprints.

514
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:51,120
So, we focused on minors
and foreign workers at that time.

515
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,590
But there was no match.

516
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:55,290
And the police falsely accused someone
of murder?

517
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,220
When the fingerprints did not match?

518
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:59,360
That's not the most interesting part.

519
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,990
The murder weapon was not the only thing
the suspect left at the scene.

520
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,600
He cut off the victim's hands

521
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:05,360
and displayed them.

522
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,700
That's the key to this case.

523
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:13,040
The victim's two hands left on the scene.

524
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,110
Why?

525
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,140
In cases where the suspect damages
the victim's body,

526
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:18,710
the two are likely to know each other.

527
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,410
Once the victim is identified,
we get to learn about his relationships.

528
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:23,080
It's very easy to get caught that way.

529
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:25,150
However, this guy made an effort
to cut off the hands,

530
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,890
then put them on the bag for show.

531
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,720
This is like a warning.

532
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:30,320
A warning?

533
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,960
"Be careful with what you do
with your hands."

534
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:38,600
So is the suspect someone
the victim knows or not?

535
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:40,600
It might or might not be.

536

Gosh, what do you mean?

537

For example, it's like "Although I drank,
I wasn't drunk."

538

They know each other,
but they are not acquaintances.

539

Don't let that quack
do surgery on your face.

652
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,830
Just go home.

653
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:24,700
He couldn't even fix his own face,

654
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:26,970
so how can he fix yours?
Now, get out of here.

655
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,510
Go on. Go home.

656
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:29,840
Get out.

657
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:32,110
Oh, so you're a cop.

658
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:34,580
- But so what?
- My goodness, you're cute.

659
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:36,550
Are you trying to be cute right now?

660
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,780
Do you not feel like
getting arrested today?

661
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:40,150
Should I come back tomorrow?

662
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:45,560
My goodness,
I guess you guys were doing surgery.

663
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,430
My goodness.

664
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:51,930
What is this?
It's like an ant tunnel or something.

665
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:55,570
I don't know why you're here,
but why don't you just leave?

666
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,410
Okay. If you don't put up a fight,
I'll just quietly arrest you.

667
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:03,010
But if you run away, you'll earn
an extra punch for every ten seconds.

668
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:05,440
Do you have bad eyesight?

669
00:43:05,590 --> 00:43:08,110
Take a look around.
You're the one who should be running.

670
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:10,450
Do you guys know a guy called
Jeong Man-bok?

671
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:12,380
"Man-bok"? Who's that?

672
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:15,150
He has a nasty look,

673
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:18,660
and he has a tattoo of a sparrow
on his shoulder.

674
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:21,490
When he eats spicy food,
he sweats beneath his nose.

675
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:23,860
Oh, and asthma. He has asthma,
so he's always puffing...

676
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:27,300
He can knock out 6 teeth
with just 1 punch.

677
00:43:27,310 --> 00:43:29,270
Do you really not know him?

678
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:30,940
That's enough, Detective Jin.

679
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:33,770
Gosh, what took you so long?

680
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:36,080
I had a hard time explaining you
to these guys.

681
00:43:36,090 --> 00:43:37,840
We had to get ready for business first.

682
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:40,410
And I appreciate the detailed explanation.

683
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:43,350
But the tattoo on my shoulder
is an eagle, not a sparrow.

684
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:45,320
Really?

685
00:43:45,530 --> 00:43:47,190
What are you doing?
We need to do business.

686
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,150
Hurry up and get rid of them.

687
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:51,420
What's with you?
You should really use honorifics.

688
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,360
My gosh. Hey. What... Hey!

689
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:36,740
You little...

690
00:44:43,490 --> 00:44:45,610
I told you not to run!

691
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:50,320
Hey! Are you Bumblebee?

692
00:44:50,330 --> 00:44:51,550
What now?

693
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:55,090
My gosh, get off me!

694
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,320
What? What are you doing here?

695
00:44:59,470 --> 00:45:00,590
What the...

696
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:11,100
Hey!

697
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:18,410
Sang-baek, you punk!

698
00:45:23,890 --> 00:45:25,050
My gosh.

699
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:28,820
Why is he so fast?

700
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,760
Let me borrow this.

701
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:36,500
What's wrong with this?

702
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:43,840
Oh, gosh!

703
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:51,610
What was that?

704
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:53,480
Who are you?

705
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:57,120
- Are you also a cop?
- No, I'm not! Wait!

706
00:45:57,130 --> 00:45:58,520
No, wait!

707
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,730
3 minutes and 30 seconds.

708
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:11,030
I promised you a punch
for every ten seconds.

709
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:13,370
I think ten punches will do. Come here.

710
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:15,330
"Ten punches"?

711
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,600
What are you doing? You're a cop.

712
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:21,810
My goodness. Gosh.

713
00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:24,910
It should be 21 punches.

714
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:27,650
- Don't you know how to do math?
- What?

715
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:32,820
My gosh.

716
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:35,020
Goodness.

717
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,260
What are you doing?

718
00:46:37,430 --> 00:46:39,320
Are you trying to fake your tears?

719
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:41,530
My gosh, I have dry eyes.

720
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:44,360
I rarely cry over things.

721
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:49,330
- Know this student?
- Know this teacher?

722
00:46:52,210 --> 00:46:53,610
- "Student"?
- "Teacher"?

723
00:46:57,620 --> 00:47:01,010
Is your online nickname Bumblebee?

724
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:03,180
You posted the most comments on his blog
in memory of him.

725
00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:04,480
How do you know him?

726
00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:07,750
Gu Hyeong-jin left you
over 100 missed calls before he died.

727
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:10,090
But why didn't you answer?
How do you know him?

728
00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:12,060
Wait. In memory?

729
00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:13,830
Did someone die? What's this case about?

730
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:16,400
Are you saying he's a suspect,
not just a witness?

731
00:47:16,410 --> 00:47:18,130
What? A witness?

732
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:19,430
And who called him before he died?

733
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,730
What case are you investigating?

734
00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:23,270
"Gu Hyeong-jin"?
That name sounds so familiar.

735
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:26,270
I'm sorry, but can I start talking?

736
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:29,210
Let me see that photo.

737
00:47:29,450 --> 00:47:31,640
- Was his name Lee Jong-dae?
- I can't show you this.

738
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:33,450
You might just steal this from me again.

739
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:35,350
Gosh, what's with you?

740
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:38,650
I don't steal stuff. I'm a cop.

741
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:42,990
It looks like he's a crucial figure
regarding whatever you're investigating.

742
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:45,420
- But should I just set him free?
- You won't do that.

743
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:47,860
You're just going to put him in jail
for doing illegal surgery.

744
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,330
Okay, fine.

745
00:47:51,570 --> 00:47:55,070
Then let's take turns
asking him questions.

746
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:56,940
Fine. Let me go first.

747
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:01,070
I noticed that you wrote,
"I hope you're happy up there."

748
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:04,910
And that was before
the press announced his death.

749
00:48:04,990 --> 00:48:06,380
If you didn't kill him,

750
00:48:06,390 --> 00:48:08,650
how did you know that he died?

751
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:10,980
Oh, that?

752
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:15,790
The thing is, I was a member
of a gaming community.

753
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:18,760
And there was a guy who always
had a problem with every post I uploaded.

754
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:20,590
I'm guessing that was Lee Jong-dae.

755
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:23,560
Yes. But he was like that with everyone.

756
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:26,330
So a few of us agreed to call him out

757
00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:28,900
and teach him a lesson.

758
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,040
Is that why you killed him?

759
00:48:31,050 --> 00:48:32,240
No.

760
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:35,040
I don't know if I should tell you this.

761
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:38,840
The thing is, I got there a little early.

762
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:41,810
And that's when I saw a guy
hacking at Lee Jong-dae

763
00:48:42,290 --> 00:48:43,620
with an ax.

764
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:49,720
That means you're a witness.

765
00:48:49,730 --> 00:48:51,020
Why didn't you call the cops?

766
00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:52,930
I didn't want to get involved.

767
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:54,960
I was thankful I didn't call the cops

768
00:48:54,970 --> 00:48:56,760
when I saw an innocent guy get arrested.

769
00:48:56,770 --> 00:48:58,400
Are you serious?

770
00:48:58,570 --> 00:49:00,630
So did you see the culprit's face?

771
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:04,470
No, it happened pretty far away,
and it was really dark.

772
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:07,870
Then who were the other members?
Do you remember their user IDs?

773
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:09,110
There were two others.

774
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:11,810
They were "Dr. Caligari's Cabinet"
and "Blood Finger".

775
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:13,680
But I'm sure it wasn't them.

776
00:49:13,690 --> 00:49:14,750
How can you be so sure?

777
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:17,680
Think about it. We agreed to meet up
to teach him a lesson.

778
00:49:17,690 --> 00:49:19,850
But if that was the purpose,
they would've done it alone.

779
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:21,720
Why would they want a witness?

780
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:24,220
Then what about Gu Hyeong-jin?
How do you know him?

781
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:25,590
Oh, that teacher?

782
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:26,990
He's a real jerk.

783
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,360
He sold off his students.

784
00:49:28,370 --> 00:49:30,300
He was one of our main brokers.

785
00:49:30,310 --> 00:49:31,830
He brought kids who ran away from home.

786
00:49:31,970 --> 00:49:34,230
He even begged me for surgery

787
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:38,500
the day he died, but I rejected him
because I didn't want to get caught.

788
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:42,870
But look. I got caught and beaten up.

789
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:45,580
You got beaten up? By whom?

790
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:46,950
What?

791
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,280
By me.

792
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,620
She stepped on me. It hurts.

793
00:49:51,630 --> 00:49:53,650
You shouldn't have crossed her
in the first place.

794
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:55,050
This is wrong.

795
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:58,120
A cop shouldn't torture
an innocent civilian.

796
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:00,560
Gosh, I'm a civilian, too.

797
00:50:02,270 --> 00:50:04,660
- Look! She did it again!
- I'm leaving now.

798
00:50:05,410 --> 00:50:06,670
Yes, that's right.

799
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:09,430
You were beaten up by a horrible civilian.

800
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:10,500
Let's go.

801
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:12,270
- Get up.
- What? Go where?

802
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:13,740

What? Who won the point?

974
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:13,790
- That jerk?
- Why do you think he said he owes you one?

975
01:00:13,970 --> 01:00:15,820
Gosh, well, that's...

976
01:00:18,270 --> 01:00:20,700
- Right.
- The document envelope.

977
01:00:22,470 --> 01:00:24,230
Let me give you a heads-up
since I owe you one.

978
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:27,400
If you picked this case for your TV show,
you should hurry.

979
01:00:27,410 --> 01:00:29,100
I think I'll beat you to it again.

980
01:00:29,850 --> 01:00:32,210
The envelope had
a fingerprint analysis from the NFS.

981
01:00:32,350 --> 01:00:34,610
What if Detective Jin found
a definite piece of evidence?

982
01:00:34,890 --> 01:00:37,850
For example, he might have found
an unidentified fingerprint

983
01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:39,710
on the murder weapon at the crime scene.

984
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:42,450
And these two fingerprints matched?

985
01:00:43,330 --> 01:00:44,990
Is that why he owes me one?

986
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:49,460
It's certain that these two victims
were murdered by the same culprit.

987
01:00:50,870 --> 01:00:53,730
Then, we must catch the culprit
before that cop does.

988
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:56,630
I can't lose out to that lousy cop again.

989
01:00:57,480 --> 01:01:01,270
Just tell me.
Why did Gu Hyeong-jin call you

990
01:01:01,380 --> 01:01:03,140
over 100 times before he died?

991
01:01:03,820 --> 01:01:08,010
My goodness. If I have a warm bowl
of hearty rib soup,

992
01:01:08,190 --> 01:01:09,640
it might job my memory.

993
01:01:11,220 --> 01:01:13,650
Oh, right. Bring me the tools.

994
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:19,490
Wait. We're living in the 21st century,
and there are security cameras here.

995
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:21,620
You're not going to beat me up, right?

996
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:30,570
Most of his clients were minors
who ran away from home.

997
01:01:30,580 --> 01:01:32,370
And he operated on them without a license.

998
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:35,640
Should we start with abduction
and confinement of minors?

999
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:37,000
Okay.

1000
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:39,440
He performed surgeries without a license.

1001
01:01:39,650 --> 01:01:42,540
He abducted and locked up minors.
Right here.

1002

Hold on. What are you guys doing?

1003
01:01:44,690 --> 01:01:46,680
Five years for practicing
medicine without a license.

1004
01:01:46,690 --> 01:01:49,520
And add 15 years for abducting
and locking up minors.

1005

1006

- He should be in prison when he turns 70.
- You bet.

1007
01:01:54,170 --> 01:01:55,920
Abduction, illegal trade,

1008
01:01:55,930 --> 01:01:57,960
- larceny, manslaughter,
- That's...

- The last one is serious.

- He won't be able to get out then.

That teacher went around to look
for his students who ran away from home.

1016

And one of the students
got surgery from me.

1017
01:02:19,690 --> 01:02:22,220
He somehow managed to get my number.

1018

01:08:55,050 --> 01:08:57,380
you should have brought hard evidence!

1127
01:08:58,660 --> 01:09:01,120
That means Kim Min-seok
isn't the real culprit.

1128
01:09:01,290 --> 01:09:03,420
[ You will face how awful
the Korean legal system is ]

1129
01:09:03,420 --> 01:09:05,050
in the upcoming days.

1130
01:09:05,220 --> 01:09:06,850
[ He thinks he's above the law? ]

1131
01:09:06,860 --> 01:09:08,420
[ I'll show him that there's a crazy guy ]

1132
01:09:08,590 --> 01:09:10,260
who's above him.
