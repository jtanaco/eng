00:00:06,659 --> 00:00:08,059
(Episode 13)

2
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:13,740
You did well today.

3
00:00:14,269 --> 00:00:16,939
You did very well yourself.

4
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:19,839
Oh, wait. Just a moment.

5
00:00:28,849 --> 00:00:31,720
I bought this a while ago and wasn't able to give it to you.

6
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:33,189
Here.

7
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:38,090
Throw it away if you don't like it.

8
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,359
Put it on for me.

9
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:01,219
Go on home.

10
00:01:19,069 --> 00:01:20,339
Thank you.

11
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:24,369
I...

12
00:01:25,839 --> 00:01:27,640
Hey...

13
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,619
Thanks for the gift.

14
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,720
It's not exactly a gift.

15
00:01:38,619 --> 00:01:40,619
How should I put it?

16
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:43,229
It's kind of like a Band-aid.

17
00:01:43,789 --> 00:01:45,630
But don't think too much of it.

18
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:49,330
I kept noticing your scar, so I thought I'd give it to you.

19
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:50,970
Thank you so much for the Band-aid.

20
00:01:54,069 --> 00:01:55,069
Right.

21
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,849
Gosh.

22
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,260
Why is he running?

23
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,230
He must be really embarrassed.

24
00:02:35,749 --> 00:02:37,779
Maybe it's because I confessed everything like a loser.

25
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,980
But I feel so much better now.

26
00:02:41,649 --> 00:02:43,089
Not me.

27
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,920
I never got to confess my biggest secret...

28
00:02:49,059 --> 00:02:50,429
and become a sad loser.

29
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,100
What's that?

30
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,200
I never got to confess my feelings...

31
00:02:58,629 --> 00:03:00,770
to the person I like.

32
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:05,110
So let me give you a word of advice.

33
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:09,110
Just confess how you feel if you don't want to be a loser.

34
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,119
I've become a good friend now, but that's not the case for you.

35
00:03:13,779 --> 00:03:15,050
It's not too late.

36
00:03:41,409 --> 00:03:42,749
Were you working out?

37
00:03:43,779 --> 00:03:45,309
What's gotten into you? You rarely work out.

38
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:47,179
I love to exercise.

39
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:50,790
If I think about it, you really don't know much about me.

40
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:57,260
I heard Woo Joo started doing stage therapy again.

41
00:03:57,459 --> 00:03:58,689
Good choice.

42
00:03:58,689 --> 00:04:00,800
I didn't exactly do it for her.

43
00:04:01,059 --> 00:04:02,869
I was the one who needed her help.

44
00:04:02,869 --> 00:04:06,170
She's really good at making patients talk about their feelings.

45
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:08,339
You don't need to draw a line.

46
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:11,070
You guys would've ended up meeting each other again...

47
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:12,909
even if it weren't for stage therapy.

48
00:04:13,679 --> 00:04:16,649
It just happened a lot faster than expected.

49
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:18,379
I think Woo Joo is...

50
00:04:19,749 --> 00:04:22,319
experiencing transference with me.

51
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:24,290
(When a patient redirects their feelings for someone important)

52
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:26,720
It seems to have a very positive effect on her.

53
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,030
She must've relied on you a lot.

54
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:32,860
Do you think I should keep a distance?

55
00:04:33,629 --> 00:04:35,759
Just treat her like you normally do.

56
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,530
Or you can start treating her right away.

57
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:42,069
Then she'll find out that her feelings aren't real.

58
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,610
Can you help me out a little?

59
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:47,939
I've encountered tons of borderline patients,

60
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:50,079
but why do you think I chose to introduce you to Woo Joo?

61
00:04:51,579 --> 00:04:53,650
She's different from Se Yeon.

62
00:04:54,949 --> 00:04:58,720
Don't avoid her or draw a line. Face her, for your own sake.

63
00:04:59,189 --> 00:05:02,730
Wow, Young Won. You truly are my doctor.

64
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:07,400
I don't want to be your doctor.

65
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,929
A good friend is a good psychiatrist.

66
00:05:09,929 --> 00:05:11,600
You listen and take my side.

67
00:05:12,869 --> 00:05:14,240
I don't want to be a friend.

68
00:05:17,369 --> 00:05:18,410
Then what?

69
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:21,210
Never mind.

70
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,660
It's just transference.

71
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:37,660
It's not real affection. It's transference.

72
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:12,790
I dreamt of the fire again.

73
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:21,230
Can you swap night duty with me?

74
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:23,100
- I can't. - Please, just once.

75
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,699
We swapped twice already.

76
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:27,040
Dr. Lee didn't come with you?

77
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,410
I doubt he has time to eat today. He's really busy.

78
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:34,540
- He can't even eat? - He can't.

79
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:42,179
- Enjoy your meal. - Thanks. I will.

80
00:07:42,179 --> 00:07:44,220
- You too. - Thank you.

81
00:07:51,829 --> 00:07:53,600
Will you stop it?

82
00:07:54,429 --> 00:07:56,129
Dr. Noh, you like fried eggs, right?

83
00:07:56,929 --> 00:07:58,730
Yes. How did you know that?

84
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:00,040
- Here. - Thank you.

85
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,999
Ji Sun, what should I stop doing?

86
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:04,139
I was talking to Woo Joo. You can eat.

87
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,639
Your doctors are really clueless.

88
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:11,179
Get up.

89
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:15,920
Are you that pleased?

90
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:19,189
Do you know what this bracelet is called?

91
00:08:19,819 --> 00:08:22,259
My gosh. You named it already?

92
00:08:23,889 --> 00:08:25,129
"Band-aid."

93
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:27,929
Darn you.

94
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,970
Get in there.

95
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,820
This is Assemblyman Ko Sang Moo. Say hello.

96
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,060
Hello. I'm Lee Si Joon.

97
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:54,490
Hello.

98
00:08:55,259 --> 00:08:56,389
I'm Ko Sang Moo.

99
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:03,869
You must've seen many people like me,

100
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:06,070
so you're not surprised, are you?

101
00:09:07,369 --> 00:09:08,700
When did the symptoms begin?

102
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:09,970
Last night.

103
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:12,740
It's the first time since his first outbreak when he was nine.

104
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:15,279
There had been signs of a few possible outbreaks.

105
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:18,110
When I was a lawyer before I joined the National Assembly.

106
00:09:20,749 --> 00:09:22,889
Those signs disappeared shortly.

107
00:09:23,549 --> 00:09:27,060
I believe you're stressed out over the upcoming hearing.

108
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,889
Can I be healed before the hearing?

109
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:34,600
- Not completely. - Dr. Lee.

110
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,369
I can reduce the symptoms with medication.

111
00:09:42,299 --> 00:09:44,610
To see that this happened before the hearing,

112
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:48,610
I'm guessing the deities want me to realize my place.

113
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:50,710
Why would you say that?

114
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:55,080
You fought for laborers' rights your whole life.

115
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,389
You can't give up over something like this.

116
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,460
We will do our best...

117
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:02,560
and ensure you can attend the hearing.

118
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:11,129
Can you explain the situation right before the tics began?

119
00:10:13,169 --> 00:10:14,399
Let's see...

120
00:10:15,299 --> 00:10:17,169
You all did very well.

121
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:19,639
Thanks to you, the bill was passed.

122
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:23,749
Now let's work even harder on the upcoming project and bill.

123
00:10:23,749 --> 00:10:25,580
- Yes, sir. - You all did so well.

124
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,230
Sir. Are you all right?

125
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:41,899
Mr. Ko Sang Moo.

126
00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:43,700
He has a chronic motor tic disorder.

127
00:10:44,029 --> 00:10:45,769
The first outbreak was when he was nine.

128
00:10:46,269 --> 00:10:48,369
It occurred a few times in adulthood,

129
00:10:48,369 --> 00:10:50,039
but the symptoms didn't last.

130
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:51,539
They stopped soon enough.

131
00:10:51,539 --> 00:10:53,909
By Ko Sang Moo, do you mean...

132
00:10:53,909 --> 00:10:56,879
Yes. The candidate for the Minister of Employment and Labor.

133
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:58,610
His hearing is coming up.

134
00:10:58,749 --> 00:11:01,220
Then we must cure him before then.

135
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,919
That's not far off.

136
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:04,249
How should we treat him?

137
00:11:04,249 --> 00:11:06,659
Of all neurotransmitters, tics are...

138
00:11:06,659 --> 00:11:09,019
strongly connected to the dopamine system.

139
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:11,389
We should treat him with appropriate medication...

140
00:11:11,389 --> 00:11:13,399
and carry out habit reversal training.

141
00:11:13,529 --> 00:11:15,430
Although it's not common practice,

142
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:17,769
we could also carry out biofeedback therapy.

143
00:11:17,899 --> 00:11:19,100
Prior to the hearing,

144
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,299
he must've been under great pressure.

145
00:11:21,299 --> 00:11:24,310
We should quickly identify the cause with psychotherapy.

146
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:25,470
There's not much time.

147
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:28,080
I think we should do everything simultaneously.

148
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,110
I agree.

149
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:30,710
Woo Jung and Ji Hee,

150
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:32,749
focus on the patient's cranial nerve.

151
00:11:32,749 --> 00:11:34,049
Noo Ri and Se Chan.

152
00:11:34,049 --> 00:11:35,519
Carry out research for his psychotherapy.

153
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:36,519
Yes, doctor.

154
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:38,690
I can't work with Se Chan.

155
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:43,690
Do you enjoy scanning me?

156
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:44,990
What?

157
00:11:46,129 --> 00:11:48,799
You've been eyeballing me up and down.

158
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:50,070
Did you think I wouldn't notice?

159
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:52,169
You're mistaken.

160
00:11:54,499 --> 00:11:55,539
It's disgusting.

161
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:58,509
Noo Ri.

162
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:03,180
What is wrong with her?

163
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:06,009
- Dr. In, check on her. - Sure thing.

164
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,970
What were you doing? Why did you take my photos?

165
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:31,310
I didn't.

166
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:33,440
Don't lie. I saw you.

167
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,110
Stop it. I didn't take photos of you.

168
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:37,310
Give me a break.

169
00:12:37,649 --> 00:12:39,409
What is it, Noo Ri? What's the matter?

170
00:12:39,619 --> 00:12:41,850
He took photos of me with his phone.

171
00:12:42,379 --> 00:12:44,019
I saw you do it.

172
00:12:44,019 --> 00:12:45,350
I didn't take any photos.

173
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:47,889
Take a look. I didn't photograph anything.

174
00:12:51,259 --> 00:12:52,830
You must've hidden them!

175
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,759
You hid the photos so others can't find them!

176
00:12:56,529 --> 00:12:58,799
What are you talking about?

177
00:13:05,169 --> 00:13:07,509
I think I'm losing my mind.

178
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:12,879
I think the whole world saw my photo.

179
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:16,320
I think everyone's looking at me.

180
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,659
I keep looking for photos of me online in case they're there.

181
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,889
I keep regretting...

182
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,700
taking the subway and ending up getting my photo taken.

183
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:33,269
I should've splurged and taken a taxi.

184
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,409
Noo Ri, it wasn't your fault that your photo was taken.

185
00:13:36,409 --> 00:13:40,180
It was just something like an accident.

186
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:44,680
I want revenge.

187
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:47,850
I want to hurt the man who took my photo.

188
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:49,720
He's paying the price.

189
00:13:50,049 --> 00:13:52,749
He got criminal punishment for running around the park naked,

190
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:55,019
and he can't practice medicine anymore.

191
00:13:58,389 --> 00:14:01,230
How about you take a few days off work?

192
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,680
I won't snap my neck doing this, will I?

193
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,090
My gosh. You don't have to worry.

194
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:25,350
It's your muscles that are twitching.

195
00:14:26,619 --> 00:14:30,889
First of all, we'll begin by naming your tic.

196
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:32,529
We'll name it?

197
00:14:32,529 --> 00:14:34,330
To become attached to it.

198
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,399
That's interesting.

199
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:39,129
What will you name it?

200
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:43,470
I think it's best we go with a term you're familiar with.

201
00:14:45,769 --> 00:14:49,110
How about we call your tic "My fellow citizens"?

202
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,509
It's a phrase you people say a lot.

203
00:14:52,009 --> 00:14:53,220
"My fellow citizens"?

204
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:56,889
Very well.

205
00:14:57,419 --> 00:15:00,560
From now on, we'll call your tic symptom...

206
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,659
"My fellow citizens".

207
00:15:03,129 --> 00:15:04,860
But before that symptom occurs,

208
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,999
I'm sure you experience something in advance.

209
00:15:06,999 --> 00:15:10,600
For example, your neck might feel a bit heavy...

210
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,369
or a little stiff.

211
00:15:13,169 --> 00:15:15,169
Right before my neck is about to move,

212
00:15:15,169 --> 00:15:19,269
it tickles a little or sometimes feels a bit stiff.

213
00:15:19,269 --> 00:15:21,680
I feel like I have to move it.

214
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,180
Then every time your symptom occurs,

215
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:27,850
try your best to move the opposite side of your neck...

216
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:30,190
although I know it's going to be hard.

217
00:15:30,289 --> 00:15:31,490
But here's what's important.

218
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:35,789
Every time your symptom occurs, you must shout out its name.

219
00:15:35,789 --> 00:15:38,230
"My fellow citizens!"

220
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:39,899
Just like this.

221
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,369
You're not joking, are you?

222
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,970
This is called HRT...

223
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:49,169
which is short for habit reversal training.

224
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:52,570
It's a very popular way to treat tic disorders.

225
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:55,409
By trying to move a muscle that is irrelevant to your tic,

226
00:15:55,409 --> 00:15:58,210
it creates a competitive reaction and helps you stop your tic.

227
00:15:59,749 --> 00:16:02,180
Let me show you one more time.

228
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:05,190
Okay. Right when you feel like your symptom is about to occur...

229
00:16:05,289 --> 00:16:07,560
"My fellow citizens!"

230
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,019
Then you push your chin this way.

231
00:16:10,889 --> 00:16:13,360
Okay, it's your turn now.

232
00:16:17,169 --> 00:16:18,700
"My fellow citizens."

233
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:22,570
You need to be more confident. Say it out loud.

234
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:23,669
Let's try that one more time.

235
00:16:26,369 --> 00:16:29,180
"My fellow citizens!"

236
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:32,110
That's exactly it! Great job!

237
00:16:34,149 --> 00:16:35,149
Let's try one more time.

238
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:41,659
"My fellow citizens!"

239
00:16:41,789 --> 00:16:43,330
The last one was better.

240
00:16:43,389 --> 00:16:45,490
The key point to habit reverse training...

241
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:48,399
is to be aware of the signs that lead to the symptoms.

242
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:50,129
"My fellow citizens!"

243
00:16:50,129 --> 00:16:52,499
In other words, it means the patient...

244
00:16:52,499 --> 00:16:55,070
needs to become sensitive to their symptoms.

245
00:16:56,269 --> 00:16:57,570
Let's try one last time.

246
00:16:57,669 --> 00:17:00,279
When a patient has a tic disorder, you must distinguish them...

247
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:02,539
from patients who have Huntington's disease.

248
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,779
But Mr. Ko Sang Moo's neurological examination...

249
00:17:05,779 --> 00:17:08,419
and brainwave tests all came out normal.

250
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:12,249
That means it got worse due to stress.

251
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:15,819
It was probably due to a psychological reason.

252
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:20,730
I wonder what it was that caused his tic disorder to reoccur.

253
00:17:29,269 --> 00:17:31,210
(Han Woo Joo)

254
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:49,019
- The receiver cannot be reached. - Why isn't he picking up?

255
00:17:49,019 --> 00:17:52,130
He was too busy to even eat lunch. He's probably too busy to pick up.

256
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:54,259
The only time I get to see Ji Hee is when she comes here for lunch.

257
00:17:54,259 --> 00:17:55,460
It's normally hard to meet her.

258
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,170
Then I should go.

259
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:01,200
- Go where? - Today's my mom's birthday.

260
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:02,599
What mom?

261
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,670
Your adoptive mother who runs a chicken restaurant?

262
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:06,170
You still care about them?

263
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:07,910
When did I ever care so much?

264
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:10,680
Those people sent you back to the orphanage.

265
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,279
And not only that, but your adoptive father...

266
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:14,779
even took money from you.

267
00:18:14,779 --> 00:18:15,849
Don't badmouth them.

268
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,319
They raised me for six years.

269
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:21,359
My adoptive father was the only person who gave me flowers...

270
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:22,789
when I graduated elementary school.

271
00:18:23,589 --> 00:18:26,160
I should visit them often if I want them to forgive me.

272
00:18:30,499 --> 00:18:32,329
I dreamt of the fire again.

273
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:34,900
That's because you still think of it.

274
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:37,839
What should I get for my mom's birthday?

275
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:40,880
Your mom's birthday?

276
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,380
You know what?

277
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:45,980
I'll give you a bag of trash. Why don't you give her that?

278
00:18:46,849 --> 00:18:48,650
You're so mean.

279
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:52,789
You're an idiot.

280
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:58,230
(Luxury Chicken, Craft Beer)

281
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:00,099
They urgently put the place up for rent...

282
00:19:00,099 --> 00:19:01,930
even though their contract period wasn't over yet.

283
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:03,700
It's been less than three weeks since I took over.

284
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,999
Do you really not know where they went?

285
00:19:05,999 --> 00:19:07,700
How many times do I need to tell you?

286
00:19:07,769 --> 00:19:10,210
I never even got to meet them.

287
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:20,079
The receiver cannot be reached. You will be directed to voicemail...

288
00:19:33,259 --> 00:19:35,829
- The receiver cannot be reached. - Darn it!

289
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,339
The receiver cannot be reached. You will be directed to voicemail...

290
00:19:45,569 --> 00:19:48,180
The receiver cannot be reached. You will be directed to voicemail...

291
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,019
What do you want?

292
00:20:01,019 --> 00:20:02,460
Mom!

293
00:20:03,789 --> 00:20:06,390
Mom, why did you move your business without even telling me?

294
00:20:06,999 --> 00:20:08,529
Did something happen?

295
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,299
It's your birthday today.

296
00:20:12,499 --> 00:20:14,940
I'll leave as soon as I give you your gift.

297
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:20,079
You can't do this to me!

298
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:21,940
This was the only place I could come to see you!

299
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:24,549
You can't just leave without telling me!

300
00:20:28,779 --> 00:20:30,720
Do you think I won't be able to find you?

301
00:20:30,749 --> 00:20:32,549
I'm going to find you no matter what!

302
00:20:32,789 --> 00:20:35,190
Mo... Mom.

303
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,089
Mom!

304
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,259
One.

305
00:20:47,569 --> 00:20:48,700
Two.

306
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,700
Three.

307
00:20:50,269 --> 00:20:52,170
Four.

308
00:20:54,579 --> 00:20:55,779
Five.

309
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:14,299
His chief of staff told me that he rarely got much sleep...

310
00:21:14,299 --> 00:21:16,099
because he was busy getting ready for the hearing.

311
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,200
On top of that, he's been helping laborers get reinstated...

312
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,499
and organized a support project for laborers.

313
00:21:19,499 --> 00:21:21,839
He was also getting ready for an open forum for platform laborers.

314
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:26,609
And I heard Assemblyman Ko usually uses the subway.

315
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:28,809
- "The subway"? - Yes.

316
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:30,279
He once formed an organization to help improve...

317
00:21:30,279 --> 00:21:31,680
the working conditions for subway conductors in Seoul.

318
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,180
And he even said assembly members still earn three times more...

319
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,749
than the average laborer in Korea even if their wage...

320
00:21:35,779 --> 00:21:36,849
gets deducted by 50 percent.

321
00:21:36,849 --> 00:21:39,289
So he gave out gifts to those who clean the National Assembly.

322
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:42,490
You must be a big fan of Assemblyman Ko.

323
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:45,059
Sir.

324
00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:46,529
I think a man like him deserves to become...

325
00:21:46,529 --> 00:21:48,900
the Minister of Employment and Labor.

326
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:51,599
I want to help him overcome his tic so he can attend the hearing.

327
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:55,069
He's receiving habit reversal training.

328
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,140
Make him do it 50 times a session.

329
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,509
Okay, I will.

330
00:22:02,309 --> 00:22:03,749
(Han Woo Joo)

331
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:13,890
I guess you were really busy.

332
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:16,120
I called you a lot of times earlier.

333
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:18,329
Yes, I was busy today.

334
00:22:18,329 --> 00:22:21,029
I guess this is why you don't have a girlfriend.

335
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,670
Why did you call me?

336
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,569
Dr. Lee.

337
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:28,370
Look up at the sky.

338
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,970
There's a full moon.

339
00:22:32,269 --> 00:22:34,180
We might be apart.

340
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:36,210
But we're able to see the same moon.

341
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:39,150
I'm sorry, but I don't have time to look at the moon.

342
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:41,079
Can I meet you at the hospital?

343
00:22:41,079 --> 00:22:43,079
Why? Is there something wrong?

344
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:46,150
Do I need a reason to meet you?

345
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:51,829
There's a chicken restaurant I used to enjoy going to,

346
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:54,130
but the owner suddenly changed.

347
00:22:56,059 --> 00:22:58,230
The owner moved without even telling me.

348
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:01,470
How could this happen?

349
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:04,069
Are you crying?

350
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:06,509
I'm just so upset.

351
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,740
It's so upsetting.

352
00:23:12,779 --> 00:23:15,019
You're crying because the chicken restaurant is gone?

353
00:23:15,049 --> 00:23:18,990
It wasn't an ordinary chicken restaurant!

354
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:21,859
There are tons of chicken restaurants in Seoul.

355
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:23,220
I'm sure you'll find another place that suits your palate.

356
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:26,160
No, there's no other place like this one!

357
00:23:31,069 --> 00:23:34,069
Let me tell you about this place in person.

358
00:23:34,069 --> 00:23:36,269
- I'll go see you. - I don't have time for that.

359
00:23:36,269 --> 00:23:37,370
I don't even like chicken.

360
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:39,569
Do you think I'm being like this because of chicken?

361
00:23:39,569 --> 00:23:41,309
Then what's the issue?

362
00:23:41,309 --> 00:23:42,380
Forget it.

363
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:44,609
I don't need your help.

364
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:02,759
What's her problem? She's being so ridiculous.

365
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:06,200
Is it not about chicken?

366
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:11,640
Where are you?

367
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,240
I guess you were waiting for someone to call.

368
00:24:13,309 --> 00:24:15,410
Oh, Young Won, it's you.

369
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,849
What brings you all the way to the hospital?

370
00:24:24,019 --> 00:24:26,190
I wanted to have coffee with you.

371
00:24:26,289 --> 00:24:28,990
Thanks. This will have to do for dinner.

372
00:24:29,019 --> 00:24:31,059
- You didn't eat dinner? - No.

373
00:24:35,029 --> 00:24:36,200
You must have something to say to me.

374
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,930
You're good.

375
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:39,029
Is it because of Woo Joo?

376
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:41,700
What's wrong? Did something happen again?

377
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,109
I'm the problem.

378
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:47,509
I can't seem to be natural with her because of the transference.

379
00:24:47,779 --> 00:24:50,680
I keep avoiding her calls, and every time she calls,

380
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,609
I find myself being cold to her.

381
00:24:53,779 --> 00:24:55,720
I think I'm being more sensitive about it.

382
00:24:57,089 --> 00:24:59,089
You also become a patient when you're with a borderline patient.

383
00:24:59,089 --> 00:25:00,150
It's PTSD.

384
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:02,660
(PTSD: Post traumatic stress disorder)

385
00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:05,430
Take your time. No one's rushing you.

386
00:25:08,599 --> 00:25:09,759
What are you here to talk to me about?

387
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:16,999
To be honest,

388
00:25:18,039 --> 00:25:19,740
eight years ago, I actually knew...

389
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:23,480
that Jeong Se Yeon might die.

390
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:27,420
I knew that, but I never told you anything.

391
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:31,819
The reason I'm telling you this...

392
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:35,319
isn't because I want to apologize and be forgiven.

393
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,559
It's because I want to tell you why didn't say anything back then.

394
00:25:45,569 --> 00:25:46,630
Why are you laughing?

395
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,710
Gosh, you fool.

396
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,549
You must've been pretty hard on yourself because of that.

397
00:25:58,609 --> 00:26:00,380
If you had told me,

398
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:03,650
do you think I would've been able...

399
00:26:05,019 --> 00:26:06,249
to stop her from dying?

400
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:09,259
No.

401
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:12,890
She would've done everything she could...

402
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:16,700
to die in front of me.

403
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:20,329
After all, her goal was to torture me.

404
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,640
Don't you want to know why I didn't tell you?

405
00:26:24,809 --> 00:26:26,740
No, I don't want to know.

406
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,680
Gosh, I'm starving. Let's go grab something to eat.

407
00:26:43,789 --> 00:26:45,990
Why isn't she back yet? I can't even reach her.

408
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:49,059
She's not my friend. She's like a little baby.

409
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:50,700
She's like a seven-year-old girl.

410
00:26:53,569 --> 00:26:55,670
Dr. Lee, are you here to eat?

411
00:26:55,799 --> 00:26:58,109
- Do you have any food left? - Yes, have a seat.

412
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:00,210
Hello.

413
00:27:00,339 --> 00:27:03,109
I've heard a lot about you from Woo Joo.

414
00:27:03,109 --> 00:27:04,579
I'm Ji Young Won.

415
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,009
Hello.

416
00:27:07,749 --> 00:27:08,880
Thank you.

417
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:10,319
- By the way, - Yes?

418
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:13,349
did Woo Joo have a bad day today?

419
00:27:13,349 --> 00:27:14,660
No, not really.

420
00:27:15,289 --> 00:27:18,460
She spent all day bragging about the bracelet you gave her.

421
00:27:18,789 --> 00:27:20,089
That's nothing to brag about.

422
00:27:21,099 --> 00:27:24,029
Dr. Lee, did she call you today?

423
00:27:24,029 --> 00:27:25,200
Yes, she called earlier.

424
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,200
She was angry because the owner of a chicken restaurant...

425
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,539
- had changed. - What?

426
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:31,609
She must really like chicken.

427
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:35,339
Yes. Enjoy.

428
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:43,890
You gave Woo Joo a bracelet?

429
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:47,690
It wasn't exactly a gift. It was more like a Band-aid.

430
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:49,259
She has a scar on her wrist.

431
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:52,230
Young Won.

432
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:56,799
Make sure you never tell Woo Joo that you introduced her to me.

433
00:27:57,299 --> 00:27:59,700
She'll think you abandoned her.

434
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,099
Don't worry.

435
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,769
I'm a doctor, too.

436
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:05,240
Eat up.

437
00:28:21,859 --> 00:28:25,259
The bus will be arriving soon.

438
00:28:27,829 --> 00:28:31,099
(We can help you get your money back!)

439
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:34,099
(We can help you get your money back!)

440
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:53,120
Hello, are you even able to find people?

441
00:28:58,759 --> 00:29:00,799
You gave Woo Joo a bracelet?

442
00:29:00,999 --> 00:29:04,900
It wasn't exactly a gift. It was more like a Band-aid.

443
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,470
She has a scar on her wrist.

444
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:46,069
Who's here at this hour?

445
00:29:51,309 --> 00:29:52,579
What are you doing?

446
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:55,920
Didn't the doctor tell you about the precautions?

447
00:29:56,579 --> 00:29:57,849
Do you think you're totally fine...

448
00:29:57,849 --> 00:29:59,819
just because your tic symptoms have subdued a little?

449
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:03,720
I just wanted a nice, cold beer.

450
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:06,829
I won't drink it.

451
00:30:08,059 --> 00:30:09,400
What are you doing? Get out.

452
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:11,799
What? I... Well...

453
00:30:13,499 --> 00:30:14,569
You should go.

454
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,249
I had so much respect for you,

455
00:30:26,249 --> 00:30:27,779
but I'm really disappointed.

456
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:29,920
This is so wrong.

457
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:31,789
How in the world...

458
00:30:33,549 --> 00:30:35,589
could you think of drinking this alone?

459
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:48,870
This is better than your medicine, isn't it?

460
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:53,910
You're an interesting doctor.

461
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:56,009
- You're pretty interesting, too. - Me?

462
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,450
I heard you go to work by subway.

463
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:00,680
Why do you do that when you're a busy man?

464
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,249
I just do.

465
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:08,490
Sir.

466
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:10,759
It's hard, isn't it?

467
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:15,660
But you can't ever tell anyone how hard things are for you.

468
00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:17,400
You always need to be careful...

469
00:31:17,499 --> 00:31:19,769
of what you say and how you act when you're around others.

470
00:31:20,069 --> 00:31:22,339
And you can't easily get angry at anyone either.

471
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:26,569
And it's not like you're free to enjoy a nice drink.

472
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:30,009
I bet it feels more comfortable to be here.

473
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:34,349
How do you know so well?

474
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:37,249
People tell me that I'm like a mind-reader.

475
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,190
I'm sure everyone struggles in life.

476
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:47,799
- But it's hard. - What gives you the hardest time?

477
00:31:48,529 --> 00:31:50,230
The fact that I keep...

478
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:54,799
turning into a liar.

479
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:04,140

00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,411
(Eun Kang Medical Center)

481
00:32:11,851 --> 00:32:15,291
The receiver cannot be reached. You will be directed to...

482
00:32:16,791 --> 00:32:17,950
Is she upset?

483
00:32:20,421 --> 00:32:21,531
Woo Joo.

484
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:25,061
You know you have stage therapy today, right?

485
00:32:27,401 --> 00:32:29,430
What happened to the chicken yesterday?

486
00:32:32,601 --> 00:32:34,041
(What happened to the chicken yesterday?)

487
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,710
My fellow citizens!

488
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:45,121
Assemblyman Ko, you have a great sense of humor.

489
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:48,020
You even named your symptom?

490
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,651
It was Dr. Lee's idea.

491
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,361
I love you!

492
00:32:57,831 --> 00:32:59,931
That was my idea.

493
00:33:02,331 --> 00:33:05,941
It'll be hard, but hang in there for a while.

494
00:33:05,941 --> 00:33:09,611
Our staff are working their hardest to help you.

495
00:33:09,611 --> 00:33:10,841
Sure.

00:33:11,311 --> 00:33:15,551
Mr. Deputy Director. He can attend the hearing, right?

497
00:33:15,551 --> 00:33:17,150
Of course he can.

498
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:19,721
Even our director's on your side.

499
00:33:19,721 --> 00:33:21,691
You will make a full recovery.

500
00:33:21,691 --> 00:33:24,020
That's just embarrassing.

501
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:28,891
- I'm a fan. - I'm honored.

502
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:33,600
Since you said you're my fan,

503
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,671
could I ask for a favor?

504
00:33:36,671 --> 00:33:38,941
Yes. What can I do for you?

505
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:43,770
The director wants us to treat...

506
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:46,941
subway drivers who have panic disorders.

507
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:48,710
Why so suddenly?

508
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:51,210
Assemblyman Ko personally asked our director this favor.

509
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:52,520
- Personally? - Yes.

510
00:33:53,051 --> 00:33:54,751
The panic disorder of subway drivers...

511
00:33:54,751 --> 00:33:56,990
is probably about seven times worse than normal patients.

512
00:33:58,290 --> 00:34:00,721
I'd like Dr. In to head this.

513
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:03,290
- Can you do it? - Of course.

514
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:06,231
Assemblyman Ko seems to have a lot of interest...

515
00:34:06,231 --> 00:34:07,831
in the welfare of the subway drivers.

516
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:10,831
There's probably a personal reason we don't know about.

517
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,440
By the way, Dr. Lee,

518
00:34:13,571 --> 00:34:17,671
the director emphasized that we must make sure Assemblyman Ko...

519
00:34:17,671 --> 00:34:20,011
is discharged from this hospital feeling completely treated.

520
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,750
Our hospital's reputation is at stake, so give it your best.

521
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:25,620
No need to remind me. I'm trying my hardest to fix him.

522
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:27,421
There won't be a problem with him attending the hearing.

523
00:34:27,421 --> 00:34:29,821
We can alleviate his condition with medication.

524
00:34:30,051 --> 00:34:31,891
I'm continuing with the HRT session...

525
00:34:31,891 --> 00:34:33,690
and today, I'm thinking of using stage therapy...

526
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:35,490
to find out the cause of his stress.

527
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:36,530
Okay.

528
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:41,201
Make sure you prepare plenty of material regarding panic disorder.

529
00:34:41,201 --> 00:34:42,201
Yes, sir.

530
00:34:42,201 --> 00:34:44,840
And check his counseling schedule...

531
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,500
- and confirm it. - Yes, sir.

532
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,900
All right, let's get to work.

533
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:08,391
(Ankang Supermarket)

534
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:12,560
Mom.

535
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:15,071
You're really creeping me out.

536
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:17,270
How did you find me?

537
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,770
I want to give you this.

538
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,770
Did you eat seaweed soup yesterday?

539
00:35:23,641 --> 00:35:26,340
Yes. Since you came to give me this, I'll take it gratefully.

540
00:35:29,581 --> 00:35:32,650
Mom, why did you close the chicken restaurant?

541
00:35:33,821 --> 00:35:35,421
If you're done here, go.

542
00:35:35,421 --> 00:35:36,690
Let me work.

543
00:35:36,851 --> 00:35:38,361
I won't come often.

544
00:35:39,361 --> 00:35:42,560
I'll just come sometimes during the holidays to say hi.

545
00:35:43,131 --> 00:35:46,900
I should at least know where you are.

546
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:50,201
It makes me anxious if I don't.

547
00:35:50,201 --> 00:35:53,101
I hate you! I don't even want to look at you!

548
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:56,011
Everything was a mess ever since I adopted you.

549
00:35:56,011 --> 00:35:58,680
My husband's business went bankrupt, and my mom passed away.

550
00:35:59,041 --> 00:36:01,710
And after you came last time, I ran out of customers.

551
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:04,250
Is running out of customers my fault too?

552
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:06,451
I don't want to be mean to you either.

553
00:36:06,821 --> 00:36:10,220
So please, let's not see each other ever again.

554
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,690
You and I are ill-fated!

555
00:36:13,391 --> 00:36:14,960
It's been ages since I sent you away.

556
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,861
Why do you still chase after me and call me your mom?

557
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:19,930
If you have time to find me, go find your real mom.

558
00:36:21,361 --> 00:36:23,731
Can't you forgive me now?

559
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,401
I still...

560
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,111
have dreams about the fire.

561
00:36:31,271 --> 00:36:33,541
I'm being tormented by guilt too.

562
00:36:33,541 --> 00:36:35,310
I already forgave you for that.

563
00:36:35,781 --> 00:36:38,820
But you were creepy since the first time I saw you.

564
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:41,521
I tried to understand since you were abandoned...

565
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:43,521
and wanted to raise you with love.

566
00:36:44,351 --> 00:36:46,760
But I was wrong. I don't know why,

567
00:36:46,961 --> 00:36:48,630
but you were a sick child.

568
00:36:49,861 --> 00:36:52,430
I'm not doing this because you set that fire.

569
00:36:52,731 --> 00:36:55,771
So please don't come to me anymore and look for your real mom.

570
00:36:56,231 --> 00:36:58,841
Your misfortune is all because of your real mom.

571
00:37:10,151 --> 00:37:11,580
Stop it!

572
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:13,820
- Don't touch me! - Stop!

573
00:37:15,591 --> 00:37:17,291
Did you come here to do this?

574
00:37:17,521 --> 00:37:19,721
To throw a fit in front of me?

575
00:37:21,161 --> 00:37:23,231
I wanted to be forgiven.

576
00:37:24,231 --> 00:37:26,830
I came here to be forgiven.

577
00:37:27,231 --> 00:37:30,031
I wanted to be forgiven.

578
00:37:30,601 --> 00:37:32,700
Don't touch me.

579
00:37:34,101 --> 00:37:35,711
Don't touch me!

580
00:37:38,171 --> 00:37:41,310
You're out of your mind. You've totally lost it!

581
00:37:44,711 --> 00:37:46,450
I'm so sick and tired of you.

582
00:37:50,051 --> 00:37:53,021
I should've locked you up in a mental hospital.

583
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,930
I should've done it back then.

584
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:04,570
You're crazy.

585
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,771
You crazy brat!

586
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:13,640
The receiver cannot be reached. Please leave a message...

587
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:16,051
What on earth is she doing? I can't reach her.

588
00:38:16,051 --> 00:38:17,051
Darn.

589
00:38:20,721 --> 00:38:22,421
Dr. Lee, welcome.

590
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:24,291
Did you come to eat?

591
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:27,461
I can't get hold of Woo Joo.

592
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:30,390
She didn't come here either?

593
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:32,231
I can't reach her since last night.

594
00:38:33,661 --> 00:38:35,630
- Really? - Dr. Lee, you said yesterday...

595
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:37,601
that she said the owner of the chicken restaurant...

596
00:38:37,601 --> 00:38:38,671
changed, right?

597
00:38:38,671 --> 00:38:39,740
Yes.

598
00:38:40,771 --> 00:38:45,740
What does that chicken restaurant have to do with Woo Joo?

599
00:38:46,411 --> 00:38:49,711
Woo Joo's adoptive mother owned that place.

600
00:38:50,151 --> 00:38:51,351
Adoptive mother?

601
00:38:51,351 --> 00:38:53,921
She raised Woo Joo for about six years.

602
00:38:53,921 --> 00:38:55,021
Then...

603
00:38:56,690 --> 00:38:58,291
If the owner changed,

604
00:38:59,690 --> 00:39:03,531
that means she moved without Woo Joo knowing about it.

605
00:39:03,531 --> 00:39:05,731
It was her adoptive mother's birthday yesterday,

606
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,401
so she probably went to see her with a gift.

607
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:11,370
She probably drank all night and fell asleep somewhere.

608
00:39:12,471 --> 00:39:14,101
I'll go see if she's home.

609
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:17,171
(Gongbap Restaurant)

610
00:39:35,361 --> 00:39:36,461
Here we go.

611
00:39:38,231 --> 00:39:40,031
- Will it end here? - Okay, good.

612
00:39:40,031 --> 00:39:41,130
- We did it! - Yes!

613
00:39:45,301 --> 00:39:46,401
Nice shot!

614
00:39:46,401 --> 00:39:48,740
The game's over. You should all leave.

615
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:50,111
- Good game. - That was fun.

616
00:39:50,111 --> 00:39:52,580
- Good game. - Thank you.

617
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,240
Nurse Oh.

618
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:59,320
We have something to discuss with you.

619
00:39:59,551 --> 00:40:01,250
Discuss? What is it?

620
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:03,421
You heard about Noo Ri, right?

621
00:40:03,421 --> 00:40:05,760
I heard she took some time off. Is it serious?

622
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,560
She acted like it wasn't a big deal,

623
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,031
but I think she was just pretending to be okay.

624
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:13,130
She has a cranky personality, but she's so vulnerable mentally.

625
00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:14,430
Speaking of which,

626
00:40:14,731 --> 00:40:17,471
how can we help her in this type of situation?

627
00:40:18,401 --> 00:40:19,771
Aren't you on bad terms with her?

628
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:23,240
My goodness, I knew it. She knows everything.

629
00:40:24,671 --> 00:40:26,711
Our whole team knows about it.

630
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:29,151
In a situation like this,

631
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:33,120
there is one way to help Dr. Kang.

632
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,220
What is it?

633
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:44,430
The receiver cannot be reached. Please leave a message...

(Han Woo Joo)

638
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:18,460
- Hello? - Yes, what is it?

639
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:20,860
Where are you right now?

640
00:41:21,031 --> 00:41:22,301
What is this about?

641
00:41:24,171 --> 00:41:25,801
Regarding the stage therapy,

642
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,940
I think we should meet right now.

643
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:29,541
- I can't go today. - What?

644
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:32,710
Wait, but Woo Joo...

645
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,751
- Where are you right now? - I'm at home.

646
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:39,450
We'll stop at this rest area for 15 minutes.

647
00:41:39,881 --> 00:41:42,320
- When you get off the bus, - It doesn't seem like home.

648
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:44,551
- please take all your belongings. - I'm on my way to meet my mom.

649
00:41:44,551 --> 00:41:46,690
- Where to? - I'll call you later.

650
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,771
Woo Joo is on her way to see her mom.

651
00:41:56,771 --> 00:41:58,001
Do you know where it is?

652
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:01,570
It sounded like she was on an express bus.

653
00:42:06,141 --> 00:42:07,210
Thank you.

654
00:42:33,171 --> 00:42:35,470
Do you know what you need the most right now?

655
00:42:36,171 --> 00:42:37,310
A borderline patient.

656
00:42:37,310 --> 00:42:38,980
I'm sick of borderline patients.

657
00:42:39,881 --> 00:42:41,210
I never want to meet one again.

658
00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:42,980
Until when do you think you can avoid it?

659
00:42:43,911 --> 00:42:45,720
You must overcome it someday.

660
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,350
You know that...

661
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:49,820
a doctor grows once he meets a tough patient.

662
00:42:49,921 --> 00:42:53,261
I already lost a patient who could've helped me grow.

663
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:55,430
I'll never receive another chance.

664
00:42:55,430 --> 00:42:57,531
That person will appear in your life one day.

665
00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:00,661
Someone who will make you into a better doctor.

666
00:43:32,501 --> 00:43:33,761
I looked for you everywhere.

667
00:43:38,901 --> 00:43:40,470
How did you get here?

668
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:41,840
How did you find me?

669
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,470
You invited me over for chicken.

670
00:43:43,470 --> 00:43:44,970
I came for the chicken.

671
00:43:49,551 --> 00:43:53,320
Wow, this is amazing! It's the sea!

672
00:43:55,391 --> 00:43:57,051
How are you?

673
00:44:00,761 --> 00:44:01,860
Was this it?

674
00:44:03,730 --> 00:44:05,460
Where your mom carried you?

675
00:44:08,661 --> 00:44:09,771
Yes.

676
00:44:09,930 --> 00:44:11,830
That's why you said you left to see your mom.

677
00:44:23,151 --> 00:44:26,381
This is all I remember about my birth mom.

678
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:31,391
She left me at an orphanage when I was six.

679
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:35,491
I don't remember anything else.

680
00:44:36,730 --> 00:44:38,330
I deleted it all from my mind.

681
00:44:44,470 --> 00:44:47,100
I met a good set of adoptive parents...

682
00:44:49,041 --> 00:44:52,011
and lived happily until I was 12.

683
00:44:53,641 --> 00:44:55,041
But they abandoned me.

684
00:44:58,281 --> 00:45:00,180
The fried chicken place I mentioned yesterday.

685
00:45:00,881 --> 00:45:03,421
My adoptive mother owned it.

686
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:08,991
She quit without so much as a word to me.

687
00:45:12,090 --> 00:45:15,930
When a restaurant that you're a regular at closes,

688
00:45:15,970 --> 00:45:18,031
it's the worst feeling.

689
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:20,600
You feel angry and betrayed.

690
00:45:24,271 --> 00:45:25,610
Why won't you ask?

691
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:27,940
About what?

692
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:30,110
Why my adoptive parents abandoned me,

693
00:45:30,281 --> 00:45:33,551
and why I keep looking for her after what she did.

694
00:45:33,551 --> 00:45:36,090
Why would I make you bring up what must be sad memories?

695
00:45:36,421 --> 00:45:38,551
Tell me about it when you want to, like just now.

696
00:45:42,161 --> 00:45:43,330
I like how...

697
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:45,761
you won't ask.

698
00:45:45,761 --> 00:45:47,930
You have more memories to come...

699
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:50,171
compared to the ones you already have.

700
00:45:54,171 --> 00:45:55,301
How about...

701
00:45:57,041 --> 00:45:58,771
we not have fried chicken?

702
00:45:58,771 --> 00:46:00,781
I suddenly don't like it anymore.

703
00:46:01,781 --> 00:46:05,381
It's so greasy and I worry about my cholesterol levels.

704
00:46:06,381 --> 00:46:07,381
Okay, then.

705
00:46:16,930 --> 00:46:19,001
- What's that on your hand? - What?

706
00:46:20,301 --> 00:46:21,531
What happened?

707
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:23,131
It's nothing.

708
00:46:30,671 --> 00:46:32,940
Do you know how you feel?

709
00:46:33,411 --> 00:46:36,051
- What? - I don't know how I feel.

710
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:39,720
I miss my adoptive mother, but then I hate her.

711
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:43,121
I go from this to that a dozen times a day.

712
00:46:44,791 --> 00:46:46,121
But...

713
00:46:49,090 --> 00:46:52,330
are there people who are freaky and scary from birth?

714
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:55,531
How could there be such people?

715
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:59,440
The fact that you're born into this world is a blessing.

716
00:47:02,671 --> 00:47:04,310
Even if we were abandoned?

717
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:08,381
In life,

718
00:47:09,151 --> 00:47:11,980
how you were born isn't important at all.

719
00:47:12,551 --> 00:47:15,151
How you live is much more important.

720
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:19,960
You don't believe me?

721
00:47:20,021 --> 00:47:21,560
Then live a great life.

722
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:24,391
There will come a moment when you think of what I said.

723
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:32,901
I enjoyed the noodles. I'm so full.

724
00:47:37,570 --> 00:47:38,570
What's wrong?

725
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:41,141
I can't find my car key.

726
00:47:41,141 --> 00:47:42,310
Look carefully.

727
00:47:46,751 --> 00:47:47,781
It's gone.

728
00:47:49,491 --> 00:47:50,621
Wait here.

729
00:48:06,671 --> 00:48:08,671
- Did you find it? - No.

730
00:48:09,671 --> 00:48:13,781
I must've dropped it while running around looking for you.

731
00:48:13,781 --> 00:48:17,281
What should I do? Should I call the police?

732
00:48:17,281 --> 00:48:18,710
Let's look for it.

733
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:21,350
At this time of night?

734
00:48:54,151 --> 00:48:55,381
Woo Joo.

735
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:57,651
Woo Joo?

736
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:03,261
Woo Joo.

737
00:49:03,730 --> 00:49:04,960
Woo Joo.

738
00:49:33,090 --> 00:49:34,261
Woo Joo.

739
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:36,890
Woo Joo!

740
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:40,231
Woo Joo!

741
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:43,330
Han Woo Joo!

742
00:49:49,410 --> 00:49:50,840
I'm right here.

743
00:49:53,011 --> 00:49:54,981
Where were you?

744
00:49:55,211 --> 00:49:56,810
Didn't you hear me call you?

745
00:49:56,850 --> 00:49:59,281
Are you trying to make me lose my mind?

746
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:03,291
Why did you take off your shoes?

747
00:50:06,261 --> 00:50:08,221
I was looking for this.

748
00:50:10,531 --> 00:50:11,731
Where did you find it?

749
00:50:11,731 --> 00:50:13,801
You must've been really worried.

750
00:50:14,731 --> 00:50:16,600
Did you think I was dead?

751
00:50:17,301 --> 00:50:20,100
That I took off my shoes and jumped into the sea?

752
00:50:37,150 --> 00:50:39,160
Put on your shoes. Let's go home.

753
00:50:40,890 --> 00:50:42,560
It feels great...

754
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:44,731
to have someone worry about me.

755
00:50:44,731 --> 00:50:46,931
- Put them on already. - This is great.

756
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:20,630
How did you find it?

757
00:51:23,170 --> 00:51:25,201
I just noticed it.

758
00:51:27,201 --> 00:51:28,370
Like a miracle.

759
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:26,761
This is all I have to offer you.

760
00:52:26,761 --> 00:52:28,600
It's fine. Thank you.

761
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:30,971
- Please sit. - Okay.

762
00:52:41,281 --> 00:52:44,981
Is this where and how you sleep?

763
00:52:45,650 --> 00:52:49,890
Yes. We have no choice if we're to drive the first train.

764
00:52:50,221 --> 00:52:53,320
We get up an hour before to check the carriages.

765
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:56,261
I heard from our union that...

766
00:52:56,931 --> 00:52:58,961
you decided to help us.

767
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:03,031
Yes. I came to ask a few questions before that.

768
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:09,771
I heard there was an accident a month ago.

769
00:53:11,011 --> 00:53:13,410
Was it caused by a panic disorder?

770
00:53:15,310 --> 00:53:16,580
That accident?

771
00:53:51,350 --> 00:53:53,051
He felt suffocated.

772
00:53:53,951 --> 00:53:55,281
So he stopped the train...

773
00:53:55,991 --> 00:53:57,920
and just jumped out.

774
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:01,721
Right in front of an oncoming train.

775
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:08,630
We work alone,

776
00:54:08,931 --> 00:54:10,830
so if something like that happens,

777
00:54:11,971 --> 00:54:13,501
there's nothing we can do.

778
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:16,471
- Then were you... - Yes.

779
00:54:17,370 --> 00:54:21,681
I was diagnosed with a panic disorder.

780
00:54:23,011 --> 00:54:24,681
It got worse these days,

781
00:54:24,681 --> 00:54:26,981
so I have a convulsion whenever I board a train.

782
00:54:28,181 --> 00:54:31,150
It's practically terminal.

783
00:54:32,251 --> 00:54:35,090
Panic disorders can be cured.

784
00:54:35,090 --> 00:54:37,330
We will help you.

785
00:54:37,761 --> 00:54:42,031
Why would such a large hospital help people like us?

786
00:54:42,830 --> 00:54:45,971
Because we're doctors. Do we need another reason?

787
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:49,570
- Thank you so much. - My pleasure.

788
00:54:53,211 --> 00:54:55,140
I will leave, then.

789
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:57,150
Oh, okay. I'll take that for you.

790
00:54:57,150 --> 00:54:58,251
Thank you.

791
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:07,191
The man in the middle.

792
00:55:07,191 --> 00:55:08,991
Isn't this Assemblyman Ko Sang Moo?

793
00:55:09,761 --> 00:55:12,160
That's him. Of all the assemblymen,

794
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:15,261
he's the one who cares the most about our work environment.

795
00:55:17,170 --> 00:55:19,771
Is the man next to him a driver like you?

796
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:22,070
The man who died in the recent accident.

797
00:55:23,170 --> 00:55:24,370
That's him.

798
00:55:34,451 --> 00:55:35,781
Did you wait for a long time?

799
00:55:36,451 --> 00:55:38,691
No. I just got home.

800
00:55:40,521 --> 00:55:41,820
There's nothing to eat.

801
00:55:43,491 --> 00:55:45,491
You don't cook and just drink alcohol?

802
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:48,360
I eat at Gongbap Restaurant.

803
00:55:49,830 --> 00:55:51,170
You're in a good mood.

804
00:55:51,830 --> 00:55:53,801
Didn't you fight with your adoptive mom?

805
00:55:54,441 --> 00:55:56,170
I felt like I'd die,

806
00:55:58,211 --> 00:55:59,840
but Dr. Lee made me feel better.

807
00:56:00,281 --> 00:56:01,741
He's a good doctor.

808
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:03,681
He even went to the seaside.

809
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:06,120
He really worries about me a lot.

810
00:56:07,221 --> 00:56:08,820
Why is he so good to me?

811
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:12,420
Obviously it's because he's a doctor and you're his patient.

812
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:14,521
Wrong. It's more than that.

813
00:56:14,521 --> 00:56:16,991
- He has feelings for me. - I doubt that.

814
00:56:16,991 --> 00:56:17,991
It's true.

815
00:56:19,231 --> 00:56:20,801
Ji Hee told me that...

816
00:56:20,801 --> 00:56:22,870
Dr. Lee doesn't...

817
00:56:23,001 --> 00:56:25,570
see his patients just in his office.

818
00:56:25,570 --> 00:56:27,070
- Right. - Wherever they go,

819
00:56:27,070 --> 00:56:28,501
he goes with them.

820
00:56:28,501 --> 00:56:29,511
It's like...

821
00:56:30,110 --> 00:56:32,011
Was it Cha Dong Il? That fake cop.

822
00:56:32,011 --> 00:56:34,241
He even patrolled with that guy.

823
00:56:34,241 --> 00:56:35,241
Exactly.

824
00:56:36,610 --> 00:56:37,951
And takes patients on walks.

825
00:56:38,251 --> 00:56:40,251
Didn't he take you to a landfill...

826
00:56:40,251 --> 00:56:41,650
to throw away your watch?

827
00:56:41,650 --> 00:56:43,721
That is how Dr. Lee treats people.

828
00:56:43,721 --> 00:56:45,390
I know that.

829
00:56:47,461 --> 00:56:49,791
Today, I saw his true emotions.

830
00:56:50,991 --> 00:56:52,031
To him,

831
00:56:53,031 --> 00:56:54,560
I am special.

832
00:56:56,001 --> 00:56:57,100
So...

833
00:56:58,431 --> 00:57:00,640
People who see psychiatrists...

834
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:03,340
tend to get the wrong idea about...

835
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:05,140
their doctors' good intentions.

836
00:57:05,570 --> 00:57:09,511
Because they listen so intently and are so kind and gentle.

837
00:57:09,511 --> 00:57:11,181
I didn't get the wrong idea.

838
00:57:22,390 --> 00:57:23,761
- Woo Joo. - Yes.

839
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:26,501
Did you know that...

840
00:57:27,630 --> 00:57:30,201
Dr. Ji sent you to Dr. Lee?

841
00:57:30,201 --> 00:57:31,330
What are you talking about?

842
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:33,370
Why would she do that?

843
00:57:33,370 --> 00:57:35,041
- Said who? - I heard it myself.

844
00:57:36,041 --> 00:57:38,971
When a doctor sends a patient to another doctor,

845
00:57:39,471 --> 00:57:42,281
isn't it because there's only one reason?

846
00:57:48,551 --> 00:57:51,350
If Dr. Lee really thinks you're special,

847
00:57:51,650 --> 00:57:52,991
wouldn't it be that reason?

848
00:57:55,721 --> 00:57:56,791
Here.

849
00:57:58,590 --> 00:57:59,931
Assemblyman Ko and Seoul City...

850
00:57:59,931 --> 00:58:02,400
set up a team to improve the drivers' working conditions.

851
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:03,830
The two-driver system...

852
00:58:03,830 --> 00:58:05,731
was scrapped due to budget reasons.

853
00:58:07,070 --> 00:58:09,301
Basically, someone died...

854
00:58:09,301 --> 00:58:11,271
as a victim of the solo system.

855
00:58:12,041 --> 00:58:15,140
Because of that, Assemblyman Ko must be plagued by guilt.

856
00:58:16,211 --> 00:58:18,910
That would've caused acute stress.

857
00:58:18,910 --> 00:58:21,521
If we get rid of Assemblyman Ko's guilt,

858
00:58:21,521 --> 00:58:22,781
his tic will disappear too.

859
00:58:22,781 --> 00:58:24,390
How can we eliminate his guilt?

860
00:58:24,390 --> 00:58:26,021
A man's already dead.

861
00:58:26,021 --> 00:58:28,261
If he were able to value his promise,

862
00:58:28,261 --> 00:58:29,461
wouldn't that help?

863
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:31,560
It would,

864
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:34,560
but that's not something that can happen overnight.

865
00:58:43,870 --> 00:58:45,410
HRT, was it?

866
00:58:48,211 --> 00:58:51,251
I think that has been a great help.

867
00:58:51,251 --> 00:58:53,981
The medication is only temporary relief.

868
00:58:54,150 --> 00:58:57,850
Then my tic will come back when I go off the medication?

869
00:59:00,191 --> 00:59:04,830
I think I figured out the cause of your tic.

870
00:59:05,031 --> 00:59:06,191
Did you really?

871
00:59:13,471 --> 00:59:15,600
Do you remember this man?

872
00:59:26,251 --> 00:59:27,781
There's a subway line...

873
00:59:28,781 --> 00:59:31,691
that the drivers call "Hades Line".

874
00:59:32,191 --> 00:59:34,721
A dark, endless tunnel.

875
00:59:34,721 --> 00:59:36,360
They can't take toilet breaks,

876
00:59:37,130 --> 00:59:39,360
and some even wet themselves.

877
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:43,870
It broke my heart to hear that.

878
00:59:44,271 --> 00:59:45,971
That's why you promised him that...

879
00:59:45,971 --> 00:59:49,301
you'd ensure they could work in teams of two.

880
00:59:49,810 --> 00:59:51,771
While you were unable to keep your promise,

881
00:59:52,241 --> 00:59:54,211
that man lost his life.

882
00:59:55,310 --> 00:59:56,511
It all felt like...

883
00:59:57,810 --> 00:59:59,451
my fault.

884
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:08,721
Shall I give you an injection?

885
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:11,660
No. It's fine.

886
01:00:14,001 --> 01:00:15,660
Thinking of that driver...

887
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:20,600
brought back my fellow citizens at a higher speed.

888
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:33,080
I'm not the one who can cure your illness.

889
01:00:34,981 --> 01:00:36,251
You are.

890
01:00:37,551 --> 01:00:41,191
Of course, we can reduce the symptoms with medication,

891
01:00:41,721 --> 01:00:43,961
but that's only a temporary remedy.

892
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:45,961
The true treatment...

893
01:00:48,201 --> 01:00:50,630
is something only you can do.

894
01:01:22,660 --> 01:01:24,701
Isn't Ms. Han Woo Joo scheduled for 4 p.m.?

895
01:01:28,741 --> 01:01:30,771
What do you want to confirm with me?

896
01:01:30,941 --> 01:01:32,410
I heard that you...

897
01:01:33,511 --> 01:01:35,981
referred me to Dr. Lee Si Joon.

898
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:39,181
No. I didn't refer you to...

899
01:01:39,181 --> 01:01:41,120
What is it that I have?

900
01:01:42,150 --> 01:01:43,650
What do I have...

901
01:01:43,650 --> 01:01:46,120
that you had to send me off in secret?

902
01:01:47,590 --> 01:01:49,931
Why did you send me to Lee Si Joon?

903
01:02:13,051 --> 01:02:15,781
(Fix You)

904
01:02:16,221 --> 01:02:17,890
You abandoned me!

905
01:02:17,890 --> 01:02:20,920
She might be fixated on you even more out of her anger for me.

906
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:23,531
I think it's fate that we met.

907
01:02:23,531 --> 01:02:25,560
He has a fit almost every day,

908
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:26,900
and you want him to drive?

909
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:29,060
Do you think that makes sense?

910
01:02:29,060 --> 01:02:30,501
Are you turning into Lee Si Joon?

911
01:02:30,501 --> 01:02:33,301
For panic disorders at least, I want to treat them Si Joon's way.

912
01:02:33,301 --> 01:02:36,140
They walked with arms linked? In the hospital?

913
01:02:36,140 --> 01:02:38,570
This is fate. It has to be fate.

914
01:02:38,570 --> 01:02:40,241
Just because we feel anxious...

915
01:02:40,241 --> 01:02:41,941
doesn't mean we must become timid.

916
01:02:41,941 --> 01:02:44,080
The patient you put in charge of stage therapy.

917
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:45,451
Make her quit immediately.
