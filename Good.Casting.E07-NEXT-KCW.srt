1
00:00:05,912 --> 00:00:11,952
(This drama is fictitious and all characters, events,
organizations, and settings are unrelated to real life.)

2
00:00:27,857 --> 00:00:29,496
Be careful of the control system...

3
00:00:29,626 --> 00:00:33,297
and disconnect the power by cutting
the third wire from the left.

4
00:00:41,336 --> 00:00:43,376
- Step back.
- But...

5
00:01:17,236 --> 00:01:18,236
It's you, isn't it?

6
00:01:18,876 --> 00:01:20,046
You're Michael.

7
00:01:32,557 --> 00:01:33,557
It's fine.

8
00:01:35,796 --> 00:01:36,956
Good.

9
00:01:39,427 --> 00:01:40,496
We checked the files.

10
00:01:40,496 --> 00:01:42,637
Will someone else
make the third delivery?

11
00:01:42,637 --> 00:01:43,837
No, no.

12
00:01:44,496 --> 00:01:45,637
I'll make the third delivery myself.

13
00:01:45,637 --> 00:01:48,106
Okay. Very well.

14
00:01:48,106 --> 00:01:49,436
Good? Okay.

15
00:01:50,177 --> 00:01:52,106
- Thank you.
- It's fine.

16
00:01:52,106 --> 00:01:54,007
Thank you.

17
00:01:56,846 --> 00:01:57,917
Bye-bye.

18
00:02:05,557 --> 00:02:07,527
It's over at last.

19
00:02:08,856 --> 00:02:12,397
Tick-tock, tick-tock.

20
00:02:19,067 --> 00:02:21,567
What? Why is it ticking again?

21
00:02:21,567 --> 00:02:24,776
There must be another bomb.

22
00:02:25,276 --> 00:02:26,306
What?

23
00:02:30,377 --> 00:02:33,046
Just kill me already, will you?

24
00:02:33,317 --> 00:02:34,317
Get it off him.

25
00:02:45,667 --> 00:02:46,766
I love you.

26
00:02:47,997 --> 00:02:49,137
I love you.

27
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:55,007
I won't let you leave alone.

28
00:02:57,877 --> 00:02:59,776
Why didn't you untie me earlier?

29
00:03:00,407 --> 00:03:02,046
You could've done this earlier.

30
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:17,426
Let's run.

31
00:03:19,967 --> 00:03:21,396
Out of the way!

32
00:03:30,806 --> 00:03:31,877
Move!

33
00:04:02,106 --> 00:04:05,776
The receiver cannot be reached.
You will be directed to voicemail.

34
00:04:06,176 --> 00:04:08,407
You will be charged after the beep.

35
00:04:12,276 --> 00:04:15,016
The receiver cannot be reached.
You will be directed to voicemail.

36
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:55,086
It's a welcome gift.

37
00:04:55,956 --> 00:04:59,326
I'm bribing you so that
you'll stay with us for years.

38
00:05:12,507 --> 00:05:14,547
(Good Casting)

39
00:05:24,487 --> 00:05:25,487
(Episode 7)

40
00:05:25,487 --> 00:05:28,586
Why are you out already?
You should've finished your IV drip.

41
00:05:30,857 --> 00:05:32,867
Where is Ye Eun?
Why is she not here?

42
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,166
Ye Eun?

43
00:05:34,997 --> 00:05:36,766
Did something happen?

44
00:05:36,766 --> 00:05:38,937
You're in no place
to be worried about me.

45
00:05:41,937 --> 00:05:43,036
I really thought...

46
00:05:43,937 --> 00:05:45,846
you might die.

47
00:05:46,476 --> 00:05:48,677
Do you know how scared I was?

48
00:05:49,247 --> 00:05:50,447
Why are you so angry?

49
00:05:50,776 --> 00:05:51,846
Don't ask.

50
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:53,846
From now on,

51
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:56,716
try not to get hurt so much.

52
00:06:00,427 --> 00:06:01,627
I'm sorry.

53
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:03,997
Yes, you should be.

54
00:06:04,526 --> 00:06:07,697
If you die during a mission,

55
00:06:07,997 --> 00:06:10,237
our Team Leader Dung
will have to stay up all night...

56
00:06:10,237 --> 00:06:11,637
to write up a report.

57
00:06:11,836 --> 00:06:13,137
Your doctor says...

58
00:06:13,507 --> 00:06:16,476
it's just a small fracture,
so you'll be fine in 2 to 3 weeks.

59
00:06:16,637 --> 00:06:17,637
Hang in there until then.

60
00:06:17,637 --> 00:06:20,007
(Congratulations on
returning to the field.)

61
00:06:22,177 --> 00:06:23,247
What about Pi Cheol Woong?

62
00:06:23,846 --> 00:06:26,617
(NIS Sheltered Ward)

63
00:06:30,786 --> 00:06:34,557
Pi Cheol Woong had a seizure
the moment he woke up.

64
00:06:34,826 --> 00:06:35,997
I'm not surprised.

65
00:06:36,656 --> 00:06:39,896
He almost died wearing a bomb vest.

66
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:43,067
He's weaker than he looks.

67
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:46,007
He was given sedatives
and barely fell asleep.

68
00:06:48,567 --> 00:06:49,607
Not only...

69
00:06:51,276 --> 00:06:53,406
did those guys
try to use him as a parcel box,

70
00:06:53,976 --> 00:06:56,016
but they even put a bomb on him.

71
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:59,317
They probably wanted
all of us dead.

72
00:07:01,786 --> 00:07:04,387
Anyway, now that they stole
the chip,

73
00:07:04,887 --> 00:07:05,956
what are we going to do?

74
00:07:06,127 --> 00:07:07,226
What's there to ask?

75
00:07:08,487 --> 00:07:10,427
We're going to do
exactly what they did to us.

76
00:07:17,367 --> 00:07:18,567
What is your problem?

77
00:07:19,507 --> 00:07:21,266
You told me you'll catch Michael...

78
00:07:21,266 --> 00:07:23,307
and stop him
from leaking the technology.

79
00:07:23,307 --> 00:07:26,107
You badgered me
as if it was extremely urgent,

80
00:07:26,107 --> 00:07:27,307
so I gave you my approval!

81
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:32,617
But the culprit
came back as a corpse.

82
00:07:32,617 --> 00:07:34,547
The only witness is half-crazy.

83
00:07:34,646 --> 00:07:35,846
And you don't even know...

84
00:07:35,987 --> 00:07:38,987
if the technology was leaked or not!

85
00:07:40,487 --> 00:07:41,687
We didn't expect...

86
00:07:42,627 --> 00:07:44,326
Chief Tak to suddenly
get in the way.

87
00:07:44,326 --> 00:07:45,757
Don't use him as an excuse.

88
00:07:46,197 --> 00:07:48,627
You should've thought of
all the possible options.

89
00:07:49,297 --> 00:07:50,536
It was your job...

90
00:07:50,966 --> 00:07:52,666
to have multiple plans ready...

91
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:54,007
prior to carrying out the mission!

92
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:55,607
Someone must've...

93
00:07:56,377 --> 00:07:58,007
leaked inside information.

94
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:01,646
What did you just say?

95
00:08:01,646 --> 00:08:02,916
We found out about
Pi Cheol Woong's departure...

96
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:04,346
two hours prior to his flight.

97
00:08:04,516 --> 00:08:05,747
But Chief Tak...

98
00:08:05,846 --> 00:08:07,586
was already on the plane.

99
00:08:11,216 --> 00:08:12,357
We'll be able to find something...

100
00:08:12,956 --> 00:08:14,586
if we take a look
at Chief Tak's whereabouts...

101
00:08:15,726 --> 00:08:17,257
prior to his departure.

102
00:08:21,867 --> 00:08:22,896
You're right.

103
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:25,536
I've been feeling uneasy
about this mission...

104
00:08:26,836 --> 00:08:28,067
ever since Baek Chan Mi
joined the team.

105
00:08:29,036 --> 00:08:30,737
What do you mean?

106
00:08:32,507 --> 00:08:33,547
What?

107
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:36,276
You just said so yourself.

108
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:39,177
You said you think there's a mole.

109
00:08:39,346 --> 00:08:40,947
That's just an assumption.

110
00:08:40,947 --> 00:08:42,047
It can't be...

111
00:08:42,516 --> 00:08:43,586
Agent Baek.

112
00:08:43,586 --> 00:08:45,117
She already betrayed us once.

113
00:08:45,887 --> 00:08:47,656
Who says she won't do it again?

114
00:08:48,627 --> 00:08:49,896
It's all my fault.

115
00:08:51,026 --> 00:08:52,097
I'll take...

116
00:08:53,597 --> 00:08:55,026
full responsibility
for what happened.

117
00:08:58,266 --> 00:09:00,467
Deal with the darn corpse first.

118
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:01,967
It's starting to stink.

119
00:09:03,406 --> 00:09:04,676
Don't just stand there and get lost.

120
00:09:10,617 --> 00:09:12,347
The chief must be really angry.

121
00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:15,046
He normally
doesn't even talk that much.

122
00:09:15,046 --> 00:09:16,987
And Team Manager Dung
is really boring.

123
00:09:16,987 --> 00:09:18,816
I'm surprised they're still
talking to each other.

124
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:32,396
Yoon Seok Ho
could still be the culprit.

125
00:09:32,566 --> 00:09:34,936
I know for a fact
that it's not him.

126
00:09:36,477 --> 00:09:37,607
What do you know?

127
00:09:37,607 --> 00:09:38,776
Yoon Seok Ho.

128
00:09:39,176 --> 00:09:40,977
He would never do
something like that.

129
00:09:42,676 --> 00:09:45,276
Now that I think about it,

130
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:47,646
you've been pretty strange lately.

131
00:09:47,847 --> 00:09:49,757
Spill it.
Something's going on, isn't it?

132
00:09:49,786 --> 00:09:50,857
Yes.

133
00:09:51,117 --> 00:09:52,827
I'm a field agent,
and he's my target.

134
00:09:53,056 --> 00:09:54,487
What more do you expect?

135
00:09:54,957 --> 00:09:58,857
If Kang Woo Won is no longer
a possible suspect,

136
00:09:59,327 --> 00:10:02,166
can I also stop tailing him
in the field?

137
00:10:02,896 --> 00:10:05,536
Did you seduce him instead
of keeping an eye on him?

138
00:10:05,536 --> 00:10:06,637
My gosh, are you kidding?

139
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,737
When did I ever do something
like that during a mission?

140
00:10:08,766 --> 00:10:09,837
Give me that.

141
00:10:11,707 --> 00:10:14,276
Your response tells me
there really is something going on.

142
00:10:16,477 --> 00:10:17,717
Stop talking nonsense.

143
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:22,087
Pi Cheol Woong is all we have.

144
00:10:22,617 --> 00:10:24,186
But he's not sane,

145
00:10:24,186 --> 00:10:26,327
so we won't be able
to make him testify.

146
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:30,056
Have you ladies thought about
how we should convince...

147
00:10:30,457 --> 00:10:31,696
Director Myeong and Mr. Ok?

148
00:10:31,757 --> 00:10:34,526
I'd love to participate
until the very end.

149
00:10:34,896 --> 00:10:37,497
But as you already know,
I have to go home...

150
00:10:37,497 --> 00:10:39,296
and cook for my husband and child.

151
00:10:39,936 --> 00:10:42,007
I'll be off now.

152
00:10:42,536 --> 00:10:43,707
See you.

153
00:10:44,737 --> 00:10:47,207
Hwang Mi Soon. Hey.

154
00:10:59,087 --> 00:11:02,857
Just go home. Go ahead. Leave.

155
00:11:08,597 --> 00:11:10,396
Ms. Baek, why are you still here?

156
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:13,607
If I go home,
I'll just be staring at the TV.

157
00:11:14,066 --> 00:11:16,477
I'd rather stay here
and watch something productive.

158
00:11:16,837 --> 00:11:19,276
I watched that for days,
but nothing came up.

159
00:11:20,607 --> 00:11:21,906
Isn't that even weirder?

160
00:11:22,607 --> 00:11:24,516
The fact that someone stole
the technology...

161
00:11:24,516 --> 00:11:26,916
means someone leaked information
from inside the lab.

162
00:11:27,786 --> 00:11:31,117
But isn't it even weirder
that Mr. Ok seems so fine...

163
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:33,186
when he's the key figure?

164
00:11:33,487 --> 00:11:36,127
Ms. Baek, you should stop
being such a workaholic.

165
00:11:36,327 --> 00:11:38,227
It's time to get yourself a guy.

166
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:39,796
I'm popular.

167
00:11:40,227 --> 00:11:42,066
I still have tons of people...

168
00:11:42,066 --> 00:11:43,536
trying to set me up on blind dates.

169
00:11:46,607 --> 00:11:48,867
My gosh, why does he keep
moving his head?

170
00:12:03,286 --> 00:12:05,286
Classical music
doesn't suit him at all.

171
00:12:19,337 --> 00:12:22,536
They were supposed to take out
the recyclables yesterday.

172
00:12:23,137 --> 00:12:27,176
I told them not to forget
so many times.

173
00:12:27,477 --> 00:12:29,306
I told them again and again.

174
00:12:29,816 --> 00:12:31,776
My gosh, I can't believe this.

175
00:12:32,046 --> 00:12:34,916
This place will turn into a pigpen
if I'm not around.

176
00:12:35,316 --> 00:12:37,556
They'd be better off living as pigs.

177
00:12:38,156 --> 00:12:40,627
What's the use of being human
when they're this dirty?

178
00:12:41,487 --> 00:12:43,357
(Good Dew, original flavor)

179
00:12:45,156 --> 00:12:46,827
Why is there a soju pack?

180
00:12:49,396 --> 00:12:50,837
Did you drink soju?

181
00:12:51,367 --> 00:12:53,166
Did you drink soju?

182
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:54,936
Don't you know I prefer beer?

183
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:56,607
Didn't you mix soju with beer?

184
00:12:57,207 --> 00:13:00,207
You know that
I can't stomach mixed drinks.

185
00:13:32,036 --> 00:13:33,546
Cigarette ash?

186
00:13:57,967 --> 00:14:01,337
(Report Card)

187
00:14:25,926 --> 00:14:29,097
I told her to study
and instead she's...

188
00:14:32,896 --> 00:14:35,367
I shouldn't rip up
photos of other people's kids.

189
00:14:43,316 --> 00:14:45,446
(Ointment)

190
00:14:46,016 --> 00:14:47,247
What's all this?

191
00:14:48,146 --> 00:14:51,316
(Ointment)

192
00:14:58,896 --> 00:15:01,266
Honey! You got a text!

193
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:06,036
You got a text!

194
00:15:09,837 --> 00:15:12,507
Is that woman going deaf?

195
00:15:13,847 --> 00:15:15,977
(Overseas roaming canceled.)

196
00:15:15,977 --> 00:15:18,347
What? Roaming?

197
00:15:23,587 --> 00:15:26,686
So, is your mother doing okay?

198
00:15:27,127 --> 00:15:29,056
She's just the same.

199
00:15:29,056 --> 00:15:31,357
She complains of the pain,
then a few days later...

200
00:15:31,357 --> 00:15:34,097
My gosh. I told you
not to drink from the bottle.

201
00:15:34,097 --> 00:15:35,396
It's gross.

202
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:40,436
I should give her a call then.

203
00:15:40,436 --> 00:15:41,436
What for?

204
00:15:41,867 --> 00:15:44,306
Why? Can't I call her?

205
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:47,176
Well,

206
00:15:47,507 --> 00:15:48,806
if you call,

207
00:15:48,806 --> 00:15:51,577
the old woman
will just act up even more.

208
00:15:52,016 --> 00:15:53,946
Don't call her all the time.

209
00:15:56,117 --> 00:15:59,587
Did Joo Yeon come home early?

210
00:16:00,186 --> 00:16:03,396
I think she came straight back
from her after school lessons.

211
00:16:03,597 --> 00:16:04,656
Did she?

212
00:16:10,396 --> 00:16:13,306
(Il Kwang Hitech)

213
00:16:18,676 --> 00:16:20,007
How did you hurt your arm?

214
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:23,977
I was taking care of personal
business over the weekend...

215
00:16:23,977 --> 00:16:25,416
and hurt myself slightly.

216
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:27,046
That's not slight.

217
00:16:27,046 --> 00:16:29,046
I'll make sure
it doesn't hinder my work.

218
00:16:32,156 --> 00:16:33,257
What do you do on weekends?

219
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:34,426
Why do you ask?

220
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:36,556
Because you hurt yourself
each weekend.

221
00:16:37,727 --> 00:16:39,497
Are you maybe into kickboxing?

222
00:16:46,196 --> 00:16:47,266
As if.

223
00:16:47,266 --> 00:16:51,477
Or are you into dangerous hobbies?

224
00:16:53,347 --> 00:16:54,477
Hey!

225
00:17:00,646 --> 00:17:03,457
I'm not the type to
risk my life just for a hobby.

226
00:17:03,656 --> 00:17:05,387
You don't hang out with...

227
00:17:05,387 --> 00:17:08,227
dangerous people, do you?

228
00:17:15,997 --> 00:17:19,297
I'm surrounded by ordinary people.

229
00:17:19,436 --> 00:17:20,837
It's almost boring.

230
00:17:23,006 --> 00:17:25,107
Then I should've taken you with me.

231
00:17:25,476 --> 00:17:27,006
- Pardon?
- The first few months...

232
00:17:27,006 --> 00:17:29,777
at a new job is tough
because you're trying to settle in.

233
00:17:30,017 --> 00:17:31,817
If I brought you along
on my business trips,

234
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:33,986
I was afraid you'd call me
a terrible boss,

235
00:17:34,117 --> 00:17:35,986
so I left you behind to rest.

236
00:17:35,986 --> 00:17:37,256
And you just get hurt.

237
00:17:37,887 --> 00:17:39,416
I should've taken you with me.

238
00:17:40,186 --> 00:17:43,087
Chief Secretary Byun
pushes his staff really hard,

239
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:44,597
and I'm concerned.

240
00:17:45,327 --> 00:17:46,327
About what?

241
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:48,597
In case...

242
00:17:49,367 --> 00:17:51,037
you end up resigning.

243
00:17:52,067 --> 00:17:55,006
But then,
when I see you at your desk,

244
00:17:55,006 --> 00:17:56,506
I'm relieved.

245
00:17:58,476 --> 00:18:00,307
But not that you get hurt.

246
00:18:01,976 --> 00:18:04,877
Don't get hurt again.
I get concerned.

247
00:18:26,537 --> 00:18:30,906
(15 years ago)

248
00:18:33,506 --> 00:18:34,577
Please leave.

249
00:18:34,976 --> 00:18:37,877
I won't stay for long.
I just want to see him.

250
00:18:39,216 --> 00:18:40,486
You signed a contract...

251
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:42,186
that states once it expires,

252
00:18:42,186 --> 00:18:44,256
you are no longer
permitted to see him in private.

253
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:47,587
I want to see him as a friend,
not as someone I once taught.

254
00:18:48,057 --> 00:18:50,297
That's why we cannot allow it.

255
00:18:50,297 --> 00:18:51,327
Please leave.

256
00:18:57,137 --> 00:18:59,496
(Seok Ho)

257
00:19:24,226 --> 00:19:25,597
I'll leave you to your work.

258
00:19:39,476 --> 00:19:40,476
Who's that?

259
00:19:43,746 --> 00:19:44,946
You hired a woman?

260
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:47,716
Why are you here?

261
00:19:49,117 --> 00:19:50,787
You don't let women in your office.

262
00:19:50,787 --> 00:19:52,517
You prefer to meet them outside.

263
00:19:53,827 --> 00:19:55,587
If you're here to be nosy,

264
00:19:55,587 --> 00:19:57,127
just finish your tea and leave.

265
00:19:58,156 --> 00:19:59,226
I'm busy.

266
00:19:59,496 --> 00:20:01,396
Can't I even say that?

267
00:20:02,097 --> 00:20:03,097
Between us?

268
00:20:03,226 --> 00:20:05,537
I'll pretend I accepted your advice.

269
00:20:10,206 --> 00:20:11,877
The tea tastes terrible.

270
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:13,577
It makes my mouth dry.

271
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:16,877
Does your secretary
not manage your pantry well?

272
00:20:17,146 --> 00:20:20,087
Why? Does the tea
Director Myeong serves...

273
00:20:20,087 --> 00:20:21,817
taste just amazing?

274
00:20:22,246 --> 00:20:23,517
The day before yesterday,

275
00:20:23,817 --> 00:20:26,087
he flew to Henan Province.

276
00:20:26,087 --> 00:20:28,327
He must have bought
some expensive puer tea.

277
00:20:29,156 --> 00:20:30,926
I'm a shareholder of this company.

278
00:20:30,956 --> 00:20:33,567
Why act like it's odd for me to
spend time with the management?

279
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:37,196
You're the CEO.
You shouldn't be so closed-minded.

280
00:20:42,637 --> 00:20:44,107
Mr. Byun.

281
00:20:44,107 --> 00:20:46,777
He has a female guest.

282
00:20:51,577 --> 00:20:53,047
It must be his wife.

283
00:20:53,317 --> 00:20:54,547
His wife?

284
00:20:54,547 --> 00:20:55,787
Why are you so shocked?

285
00:20:56,646 --> 00:20:59,017
Because she's so beautiful.

286
00:20:59,017 --> 00:21:00,857
Yes, she is beautiful.

287
00:21:02,557 --> 00:21:04,357
Seok Ho was married?

288
00:21:05,196 --> 00:21:07,166
But then, he is old enough...

289
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:09,166
to be married with 2 or 3 kids.

290
00:21:09,797 --> 00:21:11,966
Should I call her his ex-wife?

291
00:21:12,696 --> 00:21:14,137
They got divorced.

292
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:19,206
Why didn't I see that on his file?

293
00:21:19,637 --> 00:21:21,577
Ms. Baek, put these in a vase...

294
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:23,347
and put them in the CEO's office.

295
00:21:23,946 --> 00:21:27,887
CEO Yoon doesn't like these flowers.

296
00:21:27,887 --> 00:21:30,256
Do you know his taste in flowers?

297
00:21:30,256 --> 00:21:32,756
Exactly how well do you know him?

298
00:21:32,956 --> 00:21:35,057
Do you know him
better than his ex-wife,

299
00:21:35,057 --> 00:21:38,156
or better than me
who served him for eight years?

300
00:21:38,156 --> 00:21:39,226
Do you?

301
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:42,097
Of course not.

302
00:21:42,466 --> 00:21:43,996
I'll do as you said.

303
00:21:44,496 --> 00:21:45,537
Do it.

304
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:00,077
My father will soon
announce his candidacy.

305
00:22:00,077 --> 00:22:01,787
Why are you telling me that?

306
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:02,916
You know that...

307
00:22:02,916 --> 00:22:05,587
I tend to be very well-prepared.

308
00:22:07,156 --> 00:22:08,226
I do know that.

309
00:22:08,587 --> 00:22:10,226
Before we even met,

310
00:22:10,226 --> 00:22:12,496
you wrote a prenuptial agreement
for me to sign.

311
00:22:12,496 --> 00:22:15,666
Isn't that much better than
the heir to a company...

312
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:17,696
who was forced by
his parents to marry,

313
00:22:17,797 --> 00:22:21,236
and did so without a plan
as if he were eating a meal?

314
00:22:21,236 --> 00:22:23,807
Stop beating around the bush
and get to the point.

315
00:22:25,607 --> 00:22:27,176
It's too boring to listen to.

316
00:22:40,827 --> 00:22:43,357
You'll need some time
to prepare a slush fund,

317
00:22:43,627 --> 00:22:44,926
so I came to give you a heads up.

318
00:22:45,226 --> 00:22:47,496
It's never a good thing for people
to be so consistent.

319
00:22:48,797 --> 00:22:50,767
People should change at times
in order to become more mature.

320
00:22:50,767 --> 00:22:51,867
What's wrong with that?

321
00:22:52,067 --> 00:22:55,006
From the moment we got married,

322
00:22:55,936 --> 00:22:58,637
I've loved no one else but you.

323
00:22:59,607 --> 00:23:00,676
My heart stays consistent.

324
00:23:00,877 --> 00:23:03,577
"Consistent"? Yes, you're right.

325
00:23:04,117 --> 00:23:05,347
You care only about my money.

326
00:23:07,587 --> 00:23:10,117
I really like
how consistently honest you are.

327
00:23:11,517 --> 00:23:14,456
I also look forward to hearing
how much you can provide.

328
00:23:42,047 --> 00:23:43,287
This is so awkward.

329
00:23:44,317 --> 00:23:46,186
I've never seen a woman
in his office before.

330
00:23:58,567 --> 00:24:01,236
(My dear niece, you didn't forget
our meeting on Saturday, right?)

331
00:24:06,337 --> 00:24:07,676
You'd better keep your promise...

332
00:24:07,676 --> 00:24:10,146
and leave me be until I'm done
with my project at work.

333
00:24:10,446 --> 00:24:12,416
I swear this is the last time.

334
00:25:21,587 --> 00:25:23,017
The ramyeon here tastes great.

335
00:25:23,287 --> 00:25:25,357
Then I'll have
ramyeon with dumplings...

336
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,256
- Ramyeon with rice cakes, please.
- Okay.

337
00:25:28,857 --> 00:25:30,756
- We'll take two.
- Okay.

338
00:25:37,137 --> 00:25:40,067
Is your mother's condition
really bad?

339
00:25:41,666 --> 00:25:43,067
She's getting better.

340
00:25:43,307 --> 00:25:45,736
She seemed healthy
when I last met her.

341
00:25:48,107 --> 00:25:49,746
She'll get better soon.

342
00:25:50,646 --> 00:25:51,916
I'm sure she'll recover.

343
00:25:56,287 --> 00:25:57,357
It's here.

344
00:25:58,287 --> 00:25:59,456
- Thank you.
- No problem.

345
00:25:59,456 --> 00:26:01,387
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

346
00:26:11,396 --> 00:26:12,597
Do you not like green onions?

347
00:26:13,067 --> 00:26:15,607
No, they're too spicy
when they're not cooked.

348
00:26:16,267 --> 00:26:17,377
There are so many.

349
00:26:17,637 --> 00:26:19,006
I'll have them.

350
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:33,887
- Gosh, it's hot.
- Take your time.

351
00:26:37,097 --> 00:26:38,127
My gosh.

352
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:44,267
The rice cakes are delicious.

353
00:26:50,607 --> 00:26:52,206
Will you grant me a wish...

354
00:26:53,006 --> 00:26:54,146
if I get better grades this time?

355
00:26:55,777 --> 00:26:56,906
What's your wish?

356
00:27:55,307 --> 00:27:56,466
Someone must've...

357
00:27:56,767 --> 00:27:58,577
leaked inside information.

358
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:00,137
We found out about
Pi Cheol Woong's departure...

359
00:28:00,137 --> 00:28:01,577
two hours prior to his flight.

360
00:28:01,706 --> 00:28:04,817
But Chief Tak was
already on the plane.

361
00:28:05,547 --> 00:28:07,146
We'll find something if we take
a look at Chief Tak's whereabouts...

362
00:28:07,347 --> 00:28:08,716
prior to his departure.

363
00:28:10,387 --> 00:28:12,057
Pi Cheol Woong will be...

364
00:28:12,057 --> 00:28:14,426
on a flight
that departs in two hours.

365
00:29:04,137 --> 00:29:06,236
(Michael: This afternoon, 1 p.m.,
the cafe in Royal Hotel)

366
00:29:06,236 --> 00:29:07,847
Sir!

367
00:29:07,906 --> 00:29:09,206
Micheal sent him a text.

368
00:29:11,317 --> 00:29:12,416
Zoom in.

369
00:29:15,716 --> 00:29:18,387
(Michael: This afternoon, 1 p.m.,
the cafe in Royal Hotel)

370
00:29:28,097 --> 00:29:30,666
What are you waiting for?
Call everyone.

371
00:29:31,097 --> 00:29:32,166
Yes, sir.

372
00:29:36,797 --> 00:29:38,666
All right.
We now have a good chance.

373
00:29:39,837 --> 00:29:41,737
Let's do this. Give me a grand slam.

374
00:29:45,106 --> 00:29:47,777
Come on. You can do it.

375
00:29:54,717 --> 00:29:57,827
What on earth are you doing?
Get this off me!

376
00:29:58,327 --> 00:30:01,557
I saw a big piece of trash,
so I thought I'd clean up.

377
00:30:01,926 --> 00:30:04,426
It's too big for the vacuum though.

378
00:30:06,227 --> 00:30:08,237
Let go!

379
00:30:09,436 --> 00:30:12,136
Wait, someone's calling.
That's what I call perfect timing.

380
00:30:12,136 --> 00:30:14,176
You and your darn strong arms.

381
00:30:15,106 --> 00:30:16,106
Hello?

382
00:30:16,837 --> 00:30:20,077
Are you kidding me?
You want me to work on a weekend?

383
00:30:20,077 --> 00:30:21,146
Are you drunk?

384
00:30:23,717 --> 00:30:24,747
Extra pay?

385
00:30:26,186 --> 00:30:28,287
It should be double on weekends.

386
00:30:28,757 --> 00:30:29,886
Of course.

387
00:30:31,757 --> 00:30:32,827
Mr. Dong,

388
00:30:33,186 --> 00:30:35,297
I can't get a hold of Chan Mi.

389
00:30:35,396 --> 00:30:37,997
She probably got wasted last night
and is now ghosting you.

390
00:30:37,997 --> 00:30:39,626
Call her until
her phone battery dies.

391
00:30:40,096 --> 00:30:41,636
(Congratulations on
returning to the field)

392
00:30:41,636 --> 00:30:44,237
Where else would I be?
I'm in Nonhyeon-dong.

393
00:30:46,106 --> 00:30:47,166
Exactly.

394
00:30:47,537 --> 00:30:50,077
Why would I be here
on a weekend morning?

395
00:30:51,646 --> 00:30:54,077
It's because Royal Hotel is here.

396
00:30:55,017 --> 00:30:58,846
Auntie, I said I didn't have
the time for this.

397
00:31:00,446 --> 00:31:02,557
What do you mean you want a photo?

398
00:31:02,817 --> 00:31:04,856
Of course I'm in a skirt.

399
00:31:05,987 --> 00:31:07,727
Yes, I'm wearing makeup too.

400
00:31:07,727 --> 00:31:09,557
Did you think I came here
without washing my face?

401
00:31:10,497 --> 00:31:12,227
Whatever. I'm hanging up.

402
00:31:12,866 --> 00:31:13,866
Sure.

403
00:31:43,227 --> 00:31:44,727
Look at you getting your hopes up.

404
00:31:44,727 --> 00:31:47,497
This is how you get
a bomb blasted on your head.

405
00:31:47,497 --> 00:31:49,737
(Congratulations on
returning to the field)

406
00:32:13,926 --> 00:32:15,227
It's the weekend,

407
00:32:15,396 --> 00:32:17,967
so finding a babysitter
won't be easy.

408
00:32:22,537 --> 00:32:23,537
Don't spit it out.

409
00:32:23,537 --> 00:32:25,706
I made this just for you, you know.

410
00:32:27,807 --> 00:32:28,837
Right.

411
00:32:29,106 --> 00:32:31,247
Which hotel in Nonhyeon-dong?

412
00:32:31,777 --> 00:32:33,146
Royal Hotel?

413
00:32:34,116 --> 00:32:35,446
Yes, I know the place.

414
00:32:48,856 --> 00:32:49,896
(Wash and Clean)

415
00:32:52,467 --> 00:32:53,797
Ok Cheol is here.

416
00:32:56,337 --> 00:32:58,807
Il Kwang?

417
00:32:58,967 --> 00:33:00,007
That's right.

418
00:33:02,537 --> 00:33:04,346
Il Kwang...

419
00:33:04,807 --> 00:33:06,577
is Korea's most prominent company.

420
00:33:07,517 --> 00:33:08,646
It's admirable.

421
00:33:08,646 --> 00:33:10,547
You're the one
who's more impressive.

422
00:33:10,547 --> 00:33:12,217
One would have to be passionate...

423
00:33:12,217 --> 00:33:13,846
to get injured in the line of work.

424
00:33:15,587 --> 00:33:17,926
Here you go.

425
00:33:29,436 --> 00:33:30,706
I see...

426
00:33:32,406 --> 00:33:34,106
you're good with knives.

427
00:33:34,206 --> 00:33:35,936
Well, this is nothing...

428
00:33:35,936 --> 00:33:37,547
compared to my cooking skills.

429
00:33:37,747 --> 00:33:39,176
I'd love to show you next time.

430
00:33:39,176 --> 00:33:41,477
I'll make you a tender chop steak.

431
00:33:44,386 --> 00:33:46,116
Next time?

432
00:33:50,416 --> 00:33:51,487
Well,

433
00:33:51,656 --> 00:33:54,027
Il Kwang has over 30 subsidiaries,

434
00:33:54,497 --> 00:33:55,827
so I shouldn't worry.

435
00:33:56,227 --> 00:33:59,166
So what is it
that you do for a living?

436
00:34:01,037 --> 00:34:02,037
I...

437
00:34:03,067 --> 00:34:05,706
work at a small company...

438
00:34:06,007 --> 00:34:07,267
in overseas marketing...

439
00:34:08,636 --> 00:34:11,946
I see.
You work in overseas transactions.

440
00:34:13,606 --> 00:34:15,777
Yes, something like that.

441
00:34:17,146 --> 00:34:18,317
(Team Leader Dong)

442
00:34:22,817 --> 00:34:24,016
Excuse me.

443
00:34:24,757 --> 00:34:28,097
The person you have reached
can't talk due to...

444
00:34:28,097 --> 00:34:29,496
the business she's engaged in.

445
00:34:29,657 --> 00:34:33,797
If you call again, she might
turn off her phone altogether.

446
00:34:34,337 --> 00:34:36,266
Bye, see you tomorrow.

447
00:34:36,797 --> 00:34:38,206
What? Hey!

448
00:34:40,706 --> 00:34:41,837
Chan Mi!

449
00:34:42,106 --> 00:34:43,177
Unbelievable.

450
00:34:44,576 --> 00:34:46,007
That was JS.

451
00:34:46,007 --> 00:34:47,177
JS?

452
00:34:48,576 --> 00:34:49,617
The jerk-scumbag.

453
00:35:05,797 --> 00:35:07,197
Mi Soon, where are you?

454
00:35:07,197 --> 00:35:08,297
Get in there!

455
00:35:11,606 --> 00:35:13,166
I'm on my way.

456
00:35:13,166 --> 00:35:16,936
Let's greet my customer then.

457
00:35:22,416 --> 00:35:23,476
What's wrong with this?

458
00:35:34,826 --> 00:35:37,097
What on earth are you doing here?

459
00:35:37,797 --> 00:35:39,326
I could ask you the same thing.

460
00:35:39,996 --> 00:35:40,996
No way...

461
00:35:42,597 --> 00:35:43,666
No way.

462
00:35:45,007 --> 00:35:47,206
Why...

463
00:35:47,206 --> 00:35:49,337
What is she doing there?

464
00:35:54,416 --> 00:35:56,416
Chan Mi, how about
we go out for dessert?

465
00:35:58,347 --> 00:35:59,847
Can I take a rain check?

466
00:35:59,847 --> 00:36:02,556
I'm sorry,
but something urgent came up.

467
00:36:06,126 --> 00:36:07,826
You scumbag!

468
00:36:16,337 --> 00:36:17,367
Please don't go.

469
00:36:17,367 --> 00:36:19,806
What are you doing? Let go of me.

470
00:36:19,806 --> 00:36:21,576
Things are over between us.

471
00:36:21,677 --> 00:36:22,777
You should leave.

472
00:36:22,777 --> 00:36:24,646
We were together for seven years,

473
00:36:24,646 --> 00:36:27,376
but here you are on a blind date...

474
00:36:27,507 --> 00:36:29,117
days after we broke up.

475
00:36:29,217 --> 00:36:31,487
I thought you loved me.

476
00:36:31,487 --> 00:36:32,887
You said I was the one for you.

477
00:36:32,887 --> 00:36:34,286
What a scumbag.

478
00:36:34,786 --> 00:36:36,016
Do something.

479
00:36:38,157 --> 00:36:39,157
See this?

480
00:36:39,887 --> 00:36:43,597
I'm going to find another woman
and live a good life,

481
00:36:43,597 --> 00:36:45,697
so get over it already. Just leave.

482
00:36:46,226 --> 00:36:47,996
Don't put me in the middle of this.

483
00:36:47,996 --> 00:36:50,166
Go. Get out of my life.

484
00:36:51,306 --> 00:36:52,467
Is that Zo In Sung?

485
00:36:52,467 --> 00:36:53,507
Zo In Sung?

486
00:37:08,016 --> 00:37:09,117
What are you...

487
00:37:19,226 --> 00:37:21,036
What just happened?

488
00:37:22,967 --> 00:37:23,996
Zo In Sung?

489
00:37:28,137 --> 00:37:30,837
What on earth? Where did he go?

490
00:37:33,277 --> 00:37:35,246
Where is he?

491
00:37:35,876 --> 00:37:38,016
I really hoped
to find someone decent this time,

492
00:37:38,717 --> 00:37:40,746
but I guess I'm cursed
when it comes to men.

493
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:42,217
Sorry.

494
00:37:50,356 --> 00:37:51,367
Where did he go?

495
00:37:53,826 --> 00:37:54,867
What?

496
00:37:56,436 --> 00:37:57,436
Under the table?

497
00:37:58,266 --> 00:37:59,507
Sweetheart!

498
00:37:59,967 --> 00:38:01,876
My gosh.

499
00:38:02,177 --> 00:38:03,876
Are you all right?

500
00:38:03,876 --> 00:38:05,876
Open your eyes!

501
00:38:08,376 --> 00:38:10,376
You ignored my call, this operation,

502
00:38:10,376 --> 00:38:11,717
and my orders.

503
00:38:13,047 --> 00:38:14,246
What a proud moment for you.

504
00:38:14,887 --> 00:38:15,987
Did you see everything?

505
00:38:19,786 --> 00:38:23,097
A romantic thriller with a twist.

506
00:38:23,297 --> 00:38:26,297
How was
the entertaining blockbuster?

507
00:38:26,527 --> 00:38:28,567
It was more like a soap opera to me.

508
00:38:29,137 --> 00:38:30,197
Didn't you know?

509
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:32,507
Soap operas have
been trending lately.

510
00:38:36,106 --> 00:38:38,507
- Are you all right?
- I'm good.

511
00:38:38,507 --> 00:38:40,076
It serves you right.

512
00:38:43,076 --> 00:38:46,087
Ok Cheol isn't ordering
and is waiting for someone.

513
00:38:47,856 --> 00:38:49,257
- Hey, newbie.
- Yes?

514
00:38:49,257 --> 00:38:50,487
Want to try the new menu?

515
00:38:50,487 --> 00:38:51,556
The new menu?

516
00:38:52,387 --> 00:38:54,186
Sure. Why not?

517
00:38:55,496 --> 00:38:57,726
This must be my lucky day. Awesome.

518
00:38:59,967 --> 00:39:02,737
Gosh, it's very good.

519
00:39:23,856 --> 00:39:31,726
(Michael: NIS is on to you.
Will be in touch.)

520
00:39:39,606 --> 00:39:41,837
Ok Cheol is heading out.

521
00:39:46,007 --> 00:39:48,177
Seriously? Darn it.

522
00:39:50,246 --> 00:39:51,317
Goodness.

523
00:39:52,117 --> 00:39:54,117
- It's to die for.
- Mi Soon, get out here.

524
00:39:55,786 --> 00:39:57,387
Right now? Why?

525
00:39:57,617 --> 00:39:59,356
We're waiting outside, so move it.

526
00:40:03,826 --> 00:40:05,597
Thank you!

527
00:40:16,637 --> 00:40:17,847
What's taking you so long?

528
00:40:21,076 --> 00:40:22,347
Sorry about that.

529
00:40:22,347 --> 00:40:23,717
- Seriously?
- I said I was sorry.

530
00:40:23,817 --> 00:40:25,217
Mu Hyeok, follow him.

531
00:40:28,556 --> 00:40:30,117
(Wash and Clean)

532
00:40:35,797 --> 00:40:38,967
Wait, she's coming!

533
00:40:42,367 --> 00:40:44,367
- Faster.
- But...

534
00:40:44,396 --> 00:40:46,306
Run faster!

535
00:41:03,416 --> 00:41:04,527
Darn it.

536
00:41:12,527 --> 00:41:14,067
Mi Soon, hop in.

537
00:41:14,467 --> 00:41:15,697
You couldn't have stopped earlier?

538
00:41:15,896 --> 00:41:17,666
- Come on.
- Unbelievable.

539
00:41:18,137 --> 00:41:19,137
Get in.

540
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:21,536
Let's go.

541
00:41:27,007 --> 00:41:29,617
- Mr. Dong!
- Stop the van.

542
00:41:30,746 --> 00:41:32,347
What took you so long?

543
00:41:33,746 --> 00:41:34,786
Sorry about that.

544
00:41:34,956 --> 00:41:36,786
The cab took a wrong turn.

545
00:41:37,117 --> 00:41:39,126
- Just drive.
- Sure.

546
00:41:42,896 --> 00:41:45,726
You can't cut in line like that.

547
00:41:45,826 --> 00:41:46,927
Sorry.

548
00:41:48,597 --> 00:41:51,536
- Could you turn up the AC?
- Sure.

549
00:41:58,007 --> 00:41:59,076
There he is.

550
00:41:59,106 --> 00:42:00,476
Drive faster. We'll lose him.

551
00:42:01,447 --> 00:42:02,646
I want to,
but we have a kid on board.

552
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:04,786
I'm sorry.

553
00:42:05,016 --> 00:42:06,686
I just couldn't find a sitter.

554
00:42:07,717 --> 00:42:10,657
Ok Cheol seems to be heading...

555
00:42:11,016 --> 00:42:12,356
to the research lab.

556
00:42:13,286 --> 00:42:15,326
What on earth is he up to?

557
00:42:33,907 --> 00:42:39,217
(Michael: NIS is on to you.
Will be in touch.)

558
00:42:39,916 --> 00:42:42,087
Sir, can you go a little faster?

559
00:42:42,157 --> 00:42:43,587
Then I'd be going over the limit.

560
00:42:44,056 --> 00:42:45,456
Drive faster!

561
00:42:48,797 --> 00:42:49,956
Faster.

562
00:42:50,226 --> 00:42:51,427
What's up with him?

563
00:43:01,306 --> 00:43:03,576
Make a left to the research lab!

564
00:43:10,576 --> 00:43:13,717
After all that,
he's heading back to the lab?

565
00:43:13,916 --> 00:43:14,987
He made us.

566
00:43:15,186 --> 00:43:17,016
He probably did at the coffee shop.

567
00:43:17,087 --> 00:43:18,157
He's right.

568
00:43:20,456 --> 00:43:23,126
I won't deny that
I am partially to blame here.

569
00:43:23,126 --> 00:43:25,996
But would we have
failed this mission...

570
00:43:25,996 --> 00:43:26,996
if Mi Soon had come out faster?

571
00:43:27,297 --> 00:43:28,367
What?

572
00:43:28,797 --> 00:43:31,766
I'm the only one
who came to work on time.

573
00:43:31,766 --> 00:43:33,036
You've got to be kidding me.

574
00:43:33,036 --> 00:43:34,936
I came as fast I could too,

575
00:43:35,436 --> 00:43:38,576
but Mr. Dong summoned us
without much time to spare.

576
00:43:38,576 --> 00:43:39,806
- You're right.
- Exactly.

577
00:43:41,376 --> 00:43:43,177
So it's all my fault. Is that it?

578
00:43:46,646 --> 00:43:48,487
Forget the mission
if that's how it'll be.

579
00:43:49,916 --> 00:43:50,987
Pull over.

580
00:44:12,706 --> 00:44:13,777
Come on.

581
00:44:14,646 --> 00:44:15,646
Over there.

582
00:44:21,317 --> 00:44:23,617
I'm not asking you
to have world-class teamwork.

583
00:44:23,717 --> 00:44:26,087
I'm not even expecting
the best version of yourselves.

584
00:44:27,126 --> 00:44:29,556
Still, shouldn't you at least
do the basics?

585
00:44:30,996 --> 00:44:32,027
I'm sorry.

586
00:44:32,027 --> 00:44:34,867
We'll get Michael's number
from Ok Cheol, okay?

587
00:44:34,867 --> 00:44:36,067
I'd like to see you try.

588
00:44:36,896 --> 00:44:38,036
Do you think we can't do it?

589
00:44:38,337 --> 00:44:40,967
Because we don't know the basics?
We're not even up to par?

590
00:44:42,137 --> 00:44:43,206
Hold on a second.

591
00:44:43,206 --> 00:44:44,777
We just need to
get Ok Cheol's phone...

592
00:44:44,947 --> 00:44:47,206
and find Michael's number on it.

593
00:44:47,306 --> 00:44:48,476
Easier said than done.

594
00:44:48,476 --> 00:44:50,777
How will you possibly
get your hands on his phone?

595
00:44:50,976 --> 00:44:52,916
We'll swipe it, of course.

596
00:44:52,916 --> 00:44:54,047
It'll take three seconds tops.

597
00:44:54,146 --> 00:44:55,416
Mi Soon, please.

598
00:44:55,516 --> 00:44:57,356
Ever since the beginning
of phase three,

599
00:44:57,356 --> 00:44:59,487
he rarely leaves the research lab.

600
00:44:59,956 --> 00:45:02,197
This was his first outing in a week.

601
00:45:03,226 --> 00:45:05,967
Then we'll have to infiltrate
the research lab.

602
00:45:05,967 --> 00:45:08,396
But another security system error...

603
00:45:08,496 --> 00:45:09,637
will raise flags.

604
00:45:09,637 --> 00:45:10,697
She's right.

605
00:45:10,697 --> 00:45:12,407
Remember the one that glared at us?

606
00:45:12,407 --> 00:45:14,137
He might catch on.

607
00:45:15,076 --> 00:45:16,106
Really?

608
00:45:16,576 --> 00:45:18,547
Your hard work paid off though...

609
00:45:19,547 --> 00:45:22,177
because we now have a way in.

610
00:45:24,947 --> 00:45:25,987
Time out.

611
00:45:27,087 --> 00:45:30,016
Are you talking about
what I think you're talking about?

612
00:45:31,487 --> 00:45:32,657
Hello?

613
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:36,197
Can you curl up a bit more?

614
00:45:39,867 --> 00:45:40,967
No way.

615
00:45:41,597 --> 00:45:43,036
My word is final.

616
00:45:43,166 --> 00:45:45,936
I'm not going in there again. Never.

617
00:45:50,436 --> 00:45:51,447
No.

618
00:45:52,876 --> 00:45:53,876
No way.

619
00:46:05,056 --> 00:46:06,126
Why must it be me?

620
00:46:06,456 --> 00:46:07,786
You suggested the infiltration.

621
00:46:07,987 --> 00:46:10,226
You said we should
head in there ourselves.

622
00:46:11,126 --> 00:46:12,626
(Congratulations on
returning to the field)

623
00:46:13,867 --> 00:46:15,967
Why am I the one
who always does these things?

624
00:46:16,067 --> 00:46:19,106
Why? Why me?

625
00:46:19,467 --> 00:46:21,737
Why do you always do this to me?

626
00:46:22,007 --> 00:46:24,306
Why? Just why?

627
00:46:24,536 --> 00:46:25,847
Forget it. I'm going home.

628
00:46:26,277 --> 00:46:27,476
Drive.

629
00:46:32,286 --> 00:46:33,317
Mi Soon.

630
00:46:35,087 --> 00:46:38,257
I thought these tights
might help in there.

631
00:46:38,356 --> 00:46:40,657
Either you take my place
or get that out of my sight.

632
00:46:44,097 --> 00:46:47,396
Mi Soon, we'll be watching
from outside,

633
00:46:47,396 --> 00:46:48,396
so don't be scared.

634
00:46:48,896 --> 00:46:50,436
Activate Code Blue
if you're in trouble.

635
00:46:50,436 --> 00:46:53,367
Either you take my place
or shut your trap.

636
00:47:27,067 --> 00:47:29,706
This is a blind spot,
so no cameras will see you.

637
00:47:30,306 --> 00:47:32,507
The parking lot never has
too many guards either.

638
00:47:32,547 --> 00:47:34,576
Either you take my place...

639
00:47:36,317 --> 00:47:37,376
or get lost.

640
00:47:37,746 --> 00:47:40,117
Sure. I'll get lost.

641
00:47:40,987 --> 00:47:42,087
A big sidestep.

642
00:47:47,757 --> 00:47:49,726
Mi Soon, be careful.

643
00:48:15,516 --> 00:48:16,516
What the...

644
00:48:21,797 --> 00:48:22,797
Gosh.

645
00:48:25,467 --> 00:48:26,496
Let's go.

646
00:48:47,947 --> 00:48:49,016
That's it.

647
00:48:57,556 --> 00:48:59,896
Okay.

648
00:49:09,536 --> 00:49:10,606
She's in.

649
00:49:11,337 --> 00:49:12,976
She's in. Get ready.

650
00:49:13,047 --> 00:49:14,047
Yes, sir.

651
00:49:26,427 --> 00:49:27,527
I can't believe...

652
00:49:29,427 --> 00:49:31,197
I'm back in here.

653
00:50:21,146 --> 00:50:22,277
What on earth?

654
00:50:24,217 --> 00:50:25,416
Unbelievable.

655
00:50:26,547 --> 00:50:28,516
I'll probably die
from a lung disease first.

656
00:50:51,677 --> 00:50:53,007
It could be dangerous.

657
00:50:53,476 --> 00:50:54,847
If things go south and we die,

658
00:50:55,617 --> 00:50:57,047
then I'll be happy
not to have died alone.

659
00:51:48,737 --> 00:51:49,967
My gosh.

660
00:51:51,166 --> 00:51:52,237
Why did he have to scream?

661
00:51:52,436 --> 00:51:53,606
Mr. Ok!

662
00:51:54,837 --> 00:51:56,436
Are you all right?

663
00:51:58,436 --> 00:52:00,047
Up there.

664
00:52:00,047 --> 00:52:03,217
- Up there. I saw something.
- Up there?

665
00:52:05,487 --> 00:52:06,516
There...

666
00:52:06,786 --> 00:52:08,757
I'm sorry, but nothing's there.

667
00:52:11,717 --> 00:52:14,456
- Nothing?
- Yes, there's nothing there.

668
00:52:15,056 --> 00:52:16,297
Absolutely nothing.

669
00:52:29,507 --> 00:52:31,337
It's up there.

670
00:52:31,337 --> 00:52:32,476
I definitely saw it.

671
00:52:32,476 --> 00:52:34,576
My gosh!

672
00:52:42,617 --> 00:52:45,856
I killed him.

673
00:52:46,286 --> 00:52:47,427
It's because of me...

674
00:52:49,027 --> 00:52:50,826
I killed him.

675
00:52:52,427 --> 00:52:54,826
Mr. Ok, you should take a break.

676
00:52:54,826 --> 00:52:58,436
No, this can't be.

677
00:52:58,436 --> 00:52:59,867
No...

678
00:53:33,067 --> 00:53:34,067
All right.

679
00:53:50,587 --> 00:53:51,987
Are you all right, sir?

680
00:53:52,326 --> 00:53:53,356
Yes.

681
00:53:55,626 --> 00:53:56,697
I'm sorry...

682
00:53:57,326 --> 00:53:58,356
about before.

683
00:53:58,356 --> 00:53:59,697
Don't mention it.

684
00:53:59,896 --> 00:54:02,467
For a moment, I thought
you had seen the bouncing head.

685
00:54:02,697 --> 00:54:03,867
The bouncing head?

686
00:54:03,867 --> 00:54:04,936
Didn't you know?

687
00:54:04,936 --> 00:54:07,106
This research lab
used to be a mental institution.

688
00:54:08,266 --> 00:54:09,306
I didn't know.

689
00:54:10,536 --> 00:54:11,576
I had no idea.

690
00:54:12,606 --> 00:54:14,947
It obviously looks like a hospital.

691
00:54:15,206 --> 00:54:17,246
All square and white.

692
00:54:17,717 --> 00:54:20,447
I heard that many of the patients...

693
00:54:20,447 --> 00:54:21,847
were incarcerated
against their will.

694
00:54:32,266 --> 00:54:34,726
What's wrong with you?

695
00:54:35,226 --> 00:54:36,867
Pick up the pace!

696
00:54:36,867 --> 00:54:38,806
Get it done already.

697
00:54:38,806 --> 00:54:40,266
Come on.

698
00:54:40,706 --> 00:54:42,206
Okay, good.

699
00:54:42,206 --> 00:54:45,237
Here we go. Keep going.

700
00:54:46,277 --> 00:54:48,717
A fire broke out though...

701
00:54:48,916 --> 00:54:50,677
and all the patients...

702
00:54:50,677 --> 00:54:53,347
got trapped and burned alive.

703
00:54:53,987 --> 00:54:56,856
Later on, they found a patient
at the front entrance.

704
00:54:56,856 --> 00:54:59,286
He had died with his head stuck...

705
00:54:59,626 --> 00:55:00,856
in the bars of the window.

706
00:55:02,097 --> 00:55:03,126
The bouncing head?

707
00:55:09,597 --> 00:55:10,637
What I saw...

708
00:55:12,766 --> 00:55:14,606
wasn't the face of a human.

709
00:55:18,237 --> 00:55:20,047
You're almost done.

710
00:55:20,947 --> 00:55:22,947
You're almost done.

711
00:55:24,476 --> 00:55:26,717
There is no such thing
as ghosts though.

712
00:55:28,047 --> 00:55:30,686
- Don't be silly, sir.
- I'm not kidding.

713
00:55:39,027 --> 00:55:40,797
Unbelievable.

714
00:55:41,496 --> 00:55:44,266
Just get in here, sir.

715
00:55:44,436 --> 00:55:46,306
Look. There's no one there.

716
00:55:48,536 --> 00:55:49,606
Right?

717
00:55:50,076 --> 00:55:52,746
I'm sure it's just a story
the employees made up.

718
00:55:52,907 --> 00:55:54,507
There is no such thing as ghosts.

719
00:55:55,416 --> 00:55:56,447
Of course.

720
00:55:57,047 --> 00:55:58,217
I'll get back to work then.

721
00:55:58,217 --> 00:55:59,217
Hold on.

722
00:56:05,726 --> 00:56:06,726
All right.

723
00:56:11,097 --> 00:56:14,726
In the name of the Lord,
in the name of the Lord

724
00:56:14,726 --> 00:56:18,067
We prevailed

725
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:21,606
In the name of the Lord,
in the name of the Lord

726
00:56:21,606 --> 00:56:25,206
We prevailed

727
00:56:25,646 --> 00:56:29,876
Amen

728
00:56:40,056 --> 00:56:41,056
You.

729
00:56:43,597 --> 00:56:44,626
You there!

730
00:56:56,706 --> 00:56:58,137
This is killing me.

731
00:57:01,206 --> 00:57:02,447
What now?

732
00:57:03,047 --> 00:57:04,117
Gosh.

733
00:57:04,976 --> 00:57:06,547
Are you kidding me?

734
00:57:29,306 --> 00:57:30,376
Mr. Ok!

735
00:57:31,306 --> 00:57:32,376
Mr. Ok!

736
00:57:37,376 --> 00:57:39,847
- What's up with him?
- Hello? Is this 911?

737
00:57:40,117 --> 00:57:41,217
- My boss passed out.
- Gosh.

738
00:57:49,297 --> 00:57:50,326
Hold on.

739
00:57:51,326 --> 00:57:52,567
What happened to your face?

740
00:57:52,567 --> 00:57:53,597
What about it?

741
00:57:54,126 --> 00:57:56,637
- What's this?
- Did I get something on it?

742
00:57:56,896 --> 00:57:58,496
Are you sure it went smoothly?

743
00:57:58,496 --> 00:58:00,606
Of course.

744
00:58:00,907 --> 00:58:03,876
Not even the spirits knew
that I was there.

745
00:58:05,576 --> 00:58:07,106
I have access to Ok Cheol's phone.

746
00:58:08,306 --> 00:58:11,547
All I need to do
is find Michael's contact number.

747
00:58:11,547 --> 00:58:12,987
(Michael)

748
00:58:13,246 --> 00:58:15,487
- What?
- You have it already?

749
00:58:15,717 --> 00:58:17,056
It's on speed dial.

750
00:58:17,056 --> 00:58:18,087
(Michael)

751
00:58:18,087 --> 00:58:19,987
Michael. That's him, right?

752
00:58:33,166 --> 00:58:35,637
Mounted stress and fatigue...

753
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:37,007
can weaken a person...

754
00:58:37,277 --> 00:58:39,047
which can also lead
to losing consciousness.

755
00:58:39,047 --> 00:58:40,746
There's nothing
to worry about though.

756
00:58:43,146 --> 00:58:44,916
I just thought it was
because of something I said.

757
00:58:45,146 --> 00:58:46,246
Thank you, doctor.

758
00:58:50,257 --> 00:58:52,326
(Michael)

759
00:58:57,797 --> 00:58:58,927
The phone is turned on.

760
00:58:58,927 --> 00:58:59,996
Trace its location.

761
00:59:01,567 --> 00:59:02,797
I need a trace...

762
00:59:02,797 --> 00:59:04,436
on the number I sent you ASAP.

763
00:59:18,987 --> 00:59:25,456
(NIS Chief Seo Gook Hwan)

764
00:59:33,396 --> 00:59:36,496
(This afternoon, 1 p.m.,
the cafe in Royal Hotel)

765
00:59:47,976 --> 00:59:51,117
(NIS is on to you.
Will be in touch.)

766
01:00:00,186 --> 01:00:03,626
(NIS Chief Seo Gook Hwan)

767
01:00:51,177 --> 01:00:53,007
(Epilogue)

768
01:00:54,277 --> 01:00:56,376
I should've eaten more for dinner.

769
01:00:59,186 --> 01:01:00,317
Gosh.

770
01:01:22,376 --> 01:01:23,376
Gosh.

771
01:01:25,376 --> 01:01:26,706
It's gotten all dirty.

772
01:02:45,387 --> 01:02:47,456
Are you all right?
Is your neck okay?

773
01:02:47,726 --> 01:02:49,657
Did you just hit me?

774
01:02:49,657 --> 01:02:51,126
No, I didn't...

775
01:02:51,126 --> 01:02:53,666
I wanted to sort out a few files,

776
01:02:53,666 --> 01:02:55,427
but you were...

777
01:02:55,567 --> 01:02:57,867
You were dozing off,

778
01:02:57,867 --> 01:03:01,166
so I put a blanket over you...

779
01:03:01,706 --> 01:03:03,507
This is why you should...

780
01:03:03,507 --> 01:03:06,606
call it a day
and go home if you're tired!

781
01:03:06,606 --> 01:03:08,146
Unbelievable.

782
01:03:24,996 --> 01:03:26,666
(Good Casting)

783
01:03:26,996 --> 01:03:28,927
Do you think Ok Cheol
found out about the cameras?

784
01:03:28,927 --> 01:03:30,867
I want a report
on Baek Chan Mi's whereabouts...

785
01:03:30,867 --> 01:03:31,936
off the record.

786
01:03:31,936 --> 01:03:34,567
Who should I arrest first? Bingo.

787
01:03:34,567 --> 01:03:35,606
Who sent you?

788
01:03:35,606 --> 01:03:36,976
Are Kang Woo Won's memories back?

789
01:03:37,036 --> 01:03:38,036
I don't know.

790
01:03:38,706 --> 01:03:40,576
I'll drive today.
I'm quite a skilled driver.

791
01:03:41,407 --> 01:03:43,047
- Don't swerve!
- Are we being informal now?

792
01:03:43,047 --> 01:03:44,976
Eyes on the road.
Your father passed away?

793
01:03:44,976 --> 01:03:46,547
I still don't get
why he went to Busan alone...

794
01:03:46,547 --> 01:03:47,947
three years ago.

795
01:03:47,947 --> 01:03:49,047
Show me how to use the rice cooker.

796
01:03:49,047 --> 01:03:50,257
Are you kidding me?

797
01:03:50,257 --> 01:03:52,587
This isn't where I should be today.

798
01:03:52,587 --> 01:03:54,056
Baek Chan Mi
isn't your average agent.

799
01:03:54,056 --> 01:03:56,226
If you're caught,
deal with her quietly.
