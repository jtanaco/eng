1
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:10,720
(Episode 29)

2
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:12,990
It's freezing.

3
00:00:13,129 --> 00:00:14,905
Can't I have my jacket back?

4
00:00:14,929 --> 00:00:17,029
No, I'm still freezing.

5
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:28,739
Is she gone?

6
00:00:32,149 --> 00:00:34,050
Yes, she's gone.

7
00:00:34,379 --> 00:00:36,820
What is this mess?

8
00:00:36,879 --> 00:00:38,565
I bet I'm the only forty-year-old...

9
00:00:38,589 --> 00:00:40,350
to get kicked out of the house
by his mom.

10
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:41,619
What did I even do wrong?

11
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,966
Let's not unnecessarily
point fingers.

12
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:45,536
You're to blame as well...

13
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,480
considering how you started
the train of divorce.

14
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,159
I'm sorry about all this.

15
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:53,130
Don't say that. We're all to blame.

16
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,775
We shouldn't have provoked Mom...

17
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:57,270
- Someone's coming!
- What?

18
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,009
What on earth?

19
00:01:06,609 --> 00:01:08,996
Why are the four of you
sitting out here?

20
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,079
- Dad!
- Dad!

21
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,920
My gosh.

22
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:15,420
Dad, my gosh.

23
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:21,560
Still, honey. You can't kick out
our grown-up kids.

24
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:23,459
The neighbors will talk.

25
00:01:23,659 --> 00:01:25,846
You kick them out
when you're angry too.

26
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:27,476
Why don't I get to do it?

27
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,900
I still let them put on their shoes.

28
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,269
Just look at the state they're in.

29
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:34,739
Why would I have gone this far?

30
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:37,950
What Yun Jeong said to me
on the street earlier...

31
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:43,519
How is it that no one
understands how I feel?

32
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,120
Anyway, I don't want
to hear another word.

33
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:47,650
I'm done with them all.

34
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:14,256
I didn't realize it the last time,
but it's quite spacious.

35
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,319
Where do I sleep?

36
00:02:15,849 --> 00:02:17,250
Just find a place.

37
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:20,265
The closet doesn't
seem like an option...

38
00:02:20,289 --> 00:02:22,590
and joining you in
the master bedroom...

39
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,319
is unimaginable.

40
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:27,560
I should just crash on the couch.

41
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:29,659
It's not bad. All right.

42
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,900
Gyu Jin, don't sigh.
You brought this on yourself.

43
00:02:36,099 --> 00:02:38,246
Why would you tell Mom about me?

44
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,686
I don't care how angry you were,

45
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:41,756
but that was careless of you.

46
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,780
You only added fuel to the flame.

47
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,750
You're happy to be
out of her house, aren't you?

48
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:50,280
"No" should be my answer,
but I can't lie.

49
00:02:52,189 --> 00:02:54,909
I would've said something sooner
if this was going to be the outcome.

50
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:57,635
I do feel bad for Mom,

51
00:02:57,659 --> 00:03:00,759
but saving myself
seems more important.

52
00:03:06,469 --> 00:03:07,699
This is comfortable.

53
00:03:14,909 --> 00:03:16,139
Darn it.

54
00:03:17,909 --> 00:03:19,726
What's wrong? Are you stuck?

55
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,526
Gosh, are you still awake?

56
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:24,120
Sorry, I'll keep it down.

57
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:28,566
What are you stuck on? Math?

58
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:31,759
Yes, you know it has never
been my best subject.

59
00:03:32,289 --> 00:03:35,235
The university I wish to get into
requires a math score,

60
00:03:35,259 --> 00:03:37,159
so it's as if
I'm back in high school.

61
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:39,729
All right. Let me see.

62
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,810
It's all right. You're upset anyway,
so I'll deal with this on my own.

63
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:48,139
I've interrupted
your studies enough.

64
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,139
Come on. Let me help.

65
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,379
What? You?

66
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,650
You idiot. How is the answer "one"?

67
00:03:59,389 --> 00:04:01,389
Is it zero then?

68
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,060
Or minus one?

69
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,105
This must be a joke.

70
00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:07,006
Just guess instead.

71
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,476
I'll make some dice
out of your eraser for you.

72
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:12,175
My eraser? Right, my eraser.

73
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:16,246
I was just saying that.
It's not like I meant it.

74
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:19,145
You can't distinguish jokes
or even solve math problems.

75
00:04:19,169 --> 00:04:21,039
Take a look at this.

76
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,779
All right. Where are you stuck on?

77
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:28,079
Well... Right here.

78
00:04:30,379 --> 00:04:33,519
Hey, this is one of
the basic concepts.

79
00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:35,665
You can't go on like this.

80
00:04:35,689 --> 00:04:38,089
I'll help you study
at least an hour a day.

81
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:39,459
Every day?

82
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,699
Gosh, I'd be thrilled
to have a private tutor.

83
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:47,300
How nice. I'm the luckiest.

84
00:04:48,139 --> 00:04:49,199
Focus.

85
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:54,879
How boring.
Slapstick comedy is so outdated.

86
00:05:00,009 --> 00:05:03,326
I feel bad for Mom,
but this is paradise.

87
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:04,350
This is awesome!

88
00:05:05,649 --> 00:05:06,689
Jae Seok,

89
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:10,696
you should clean up a little
after your shower.

90
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,290
There's soapy water everywhere.

91
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:14,829
Go and clean up.

92
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,730
Hold on. Stop snacking on the couch.

93
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,745
Do you know how hard it is
to get the crumbs out?

94
00:05:20,769 --> 00:05:21,815
Clean up right now.

95
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:23,870
Okay, fine. I'll clean up later.

96
00:05:24,269 --> 00:05:27,016
Not later. Do it now.
Get to it right away.

97
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,286
Fine, I will.

98
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:31,985
Get in there and clean up.

99
00:05:32,009 --> 00:05:33,180
Hurry.

100
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,896
There's no need to get violent,
you know.

101
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,995
I'd like to keep the peace too,
so clean up already.

102
00:05:39,019 --> 00:05:43,259
You're exhausting.
A man shouldn't be this nagging.

103
00:05:43,459 --> 00:05:46,889
I finally get why
Na Hee divorced you.

104
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,430
- You little...
- My gosh.

105
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:52,576
Hey. Clean up already!

106
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,206
Fine, I will!

107
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,839
Get to it right away.

108
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:59,170
I will. I'm getting to it now.

109
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,216
- See? I'm cleaning up.
- Clean up.

110
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,449
- Okay, I'll get to it later.
- Right now.

111
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:08,495
Clean up after yourself!

112
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:09,779
- Stop hitting me.
- Clean up!

113
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,990
Here you go.

114
00:06:14,019 --> 00:06:17,920
I hope the soup's not salty.
My taste buds have been off lately.

115
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,529
Gosh, Ms. Jang. It's delicious.

116
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:23,036
It's the best mallow soup
I've ever had.

117
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,776
He's right. It's truly delicious.

118
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,029
Really? I'm glad then.

119
00:06:28,129 --> 00:06:31,810
Why aren't you eating with us?
You should get a bite to eat.

120
00:06:32,769 --> 00:06:35,009
It's fine. I'll eat some later.

121
00:06:39,509 --> 00:06:42,750
I'll get going first.
Stay and finish your meals.

122
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,350
Sure.

123
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:53,889
They should've
buried the hatchet that day,

124
00:06:54,029 --> 00:06:56,276
- but that mean lady...
- Ga Hee, please.

125
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,406
What lady? Did something happen?

126
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:01,100
It's nothing.
Knowing will only upset you.

127
00:07:01,899 --> 00:07:04,216
That reminds me.
Aren't you filming something today?

128
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,069
Yes, we're getting
our headshots taken today.

129
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:10,079
Headshots?

130
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:14,110
Yes, it's to hand them out
to TV networks and film studios.

131
00:07:14,149 --> 00:07:17,726
We're thinking of a concept
that'll stick in people's minds.

132
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:20,949
So where are we taking these photos?
A studio in Gangnam?

133
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,029
Okay.

134
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:34,399
Awesome.

135
00:07:35,139 --> 00:07:37,576
Seo Young will touch these up later,

136
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,339
so this is more than good enough.

137
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:42,185
Let's take some of you guys now.
How about a test-shot?

138
00:07:42,209 --> 00:07:43,209
- Sure.
- Got it.

139
00:07:44,009 --> 00:07:45,050
Wait.

140
00:07:52,589 --> 00:07:53,689
What are you doing?

141
00:07:54,089 --> 00:07:55,995
We don't have the time. Now, get up.

142
00:07:56,019 --> 00:07:57,089
- Sure.
- Got it.

143
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:01,605
Look this way.
Smile for the first one.

144
00:08:01,629 --> 00:08:04,199
Here we go. Smile, guys.

145
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:11,199
This isn't right.

146
00:08:11,569 --> 00:08:13,209
How can you look
this scary while smiling?

147
00:08:14,139 --> 00:08:17,379
Let's start with
no expressions first.

148
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:18,910
Go ahead.

149
00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:22,726
Nice. This is way better.

150
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:26,550
Here we go. 1, 2, 3.

151
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:28,759
Okay, one more.

152
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:31,560
1, 2, 3.

153
00:08:32,889 --> 00:08:34,730
Awesome, guys.

154
00:08:41,529 --> 00:08:43,269
(Pediatrician Song Na Hee)

155
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,216
- Hello, doctor.
- Hi.

156
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,416
Dr. Yoon, can I get you some coffee?

157
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,679
It's fine. I'll get it myself.

158
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:55,120
Hasn't Dr. Song come to work yet?

159
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,779
I'm sure she has. Should I call her?

160
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,519
No, I can do that. Thanks.

161
00:09:06,529 --> 00:09:08,360
(Bo Young)

162
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,960
Hi, Bo Young.

163
00:09:13,299 --> 00:09:15,846
How's Si Hoo? Is he doing all right?

164
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,139
Yes, he's good.

165
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:19,686
You see,

166
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:23,610
I'm teaching a class
near your hospital later on.

167
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:24,940
Really?

168
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:27,179
You must be in high demand.

169
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:29,750
I really should swing by sometime.

170
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,350
You're always welcome here.

171
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,419
Could we perhaps...

172
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,759
meet up for lunch later?

173
00:09:38,929 --> 00:09:39,990
Lunch?

174
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:42,830
If I'm free too then...

175
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,799
Sorry, Bo Young.
We'll have lunch some other time.

176
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,870
Are you here for a beverage?

177
00:09:51,809 --> 00:09:53,009
Let me get it for you.

178
00:09:58,409 --> 00:09:59,549
Here.

179
00:10:01,779 --> 00:10:05,750
I'd like to apologize
for what happened yesterday.

180
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:08,320
My mom crossed the line.

181
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,059
Your mother has every right
to be angry.

182
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:15,529
It's fine.
My mom crossed the line too.

183
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,100
Should I...

184
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:22,976
call Mother personally
and apologize?

185
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,799
- That could ease...
- Why would you?

186
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:27,070
What?

187
00:10:27,769 --> 00:10:29,980
My mom isn't
your mother-in-law anymore...

188
00:10:31,009 --> 00:10:32,679
and you're no longer her son-in-law.

189
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:36,480
You calling her
won't appease her anger in any way.

190
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,879
It'll only provoke her.

191
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:42,559
Of course.

192
00:10:43,659 --> 00:10:44,960
I should've known better.

193
00:10:46,659 --> 00:10:47,929
We'll handle it separately.

194
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,299
I'll take care of my mom,
you take care of yours.

195
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,500
It won't be easy, but still.

196
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,669
Gosh.

197
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:04,480
Why are they together like that?

198
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:09,980
Guys, it's almost time
for the meeting.

199
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:15,120
We'll stick to what
we've been doing so far...

200
00:11:15,289 --> 00:11:19,029
and make decisions
on community outreach later.

201
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:21,336
- Got it.
- Sure.

202
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,460
Then let's wrap up today's meeting.

203
00:11:24,129 --> 00:11:28,740
By the way, should meetings
like this be held daily?

204
00:11:29,769 --> 00:11:31,785
Normally, it's on
Mondays and Fridays,

205
00:11:31,809 --> 00:11:33,940
but we meet up often
during presentation season.

206
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,586
I checked the logs...

207
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:38,679
and many meetings
didn't seem necessary.

208
00:11:39,049 --> 00:11:42,750
Notices can be sent out to you
in different ways, right?

209
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:46,090
How about we stick to
one meeting per week?

210
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:47,889
- Nice.
- Sounds good.

211
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,830
Let's be flexible
with when we gather too.

212
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:54,929
We could meet briefly
before the afternoon shift.

213
00:11:55,029 --> 00:11:57,200
Or we could meet
before we get off work.

214
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:59,775
Ms. Sim, I'd like you
to check the schedule.

215
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:01,245
Okay, I will.

216
00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:03,645
All right. That's all for today.

217
00:12:03,669 --> 00:12:05,485
I hope you all will have a good day.

218
00:12:05,509 --> 00:12:07,940
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

219
00:12:09,539 --> 00:12:11,909
Gosh, Gyu Jin.
It took only 20 minutes.

220
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:14,285
I know.

221
00:12:14,309 --> 00:12:16,679
Dr. Song,
do you want to grab a coffee?

222
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:20,149
Good. As long as you pay.

223
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,350
Okay.

224
00:12:29,129 --> 00:12:30,200
Gosh, my head.

225
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:33,470
I finished a whole bottle of wine.

226
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,340
I wish I could detach my head
and have it sterilized.

227
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,210
Those punks.

228
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,649
Even if they call me,
I won't answer it.

229
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:53,019
You guys should try worrying
about me for a change.

230
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:03,659
Are they afraid to call me?

231
00:13:04,629 --> 00:13:06,570
Still, I'm sure
they are feeling antsy.

232
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:10,046
I bet they can't even concentrate
on their work...

233
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:11,940
leaving their old mom all alone.

234
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,509
All right.

235
00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:21,086
Yes, Director Lee.

236
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:24,025
Dr. Song. Did you have lunch yet?

237
00:13:24,049 --> 00:13:25,895
No. I was about to leave.

238
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:28,419
That's good. Will you eat with me?

239
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:30,090
I have no one to eat with.

240
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:32,605
I'd rather eat alone though.

241
00:13:32,629 --> 00:13:34,330
I don't want to eat alone.

242
00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:35,989
And I don't want to look
like an outcast.

243
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,600
Can't you help me with that,
Dr. Song?

244
00:13:48,509 --> 00:13:49,785
- What?
- Hey, listen.

245
00:13:49,809 --> 00:13:51,409
I sound just like Lee Sun Kyun.

246
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:54,080
This is the first order for today.

247
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:57,895
- The first order for today.
- The first order for today.

248
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:00,666
What are you guys doing?

249
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:02,320
You've got a plan.

250
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,690
- What was that?
- Gosh.

251
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,929
- Darn it.
- Hang on.

252
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:08,860
Can I have stir-fried spicy pork?

253
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:10,405
That's Pengsoo.

254
00:14:10,429 --> 00:14:14,570
- Peng-hi.
- Peng-hi.

255
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,909
- Aren't I good?
- What?

256
00:14:20,669 --> 00:14:24,039
They don't seem worried at all.
What are they so excited about?

257
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:28,279
Those punks.

258
00:14:28,649 --> 00:14:30,379
Those rascals.

259
00:14:32,549 --> 00:14:33,590
Gyu Jin.

260
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:36,820
About the new hospital director.
Isn't he great?

261
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,929
Maybe it's because he's young,

262
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:42,500
but he seems reasonable, smart,
and on the same page as us.

263
00:14:42,659 --> 00:14:45,730
Tell me about it.
I'm sorry to say this,

264
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:48,669
but a certain someone didn't listen
and kept repeating himself.

265
00:14:49,539 --> 00:14:51,875
Unlike the previous director
who used to torture us with words...

266
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:53,785
He's completely different.

267
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:57,340
I could see hearts
in the nurses' eyes.

268
00:14:58,539 --> 00:15:01,149
I guess my best years have gone.

269
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:04,019
Shut it and eat your meal.

270
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:08,289
- What's that?
- Hello.

271
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:11,389
- Hello.
- Are they best friends or what?

272
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:15,059
- I know.
- What? You're right.

273
00:15:15,659 --> 00:15:18,000
They seem quite close.

274
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:20,899
And they look good together.

275
00:15:22,769 --> 00:15:24,240
Hey.

276
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:26,440
You have afternoon appointments.

277
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:28,470
Just finish your meal.

278
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,379
Let's sit over there.

279
00:15:49,429 --> 00:15:50,735
Gosh, I feel better now.

280
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:53,070
So why did you cram your food
into your mouth like that?

281
00:15:54,629 --> 00:15:55,639
Gyu Jin.

282
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:58,515
Be honest with me.
You were bothered, weren't you?

283
00:15:58,539 --> 00:16:01,809
By the new director and Na Hee...
I mean Dr. Song.

284
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:03,679
I'm not bothered at all.

285
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,025
They were quite close
back in school too.

286
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,779
Is that true? Really?

287
00:16:09,549 --> 00:16:11,019
Sure. That's true.

288
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,490
Let's just say it is.

289
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:16,265
By the way, Na Hee...
I mean Dr. Song...

290
00:16:16,289 --> 00:16:17,796
seems to have chosen
the young director's connections...

291
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,529
instead of the old ones.

292
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:21,605
Can't I just call her Na Hee?

293
00:16:21,629 --> 00:16:23,330
I don't know. I don't even care.

294
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:25,899
Hey.

295
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:29,639
You didn't fold the blankets
on the sofa this morning.

296
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,070
And why did you not put away...

297
00:16:32,509 --> 00:16:34,416
the cereal bowl on the table?

298
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:37,240
Why are you talking about that
all of a sudden?

299
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:40,110
I told you before.

300
00:16:41,379 --> 00:16:42,696
I will kick you out if need be.

301
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,956
There you go again with the nagging.
Oh, whatever.

302
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,889
- I can't hear you.
- Listen carefully.

303
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,495
If you keep acting like this,
you can't live with me.

304
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,096
Gosh, what's wrong with you?

305
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,190
- I don't know.
- Jae Seok. Jae Seok!

306
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,330
Gosh, that silly...

307
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:10,110
So... Do you want more soup?

308
00:17:11,009 --> 00:17:12,180
It's okay.

309
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:15,750
Are you pressuring me to leave
because I'm done eating?

310
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:18,450
Gosh, no. That's not what I meant.

311
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:23,535
Business seems slow today.
It's usually very crowded.

312
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:25,319
That's because it's exam season.

313
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:30,700
I guess your customers are mostly
students and market vendors.

314
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:36,000
It must be nice to have
lots of regulars and pretty looks.

315
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,440
I'm so jealous.

316
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,245
Are you kidding me?

317
00:17:39,269 --> 00:17:41,216
We're the ones who are
jealous of you.

318
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,186
Me? Why?

319
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:45,880
You have a good environment
to work in.

320
00:17:46,309 --> 00:17:48,226
I mean the delivery guy.

321
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,920
Delivery? Are you talking
about Hyo Sin?

322
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,995
I guess his name is Hyo Sin.

323
00:17:53,019 --> 00:17:54,890
Even his name sounds handsome.

324
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:57,619
He's totally our type.

325
00:17:57,819 --> 00:17:59,866
We both like tall guys.

326
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:01,906
Height is what determines his style.

327
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:03,305
And we do care about looks too.

328
00:18:03,329 --> 00:18:05,505
I don't care for tall guys
with ugly faces.

329
00:18:05,529 --> 00:18:07,569
I easily get tired of them.

330
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,815
And I like taciturn guys.

331
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:11,339
That's the most important part.

332
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:15,470
Some guys are very talkative.
I just hate them.

333
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,926
So you don't like talkative guys.

334
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:21,255
- Of course we don't.
- Of course we don't.

335
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:23,049
- I hate them.
- They are the worst.

336
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:26,789
What about age?
Do you not care about a man's age?

337
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,265
I prefer guys
who are younger than me.

338
00:18:29,289 --> 00:18:30,795
I don't like old men.

339
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:33,059
Me neither. They stink.

340
00:18:33,789 --> 00:18:35,930
So does the delivery guy
not have a girlfriend?

341
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,299
I bet he does.

342
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:40,769
I don't know.
He doesn't seem to have one.

343
00:18:41,529 --> 00:18:43,345
Do you want me to look into it?

344
00:18:43,369 --> 00:18:45,916
- Can you do that?
- That would be great.

345
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:48,269
If he doesn't have a girlfriend,
I will seduce him.

346
00:18:50,309 --> 00:18:52,450
So you like guys like him.

347
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:55,750
You sweeties.

348
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:10,160
I'm just happy for you.
Let's laugh together.

349
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:12,670
Okay.

350
00:19:14,299 --> 00:19:16,000
She's funny.

351
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:21,369
Dream on, Chi Su.

352
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,339
It's not going to happen.

353
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,509
Stop wasting your time
and just come to me.

354
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,150
Cho Yeon, this way.

355
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:34,519
Any store would be just fine.

356
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:38,735
They make sesame oil with seeds
they get from their in-laws' farm.

357
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:40,136
So it's much more flavorful.

358
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,299
It's on a higher level
than imported ones.

359
00:19:43,059 --> 00:19:45,930
Ma'am, she will take some
Korean sesame oil.

360
00:19:46,029 --> 00:19:47,305
2 bottles? Or 3?

361
00:19:47,329 --> 00:19:48,799
I will stock up on some.

362
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,345
- I'll have three bottles.
- Okay.

363
00:19:50,369 --> 00:19:52,970
- How much is it for a bottle?
- It's 20 dollars.

364
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,956
It's 60 dollars for 3 bottles.

365
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:58,755
Why is it so expensive?
Just take 55 dollars.

366
00:19:58,779 --> 00:20:00,809
What are you talking about?

367
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,325
That wouldn't even pay
for the bottles.

368
00:20:03,349 --> 00:20:04,656
That can't be right.

369
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,926
We're not just any old customer.

370
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:08,166
Will you be like that to members
of the merchant association?

371
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:09,920
Please stop it.

372
00:20:10,089 --> 00:20:11,519
She should make some profit too.

373
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:14,559
- Here's 60 dollars.
- Thank you.

374
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:18,059
All right then. Give her...

375
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:20,876
some sesame seeds then.

376
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:23,170
Okay. I'll do that.

377
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,039
Happy now?

378
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,745
Honey, get her three bottles
of sesame oil.

379
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:31,509
See? It's good to have me around.

380
00:20:32,309 --> 00:20:35,696
You should buy me sundaeguk today.

381
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,896
Okay. I will.

382
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,956
I will buy you sundaeguk,

383
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:40,950
so stop trying to act cute.
It isn't working.

384
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,119
I guess you like it.

385
00:20:44,089 --> 00:20:47,406
You seem to like it a lot.

386
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:49,500
I said stop. I hate it.

387
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:50,900
Okay.

388
00:20:54,369 --> 00:20:56,775
What was that? You startled me.

389
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:59,309
You're so naughty.

390
00:20:59,769 --> 00:21:00,916
I'm upset.

391
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,069
Don't be upset.

392
00:21:03,509 --> 00:21:04,539
You're funny.

393
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:11,480
Where's Hyo Sin?

394
00:21:11,779 --> 00:21:13,495
Is he out on a delivery?

395
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:14,990
- Yes. Why?
- What?

396
00:21:15,289 --> 00:21:18,490
I just have a few
questions to ask him.

397
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:24,630
Hyo Sin doesn't seem
to have a girlfriend, right?

398
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,045
I'm sure he finished high school.

399
00:21:27,069 --> 00:21:28,845
Do you think he Is
from the countryside?

400
00:21:28,869 --> 00:21:31,275
I don't know.
He rarely talks about himself.

401
00:21:31,299 --> 00:21:32,845
I know.

402
00:21:32,869 --> 00:21:35,515
Even a ghost wouldn't know what he's
up to if he doesn't say anything.

403
00:21:35,539 --> 00:21:37,156
It's been a while
since he joined us,

404
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:40,285
but we don't know
much about Hyo Sin.

405
00:21:40,309 --> 00:21:42,009
Forget about it.

406
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,426
Don't even try
prying into his affairs.

407
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:47,150
Why not? I'm just doing it
because I care about him.

408
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:50,065
I bet he doesn't talk
about himself for a reason.

409
00:21:50,089 --> 00:21:52,089
Just don't ask him, okay?

410
00:21:52,859 --> 00:21:53,990
Okay.

411
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:57,775
But what reason?
Do you know something?

412
00:21:57,799 --> 00:22:00,670
- Oh, come on.
- Oh, come on. Come on.

413
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,299
Enjoy the food.

414
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:14,849
(Yuyoung Judo)

415
00:22:23,859 --> 00:22:24,890
Park Hyo Sin?

416
00:22:27,289 --> 00:22:28,490
You're Hyo Sin, aren't you?

417
00:22:30,029 --> 00:22:31,299
My goodness.

418
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,200
How are you?

419
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,410
We haven't met in a while
and this is all I can offer.

420
00:22:39,869 --> 00:22:41,509
It's fine. Thank you.

421
00:22:42,539 --> 00:22:45,609
I coached judo for a few years
at a countryside high school.

422
00:22:46,579 --> 00:22:47,980
My wife's family lives nearby.

423
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:51,619
I opened this gym here
about three years ago.

424
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:53,750
What have you been up to?

425
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:56,859
I heard you quit.

426
00:22:57,519 --> 00:22:59,990
I just do whatever odd jobs I can.

427
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:02,160
I see.

428
00:23:03,529 --> 00:23:04,759
Did you quit...

429
00:23:06,069 --> 00:23:07,230
training altogether?

430
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:10,200
Yes.

431
00:23:10,769 --> 00:23:11,970
What a pity.

432
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,640
It's hard to find talent like you
in your weight class.

433
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,779
If it hadn't been for
that incident...

434
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:25,480
Come by whenever
you want to work out.

435
00:23:25,619 --> 00:23:28,849
You must be itching to train.
You don't have to pay.

436
00:23:31,059 --> 00:23:32,089
Okay.

437
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:35,730
You're leaving on time.

438
00:23:36,329 --> 00:23:38,329
Yes. My afternoon was pretty short.

439
00:23:39,029 --> 00:23:40,529
You're leaving early too.

440
00:23:41,269 --> 00:23:44,140
I have fewer patients now,
because of our scandal.

441
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,809
You must be pleased.
The new director seems to like you.

442
00:23:53,549 --> 00:23:54,710
Jeong Rok?

443
00:23:55,609 --> 00:23:56,920
We get along pretty well.

444
00:23:57,450 --> 00:23:59,690
I guess you do. It shows.

445
00:24:02,619 --> 00:24:04,535
Go ahead. I'm waiting for Jae Seok.

446
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:07,106
He stays with me now.
Mom kicked him out.

447
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:08,960
- See you tomorrow.
- Bye.

448
00:24:12,869 --> 00:24:15,575
As if you get along pretty well.

449
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:17,869
It must be great to have
a powerful backer.

450
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:21,769
What's taking him so long?

451
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,480
Darn him.

452
00:24:26,009 --> 00:24:27,686
Hello? Hey, Gyu Jin.

453
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:29,279
Why aren't you here yet?

454
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:32,825
You have to clean up
the mess you made this morning.

455
00:24:32,849 --> 00:24:36,420
Gyu Jin, I left work already.
Someone suddenly asked to meet.

456
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:39,606
I think I'll be home late.
See you at home later.

457
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:41,305
Drive safely.

458
00:24:41,329 --> 00:24:43,099
Hey. I'll kill you if you hang up.

459
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:46,000
Darn him! Darn him!

460
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,876
I thought I could breathe
if I got away from Mom,

461
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,740
but why is he even worse?

462
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,657
Good.

463
00:24:58,681 --> 00:25:01,049
Don't you think they look nice?

464
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:04,549
It's not nice at all.
It's so outdated, I can't stand it.

465
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:07,789
Why do they look so solemn?

466
00:25:08,049 --> 00:25:10,565
It looks like this was shot
before they were executed.

467
00:25:10,589 --> 00:25:13,390
And it shows that
you took it yourselves.

468
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:17,176
- Does it look that bad?
- Yes.

469
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,069
Why? I think it looks okay.
It's unique in its own way.

470
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:22,799
- "Unique"?
- "Unique"?

471
00:25:23,069 --> 00:25:24,170
"Unique"?

472
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,686
- Is that a good thing?
- I think so.

473
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:28,416
Really? You really think it's nice?

474
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,686
Yes, it's not too bad.

475
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:33,126
And Dad, you have me, don't you?

476
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:35,910
You know me. I've been a hardcore
GOT7 fan for three years.

477
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:38,720
Even the webmaster
waits for my work.

478
00:25:38,779 --> 00:25:41,490
Does that mean
she's good at tweaking photos?

479
00:25:42,089 --> 00:25:43,295
Watch this.

480
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:46,930
First, I add a filter
that brightens things up,

481
00:25:47,029 --> 00:25:49,289
then I accentuate your cheekbones.

482
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,906
A smaller face and taller body.

483
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:55,470
Then if I give you
broader shoulders...

484
00:25:55,829 --> 00:25:57,815
- Tada!
- My gosh!

485
00:25:57,839 --> 00:25:59,916
- Hey, is that really us?
- No way.

486
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:03,356
Let me see. Hey, this is fraud.

487
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:05,440
Ji Hun, isn't this too much?

488
00:26:05,579 --> 00:26:07,255
Even kids do this much nowadays.

489
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:08,450
- Really?
- Yes.

490
00:26:09,619 --> 00:26:12,525
Seo Young, do this with my photo.
I'd like a new profile picture.

491
00:26:12,549 --> 00:26:14,495
- Make my face smaller.
- Okay.

492
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:15,896
Even she can't make you look pretty.

493
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,196
What's so funny?

494
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,396
- You're home?
- Hi.

495
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:19,789
- Hello.
- Welcome home.

496
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:20,990
Look at this, Auntie.

497
00:26:21,029 --> 00:26:23,329
I worked wonders
on Dad's profile picture.

498
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:24,460
Wait.

499
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:27,299
Seo Young, shouldn't you be
in class right now?

500
00:26:28,529 --> 00:26:30,069
What? Well...

501
00:26:35,869 --> 00:26:36,940
I feel cold.

502
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:40,349
I feel like I'm coming down
with something.

503
00:26:40,779 --> 00:26:41,910
I have a headache.

504
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:44,849
Today, I have no choice
but to skip class.

505
00:26:45,619 --> 00:26:48,220
Really? Does your mom know?

506
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:50,619
Joon Seon, does she know?

507
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:53,706
No. I have to tell her.
I'll tell her later.

508
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:56,636
Joon Seon.
If your daughter is skipping class,

509
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,176
you should scold her.

510
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,245
Why are you hanging out with her?

511
00:27:00,269 --> 00:27:02,005
If the parents have
different approaches to education,

512
00:27:02,029 --> 00:27:03,799
the kid is bound to be confused.

513
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:06,539
- This is why Hyun Gyung...
- Na Hee.

514
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:09,009
What about dinner? Did you eat?

515
00:27:09,779 --> 00:27:11,985
Not yet. I'll get changed.

516
00:27:12,009 --> 00:27:13,049
Okay.

517
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:15,126
I told you to leave early.

518
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:17,950
I really didn't know
she'd come home early.

519
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:22,565
How does that brat
dare to lecture me?

520
00:27:22,589 --> 00:27:23,936
I have my own philosophy.

521
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,735
Dad. Is she going to
stay here forever?

522
00:27:26,759 --> 00:27:27,736
I feel uncomfortable.

523
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,866
So do I.

524
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:30,529
- Shall we go play in my room?
- Can we?

525
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:33,545
Seo Jin, shall we play in
the rooftop room? Yes?

526
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:34,706
Let's go.

527
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:35,769
Follow me.

528
00:27:48,849 --> 00:27:50,950
You used your elbow? Your elbow?

529
00:27:51,579 --> 00:27:54,490
Wait, wait. Time out. Time out.

530
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:55,950
This is unfair.

531
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,835
Didn't Seo Jin point at
Jong Soo and not me?

532
00:27:58,859 --> 00:28:00,005
She pointed at him.

533
00:28:00,029 --> 00:28:01,666
No, she pointed at you.
That's two penalties.

534
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:04,059
No, wait! Time out!

535
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:05,660
Sorry.

536
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:10,616
Seo Jin, earlier on,
did you point at him?

537
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,240
You did, right? Seo Jin, am I right?

538
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:15,285
Seo Jin, say something.

539
00:28:15,309 --> 00:28:18,779
You jerk.
How dare you say that to her?

540
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:21,426
- Are you out of your mind?
- Sorry. I'm really sorry.

541
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:22,995
Seo Jin, I'm really sorry.

542
00:28:23,019 --> 00:28:25,519
Seo Jin, they're so funny,
aren't they?

543
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:32,335
- Hyo Sin.
- Hi.

544
00:28:32,359 --> 00:28:34,406
Why are you back so late?

545
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:35,606
What time do you leave work?

546
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,106
Do you eat dinner elsewhere?

547
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:39,529
What do you like?
Snacks? Korean food?

548
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:43,116
Right. What's your number?
Can I have your number?

549
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,616
Song Seo Young. Leave.

550
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,616
Why? Things were just getting fun.

551
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,216
Leave. You have math class.

552
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,240
Mom will be angry if you miss that.

553
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,886
Earlier, you said
we could play together.

554
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:55,109
Go already.

555
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,390
I have to go, Hyo Sin.

556
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:04,936
I'll see you around.

557
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,706
No, you won't. Get out of here. Go!

558
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:08,930
Okay.

559
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:12,000
Is the game over?
With me getting beaten up?

560
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:13,970
Hey, you. Get out of the way.

561
00:29:24,609 --> 00:29:26,609
I was going to help her with math.

562
00:29:27,309 --> 00:29:28,950
Why isn't she back yet?

563
00:29:35,019 --> 00:29:36,960
- Hi, Na Hee.
- Where are you?

564
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:38,437
Why?

565
00:29:38,461 --> 00:29:40,606
I'm waiting to help you with math.

566
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:41,660
Where are you?

567
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:48,170
Right now, I'm still at the library.
The district library.

568
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,845
I'm being so efficient today that...

569
00:29:50,869 --> 00:29:52,269
I want to stay longer.

570
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:54,109
Until 10 p.m.

571
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:55,410
Is that so?

572
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,656
Okay. You should study when you can.

573
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,126
Good luck. Take care.

574
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:02,825
Okay. Don't wait up for me.

575
00:30:02,849 --> 00:30:06,119
You must be tired.
I feel really bad.

576
00:30:06,289 --> 00:30:07,289
Go to bed first.

577
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:10,619
Really, please don't wait up. Bye.

578
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,569
I'm starving.

579
00:30:28,109 --> 00:30:29,170
Mr. Yoon.

580
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:35,250
Mr. Yoon.

581
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,890
Ms. Song.

582
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:50,359
I feel much better now.

583
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,706
All my friends had other plans,

584
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:56,940
and I really didn't
want to eat alone.

585
00:30:57,839 --> 00:30:59,670
I was really hungry too.

586
00:31:01,509 --> 00:31:04,356
What are we both doing here
when we have homes to go to?

587
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,609
Exactly.

588
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:12,356
So, I stayed with Gyu Jin
for a few days...

589
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:15,549
and realized
your sister was a saint.

590
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:18,295
I've never met a man
who nags so much.

591
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:19,805
Gyu Jin is the worst.

592
00:31:19,829 --> 00:31:23,329
Don't say that when
you don't know the full truth.

593
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:28,529
You can't deal with my sister
unless you have a rock-solid will.

594
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:32,000
She's really gifted at
making people feel uncomfortable.

595
00:31:32,369 --> 00:31:35,716
Why do you think I'm wandering
instead of going home?

596
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:38,880
My gosh.
My brother even hit me, okay?

597
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:40,910
Na Hee doesn't resort to violence.

598
00:31:42,349 --> 00:31:43,380
Feel this.

599
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,450
Is that a bump? I felt another head.

600
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:52,220
She says she will teach me math
each night and...

601
00:31:53,029 --> 00:31:55,160
Do you finally get how she truly is?

602
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:59,029
I see those two
were perfect for each other.

603
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,345
Couldn't they just have
stayed together...

604
00:32:02,369 --> 00:32:05,976
instead of harassing
innocent civilians like us?

605
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,509
Tell me about it!

606
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:19,079
Shouldn't you
go to your mother though?

607
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:22,019
I walked by her cafe earlier
and it wasn't open.

608
00:32:22,589 --> 00:32:25,335
No way. I should stay clear
since she's still furious.

609
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:27,259
It's best to stay away for now.

610
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:28,490
Still,

611
00:32:28,789 --> 00:32:31,230
she gets lonely easily.

612
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:33,700
I'm sure she's waiting for you
to come home.

613
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,476
No way.

614
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,839
I bet I'm right.

615
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:39,740
She's too proud to call you first,

616
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,970
so stop by her place if you can.

617
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:45,686
Isn't it your job
to be a bridge between...

618
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:47,509
your mom and brother?

619
00:32:55,349 --> 00:32:56,490
Mom?

620
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:00,759
Where is she? Mom?

621
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:03,559
Mom?

622
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,259
What the...

623
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:11,116
Why on earth are you here, you punk?

624
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:12,575
Mom, what are you doing
on the floor?

625
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:14,285
You startled me.

626
00:33:14,309 --> 00:33:16,880
Shut it and leave.

627
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:21,126
I don't need any of you, so go!

628
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:23,279
How much did you have to drink?

629
00:33:23,819 --> 00:33:26,420
Your eyes are out of focus
and you're slurring your words.

630
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:29,750
Mind your own business!

631
00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:33,059
Darn you brats.

632
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:36,106
I saw that you've been...

633
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:39,759
having the time of your lives
after abandoning me.

634
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,906
You darn punks.

635
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:43,946
Did you come by the hospital? When?

636
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:45,269
Shut it!

637
00:33:46,369 --> 00:33:47,470
Leave.

638
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:50,539
- Get out. I'm done with you.
- Mom, wait.

639
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,216
- Leave!
- Fine, I will.

640
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,309
I will in just a second.

641
00:33:54,579 --> 00:33:57,755
Don't drink too much though.
You're only ruining your health.

642
00:33:57,779 --> 00:33:59,819
- Eat your meals instead.
- Shut it!

643
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,825
I don't want to hear any of it.

644
00:34:01,849 --> 00:34:03,420
Just leave, okay?

645
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:06,335
- Go!
- Fine, I'm going, aren't I?

646
00:34:06,359 --> 00:34:07,890
All right.

647
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,460
- I'm going.
- Go!

648
00:34:10,259 --> 00:34:11,329
Just leave.

649
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,400
What?

650
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:20,670
He isn't coming back?

651
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:25,480
I can't believe he actually left.

652
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,980
Can't he read between the lines?

653
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:32,880
This is what I get for
listening to Ms. Song.

654
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,349
She still hates my guts.

655
00:34:36,489 --> 00:34:38,236
I'm not comfortable
in my own house...

656
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:40,059
and Gyu Jin's isn't any better.

657
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:43,659
There is no place for me to rest.

658
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:46,869
I guess it boils down
to not having money.

659
00:34:52,769 --> 00:34:54,840
Mom's kimchi jjigae?

660
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:57,409
Even the smell of it is to die for.

661
00:34:58,409 --> 00:35:00,880
I love kimchi jjigae with pork.

662
00:35:01,309 --> 00:35:03,555
Just so you know,
I've gained some weight.

663
00:35:03,579 --> 00:35:05,195
It's all your fault.

664
00:35:05,219 --> 00:35:06,550
Me too.

665
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:08,626
You can blame me all you want,
so eat up.

666
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:11,190
Those doing physical activities
shouldn't eat poorly.

667
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,789
Hyo Sin, you should eat up too.

668
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,530
I'm already enjoying a lot.

669
00:35:14,659 --> 00:35:16,035
Ms. Jang, you should join us.

670
00:35:16,059 --> 00:35:18,336
He's right.
You should eat with us...

671
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,945
instead of eating alone.

672
00:35:19,969 --> 00:35:21,469
Yes, Mom, have a seat.

673
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:24,170
Mom, please have a seat.

674
00:35:25,469 --> 00:35:26,670
Come on.

675
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,780
Here's your coffee.

676
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:40,650
Ga Hee, let me take that.

677
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:42,989
You didn't have to
bring this up yourself.

678
00:35:43,719 --> 00:35:45,659
I was hoping to enjoy mine here too.

679
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,305
The tension between...

680
00:35:47,329 --> 00:35:49,429
Mom and Na Hee
could freeze up the whole house.

681
00:35:55,130 --> 00:35:57,070
- Thanks for the coffee.
- Thank you.

682
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:02,586
Joon Seon, have you healed from
the failed family dinner disaster?

683
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:06,340
Did you have to bring it up
when I've been trying to move on?

684
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:08,179
This is your biggest flaw.

685
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:11,380
You always try to catch both rabbits
when you need to make a choice.

686
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:15,095
Family or your career.
Sometimes you must choose one.

687
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:17,559
The director said
we'd be done by four.

688
00:36:17,659 --> 00:36:19,690
Those jerks at TV networks...

689
00:36:19,889 --> 00:36:22,566
act like they'll
keep their promises...

690
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:24,230
only to put us on the back-burner.

691
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,869
They couldn't care less
about our basic rights.

692
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,405
They're always in control.

693
00:36:28,429 --> 00:36:31,316
I won't ever work
with that director again.

694
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:32,646
I won't even if it's a big role.

695
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:36,409
I won't agree to it
even if my character has lines.

696
00:36:42,179 --> 00:36:43,320
Yes, Director.

697
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:45,980
Of course I got home in one piece.

698
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:49,349
A new project of yours?

699
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:53,760
What do you mean
by a significant role?

700
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:58,059
What? Of course, I'm on board.

701
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,345
I'll give it everything I have.

702
00:37:00,369 --> 00:37:02,976
Thank you so much.
Guys, say you're grateful.

703
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,345
- Thank you.
- Once more.

704
00:37:04,369 --> 00:37:05,416
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

705
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,086
Thank you so much.

706
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:09,510
Hold on a second.
Let me bow down to you.

707
00:37:09,739 --> 00:37:10,880
Guys, come on.

708
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:11,956
Please accept our bows.

709
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,210
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

710
00:37:21,669 --> 00:37:22,646
(Episode 30)

711
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:26,250
I know that I'm being
petty and childish.

712
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:27,750
I didn't say anything.

713
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,349
Yes, you were,
with that gaze of yours.

714
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:32,650
I don't want to be like this either.

715
00:37:32,779 --> 00:37:35,296
I know no one's
more upset than Na Hee,

716
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,989
but my anger flares up
every time I see her.

717
00:37:38,219 --> 00:37:39,196
Let's just get over there.

718
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:41,559
We need to divide zones
for today's general cleaning.

719
00:37:42,929 --> 00:37:46,576
I'm not in the mood for that.
Couldn't he postpone it?

720
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:49,399
Being the president's wife
doesn't have any benefits.

721
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,770
All I have is a dense husband.

722
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:54,509
Where should we go?

723
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:56,109
That place seems nice.

724
00:37:56,679 --> 00:37:58,479
- But it's...
- Good morning.

725
00:37:58,979 --> 00:38:00,055
- Hello.
- Hi.

726
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:01,555
Good morning, Director Lee.

727
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:04,396
Have you had coffee this morning?
If not, I'm willing to buy.

728
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:06,826
We already had ours.

729
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:09,090
We're grateful for the offer though.

730
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:11,835
I wanted to talk about
today's team dinner.

731
00:38:11,859 --> 00:38:13,536
We were talking about that too.

732
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:16,205
How about the galbi place
or the shabu-shabu restaurant?

733
00:38:16,229 --> 00:38:19,630
Wouldn't a buffet
be a better choice?

734
00:38:20,229 --> 00:38:22,915
Everyone likes different things...

735
00:38:22,939 --> 00:38:26,646
and Korean barbecue means grilling
which could be annoying.

736
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:28,545
We're totally on board,
Director Lee.

737
00:38:28,569 --> 00:38:31,055
Of course. It's the best ever!

738
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:33,750
So we'll go to a buffet
for our team dinner.

739
00:38:33,909 --> 00:38:36,150
I'll look for a decent place
we can go to.

740
00:38:36,849 --> 00:38:39,665
Also, it's not mandatory,

741
00:38:39,689 --> 00:38:42,519
so you may skip it
if you have other plans.

742
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:44,459
Okay? Good day, then.

743
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:49,135
My gosh. How can one be this smart?

744
00:38:49,159 --> 00:38:50,760
Doesn't he have a sweet voice too?

745
00:39:17,459 --> 00:39:18,495
Yes?

746
00:39:18,519 --> 00:39:19,866
I'm here to deliver a notice.

747
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:23,335
We're having a welcome dinner
for the new director at 6 p.m.

748
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:25,859
It's at a sushi buffet
and attendance isn't mandatory.

749
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,469
Will you be there, Na Hee...

750
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:30,370
I mean, Dr. Song.

751
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:34,415
Sure. It's not like I have
anyone at home waiting for me.

752
00:39:34,439 --> 00:39:36,680
Okay, so you'll be there.

753
00:39:36,979 --> 00:39:38,419
I have to make reservations,
you see.

754
00:39:40,409 --> 00:39:41,409
A team dinner?

755
00:39:42,479 --> 00:39:45,756
Why today? I have a research paper
I need to finish revising.

756
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:48,895
Just give me an answer.
Will you be there or not?

757
00:39:48,919 --> 00:39:51,165
I need to see who's attending
and make reservations.

758
00:39:51,189 --> 00:39:53,635
Is everyone else going?
You said attendance isn't mandatory.

759
00:39:53,659 --> 00:39:55,265
But everyone is going...

760
00:39:55,289 --> 00:39:56,699
including Na Hee...

761
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,599
I mean, Dr. Song.

762
00:39:59,629 --> 00:40:01,746
Anyway, I'll ask you one last time.

763
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:03,599
Will you be there or not?

764
00:40:04,469 --> 00:40:05,699
I'll be there.

765
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:08,039
I'll come back to this after dinner.

766
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:09,445
I still need to eat anyway, right?

767
00:40:09,469 --> 00:40:12,139
Okay, so everyone will be there.

768
00:40:12,509 --> 00:40:13,979
That reminds me.

769
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:16,310
I didn't tell you
because you were already asleep,

770
00:40:16,419 --> 00:40:18,395
but I went to see Mom
just to be kicked out again.

771
00:40:18,419 --> 00:40:20,150
She was totally drunk.

772
00:40:20,819 --> 00:40:21,919
Really?

773
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:37,240
What the... What on earth is that?

774
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:43,180
Gosh, my head.

775
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:45,639
What time is it?

776
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,966
Jae Seok probably told him,

777
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:55,719
but he still hasn't called.

778
00:40:56,050 --> 00:40:57,319
That brat.

779
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:03,229
Maybe I shouldn't have
kicked Jae Seok out last night.

780
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,129
Is it Jae Seok?

781
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:17,686
Yun Jeong, it's us. Open up.

782
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:19,355
It's us. Let us in.

783
00:41:19,379 --> 00:41:21,825
Why on earth are they here?

784
00:41:21,849 --> 00:41:23,650
How will they annoy me this time?

785
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:25,319
Unbelievable.

786
00:41:34,259 --> 00:41:35,306
Try some.

787
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:37,930
It's abalone porridge
from a store in Cheongdam-dong.

788
00:41:38,399 --> 00:41:40,899
Thanks. I'll enjoy it.

789
00:41:41,129 --> 00:41:43,199
We were shocked
to read the news article.

790
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:45,540
What on earth happened?

791
00:41:45,769 --> 00:41:47,540
I have no idea.

792
00:41:48,009 --> 00:41:50,480
I must've sinned in my past life.

793
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:55,910
This is why one must be cautious
when welcoming a daughter-in-law.

794
00:41:56,579 --> 00:41:59,550
Do you remember the girl that
I wanted to set Gyu Jin up with?

795
00:41:59,779 --> 00:42:01,050
The second daughter of CEO Min.

796
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:05,620
She married an accountant
and has been a devoted wife.

797
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:08,529
Her in-laws couldn't
adore her any more.

798
00:42:08,589 --> 00:42:10,029
They consider her their lucky charm.

799
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:13,870
That's something I regret too.

800
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:16,600
I should've never
approved this marriage.

801
00:42:16,839 --> 00:42:19,915
Do it right when it
comes to Jae Seok then.

802
00:42:19,939 --> 00:42:22,045
Jae Seok? That'll take a while.

803
00:42:22,069 --> 00:42:23,680
He just got back to Korea...

804
00:42:23,709 --> 00:42:25,315
and he doesn't seem interested
in marriage yet.

805
00:42:25,339 --> 00:42:27,250
Do you want to be
stabbed in the back again?

806
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:30,625
Just set him up with women
when you can.

807
00:42:30,649 --> 00:42:31,720
On a blind date?

808
00:42:31,819 --> 00:42:34,589
As if that idiot
would ever go on a blind date.

809
00:42:34,689 --> 00:42:36,495
It's why you should take action...

810
00:42:36,519 --> 00:42:38,120
before he brings home some riffraff.

811
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,459
Do you want me
to set him up with someone?

812
00:42:42,329 --> 00:42:44,675
How about the youngest daughter
of Mr. Hong...

813
00:42:44,699 --> 00:42:46,399
whom you met at the fundraiser?

814
00:42:46,529 --> 00:42:47,776
The one who's working
as a gallery curator...

815
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,470
after finishing her studies abroad?

816
00:42:49,569 --> 00:42:52,470
Exactly. The family is looking
for a doctor son-in-law.

817
00:42:52,939 --> 00:42:56,269
She seems perfect for Jae Seok.
Their ages are compatible too.

818
00:42:56,709 --> 00:42:57,980
Really?

819
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,509
The family is looking
for a doctor son-in-law?

820
00:43:00,649 --> 00:43:02,569
(Script by Park Hye Jin,
Directed by Bae Tae Jin)

821
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:04,855
So what's my role in this?

822
00:43:04,879 --> 00:43:06,526
The protagonist
is a young mob boss...

823
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:09,196
and he has two trustworthy men
by his side.

824
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:12,819
You want us to be the stuntmen...

825
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:15,165
for the protagonist
and his two henchmen?

826
00:43:15,189 --> 00:43:17,399
Yes, action scenes will continue...

827
00:43:17,529 --> 00:43:19,699
throughout the series.

828
00:43:20,269 --> 00:43:22,476
If you let us take on the role,

829
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,045
we'll give you everything we have.

830
00:43:24,069 --> 00:43:25,939
Sure, then you're on board...

831
00:43:27,339 --> 00:43:28,639
- Just a second.
- Sure.

832
00:43:29,139 --> 00:43:30,310
Yes, sir.

833
00:43:30,879 --> 00:43:32,209
I'm in a meeting...

834
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:34,410
Sorry?

835
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:39,949
Sure thing.

836
00:43:40,689 --> 00:43:41,689
Got it.

837
00:43:42,689 --> 00:43:44,490
So when does filming begin?

838
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,865
- I'm sorry but...
- Yes?

839
00:43:46,889 --> 00:43:49,105
My boss is recommending
another stunt agency.

840
00:43:49,129 --> 00:43:50,860
I'm afraid I'll have
to sit with him too.

841
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,029
I see.

842
00:43:56,230 --> 00:43:58,240
I'm Jang Ho Beom from Action Art.

843
00:43:58,370 --> 00:44:00,009
I look forward to working with you.

844
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:02,240
The situation isn't ideal,

845
00:44:02,339 --> 00:44:04,540
but we need to hire
the best company.

846
00:44:04,579 --> 00:44:07,355
We'll settle this with an audition.
How does next week sound?

847
00:44:07,379 --> 00:44:08,980
Sure. Bring it on.

848
00:44:10,019 --> 00:44:11,220
Sure thing.

849
00:44:11,579 --> 00:44:16,089
I wonder if Jeong Bong
and Jong Soo have improved.

850
00:44:16,589 --> 00:44:18,060
When they worked for me,

851
00:44:18,089 --> 00:44:20,529
they normally stuck
to cleaning the floors...

852
00:44:20,629 --> 00:44:22,459
because they weren't good enough.

853
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:25,906
They've improved so much...

854
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:29,329
that they can now lick ceilings
when they jump.

855
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:33,370
The leader can make a difference
in this line of work, right?

856
00:44:37,009 --> 00:44:40,550
Joon Seon, don't try too hard.

857
00:44:40,879 --> 00:44:44,180
There's no way you can beat us.

858
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:47,920
I know, which is why
we need to work harder.

859
00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:50,560
It's not like I have
connections like you do.

860
00:44:50,819 --> 00:44:53,889
Someone as clean as me...

861
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:56,605
can only work his butt off...

862
00:44:56,629 --> 00:44:58,259
to beat the likes of you
in any capacity.

863
00:44:59,629 --> 00:45:00,745
Sure thing.

864
00:45:00,769 --> 00:45:03,415
Then work as hard as you can.

865
00:45:03,439 --> 00:45:04,800
Good luck.

866
00:45:05,139 --> 00:45:06,370
Hold on.

867
00:45:06,939 --> 00:45:08,170
Here's my business card.

868
00:45:08,870 --> 00:45:12,009
(Good Action, Song Joon Seon,
Don't call)

869
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:13,879
How childish.

870
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:15,910
See you!

871
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:25,560
- Get the trivet.
- Sure.

872
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:27,089
Hurry.

873
00:45:27,790 --> 00:45:28,860
Here you go.

874
00:45:29,129 --> 00:45:30,129
Seriously?

875
00:45:30,899 --> 00:45:34,545
A sacred free weight?
How clever of you!

876
00:45:34,569 --> 00:45:36,716
Good job. It's perfect.

877
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:38,500
Look. Isn't it perfect?

878
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:41,410
- Let's eat.
- Thank you for the food.

879
00:45:42,370 --> 00:45:44,040
Stop right there!

880
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:51,379
That is why...

881
00:45:51,449 --> 00:45:53,720
we'll begin a special
training program as of today.

882
00:45:54,190 --> 00:45:56,025
Until the audition next week,

883
00:45:56,049 --> 00:45:59,090
our goal is to be
as light and nimble as we can.

884
00:46:00,659 --> 00:46:02,159
That punk, Jang Ho Beom.

885
00:46:02,490 --> 00:46:05,429
Let's teach
that slimy jerk a lesson.

886
00:46:06,059 --> 00:46:07,076
Can you do this?

887
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:08,330
Yes, of course!

888
00:46:08,529 --> 00:46:09,875
We'll make it happen!

889
00:46:09,899 --> 00:46:12,000
Yes, let's do this.

890
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:16,039
- 1, 2, let's go.
- Let's go!

891
00:46:18,639 --> 00:46:20,186
We're just never in sync.

892
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:21,686
Gosh, over here.

893
00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:23,495
- Goodness.
- Tell me about it.

894
00:46:23,519 --> 00:46:25,679
All right, here we go.

895
00:46:25,879 --> 00:46:27,466
Let's sweep.

896
00:46:27,490 --> 00:46:29,649
- Hold on.
- Here you go.

897
00:46:30,559 --> 00:46:32,659
- My gosh.
- Did you have to do that?

898
00:46:34,889 --> 00:46:38,005
- Here we go.
- Sweep, everyone.

899
00:46:38,029 --> 00:46:40,299
- All right.
- Here we go.

900
00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:42,846
Pass one each
to the merchants at the market.

901
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:44,676
It's from the association.

902
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:47,745
Is there enough to go around though?

903
00:46:47,769 --> 00:46:49,710
I think there is.

904
00:46:50,110 --> 00:46:51,485
Gosh, it's nice and cool.

905
00:46:51,509 --> 00:46:53,826
They must've been in the fridge.

906
00:46:53,850 --> 00:46:56,480
Young Dal,
you're as sweet as always.

907
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,350
Would you Like one?

908
00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:03,490
Open the cap for me then.

909
00:47:04,090 --> 00:47:05,190
Gosh, it's hot in here.

910
00:47:10,129 --> 00:47:11,875
You clumsy man.

911
00:47:11,899 --> 00:47:13,870
You've got bits of tissue
on your face.

912
00:47:13,899 --> 00:47:16,730
Why not help me take it off
instead of nagging me about it?

913
00:47:17,169 --> 00:47:18,870
- Come on.
- What on earth...

914
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:21,440
I can't believe
you're asking me to do this.

915
00:47:24,179 --> 00:47:25,840
Hello, everyone.

916
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:27,379
Welcome.

917
00:47:27,809 --> 00:47:29,879
Cho Yeon, what brings you by?

918
00:47:31,179 --> 00:47:35,166
I was wondering if I could borrow
a folding ladder.

919
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:38,535
Spiderwebs are all over
the top part of our sign.

920
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:40,460
I want to clean it,
but it's too high up.

921
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:42,235
Of course you can borrow it.

922
00:47:42,259 --> 00:47:43,806
Let's go. I'll get it done for you.

923
00:47:43,830 --> 00:47:46,035
Young Dal, where's the ladder?

924
00:47:46,059 --> 00:47:48,505
I'll go with you then.
While we're at it,

925
00:47:48,529 --> 00:47:50,145
we can clean the other signs too.

926
00:47:50,169 --> 00:47:52,375
Really? Then bring the ladder, okay?

927
00:47:52,399 --> 00:47:53,940
- Cho Yeon, shall we?
- Sure.

928
00:47:55,210 --> 00:47:57,139
- Please watch your step.
- Got it.

929
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:01,649
He's treating her like a princess.

930
00:48:04,350 --> 00:48:05,395
(Yongju Traditional Market
Merchant Co-op)

931
00:48:05,419 --> 00:48:08,525
It's from the merchant association.
Quench your thirst.

932
00:48:08,549 --> 00:48:10,235
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

933
00:48:10,259 --> 00:48:11,360
Thanks for this.

934
00:48:11,659 --> 00:48:12,860
Thanks.

935
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:15,535
Get your beverages!

936
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:18,706
First come, first served.
Get one before they run out.

937
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:20,546
What do you mean
first-come-first-served?

938
00:48:20,570 --> 00:48:22,810
They'll get here quicker this way.
We don't have all day.

939
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,600
- Hi.
- Can I get one too?

940
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:26,916
- Here.
- What's this?

941
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:28,285
- Is it from the association?
- Yes.

942
00:48:28,309 --> 00:48:30,485
Can I get one too?
I was thirsty anyway.

943
00:48:30,509 --> 00:48:34,309
Please form a line
in front of the president's wife.

944
00:48:34,409 --> 00:48:36,355
You each get one,

945
00:48:36,379 --> 00:48:38,296
so don't ask for more.

946
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:40,389
Gosh, thank you, Ms. Jang.

947
00:48:41,149 --> 00:48:43,690
By the way, how have you been?

948
00:48:44,019 --> 00:48:44,996
Sorry?

949
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:47,836
Oh, right. Yes, I've been fine.

950
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:49,535
Of course.

951
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:51,500
You should get over it
as fast as you can.

952
00:48:52,129 --> 00:48:55,370
Your kids' lives
never go the way you want them to.

953
00:48:55,629 --> 00:48:56,830
Anyway, hang in there.

954
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:58,217
Sure.

955
00:48:58,241 --> 00:49:00,740
Ok Boon, I'll take three.
They're for the rice cake store.

956
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:02,946
Don't be too upset, okay?

957
00:49:02,970 --> 00:49:06,009
She's pretty and good at her job.
What's there to worry about?

958
00:49:06,279 --> 00:49:08,250
I'm sure she'll meet
someone special again.

959
00:49:08,350 --> 00:49:09,350
Have a good day.

960
00:49:14,149 --> 00:49:15,549
Ms. Jang, can I get one too?

961
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:20,889
You must be so upset.

962
00:49:20,990 --> 00:49:24,000
Children are such nuisances,
aren't they?

963
00:49:24,059 --> 00:49:26,635
We're always worried about them
no matter what.

964
00:49:26,659 --> 00:49:28,029
Don't you think so?

965
00:49:28,429 --> 00:49:29,730
You're right.

966
00:49:30,539 --> 00:49:32,539
Hey, you take care of this.

967
00:49:33,169 --> 00:49:35,686
- Gosh, Ok Boon.
- Ms. Jang.

968
00:49:35,710 --> 00:49:37,115
- Gosh.
- Hey!

969
00:49:37,139 --> 00:49:38,755
You silly thing.

970
00:49:38,779 --> 00:49:40,255
Why are you so tactless?

971
00:49:40,279 --> 00:49:41,785
What did I do?

972
00:49:41,809 --> 00:49:43,796
- Just give me that. Don't drink it.
- Darn it.

973
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:45,155
Give it back to me.

974
00:49:45,179 --> 00:49:47,495
Chi Su, sweep the right part.

975
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:49,666
- Where? Here?
- Yes.

976
00:49:49,690 --> 00:49:50,966
(Unnie's Kimbap)

977
00:49:50,990 --> 00:49:54,206
Okay. I guess it's done.
Right, Cho Yeon?

978
00:49:54,230 --> 00:49:55,735
Yes. I think it's good enough.

979
00:49:55,759 --> 00:49:58,799
Both of you are so skilled.

980
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,600
Young Dal. Young Dal!

981
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:05,115
What's wrong?
Is there a fire or something?

982
00:50:05,139 --> 00:50:06,669
It's not like that.

983
00:50:07,570 --> 00:50:10,216
I think you should go to Ok Boon.

984
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:13,309
What's wrong with her?
Did she get hurt?

985
00:50:13,379 --> 00:50:16,056
She's hurt mentally, not physically.

986
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:17,679
- You should go see her.
- What?

987
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:21,149
Wait. What's wrong?

988
00:50:21,950 --> 00:50:24,120
Why did Ms. Jang get hurt?

989
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:27,490
Just mind your spiderweb.

990
00:50:36,870 --> 00:50:38,846
Are you done
cleaning the spiderwebs?

991
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:42,145
Yes. I was going
to give them some iced coffee,

992
00:50:42,169 --> 00:50:44,355
but the president left right away.

993
00:50:44,379 --> 00:50:46,015
Why? What's the rush?

994
00:50:46,039 --> 00:50:47,155
I don't know.

995
00:50:47,179 --> 00:50:50,210
He just took off
as he heard that his wife is hurt.

996
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:54,519
He doesn't seem like one,
but he's such a devoted husband.

997
00:50:54,850 --> 00:50:57,559
You know loving husbands
can't be mean.

998
00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:03,590
Look at you. You called him
a cold-hearted man before.

999
00:51:03,629 --> 00:51:06,275
I know. You even said you hate
this neighborhood because of him,

1000
00:51:06,299 --> 00:51:08,306
and that you're so unlucky
with neighbors.

1001
00:51:08,330 --> 00:51:11,940
I know what I said,
which is why I'm correcting myself.

1002
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:14,916
I should've borrowed
the ladder sooner.

1003
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:18,686
I struggled with my short arms
without one...

1004
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:20,509
and ended up covered in dust.

1005
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:22,309
I'll go get changed.

1006
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:24,250
Okay. Take your time.

1007
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:31,259
My gosh. Darn it.

1008
00:51:41,429 --> 00:51:44,539
Why? What's wrong?
What are you doing?

1009
00:51:44,639 --> 00:51:47,046
You can't even drink.
What do you think you're doing?

1010
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:48,885
Give me that! Without it,

1011
00:51:48,909 --> 00:51:50,416
I don't think
I can deal with this anger.

1012
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,509
I feel like I'm about to burst!

1013
00:51:56,210 --> 00:51:59,419
What? It's empty already.

1014
00:51:59,649 --> 00:52:03,466
Gosh, I'm so frustrated.

1015
00:52:03,490 --> 00:52:05,659
I'm so angry.

1016
00:52:07,259 --> 00:52:08,360
Gosh.

1017
00:52:11,230 --> 00:52:13,330
Why? Do you need more alcohol?

1018
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:15,870
Do you want to drink with me?

1019
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:31,320
You're here.

1020
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:33,789
Yes.

1021
00:53:23,669 --> 00:53:25,370
Gosh, that's not the right spot.

1022
00:53:25,899 --> 00:53:27,000
What are you doing?

1023
00:53:27,539 --> 00:53:28,940
I'm glad you're home.

1024
00:53:29,370 --> 00:53:31,809
Today's training session was rough.

1025
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:35,279
Can you put this on my back?

1026
00:53:36,279 --> 00:53:37,379
Where's Jong Soo?

1027
00:53:37,519 --> 00:53:40,620
He's taking a shower.
And Joon Seon is downstairs.

1028
00:53:41,649 --> 00:53:43,419
- Is it here?
- Yes.

1029
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:49,059
No, that's not it.
A little to the left.

1030
00:53:52,429 --> 00:53:55,500
Gosh, you should tell me
before you strip it off.

1031
00:53:56,529 --> 00:53:58,840
- So it should be here.
- Yes.

1032
00:54:01,470 --> 00:54:05,080
You moved it too far.
Move it to the right.

1033
00:54:05,679 --> 00:54:06,980
Slightly to the right...

1034
00:54:07,379 --> 00:54:09,950
Why do you keep
tearing it off so suddenly?

1035
00:54:10,279 --> 00:54:12,320
So it should be here.

1036
00:54:13,279 --> 00:54:15,765
I said left. It should go left.

1037
00:54:15,789 --> 00:54:18,120
It should be in the middle,
you stupid...

1038
00:54:19,919 --> 00:54:23,135
Hey. You're doing this on purpose,
aren't you?

1039
00:54:23,159 --> 00:54:24,799
You're trying to mess with me,
aren't you?

1040
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,906
What's wrong, Jeong Bong?

1041
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:29,430
He's trifling with me.

1042
00:54:30,170 --> 00:54:31,200
Bring it on.

1043
00:54:32,039 --> 00:54:33,099
Come on.

1044
00:54:33,369 --> 00:54:35,916
I was going to teach you a lesson.

1045
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:37,285
Today is the day.

1046
00:54:37,309 --> 00:54:39,980
You should be grateful
that I have sore muscles today.

1047
00:54:40,509 --> 00:54:42,226
- You're startled, aren't you?
- Gosh, stop it.

1048
00:54:42,250 --> 00:54:44,025
Jeong Bong, you can't kill him.

1049
00:54:44,049 --> 00:54:46,926
Don't stop me.
It's bound to happen at least once.

1050
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:48,295
Gosh, Jeong Bong.

1051
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:49,626
- Turning kick.
- Jeong Bong.

1052
00:54:49,650 --> 00:54:51,035
- I'll kick you.
- Please.

1053
00:54:51,059 --> 00:54:52,420
What's going on?

1054
00:54:52,990 --> 00:54:56,335
Who told you
to make a fuss like that?

1055
00:54:56,359 --> 00:54:58,930
So you have the energy to do this.
Do you need more training?

1056
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:00,376
No, it's not like that.

1057
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,130
I just tried to stop them.

1058
00:55:31,529 --> 00:55:32,805
Gosh, what's wrong with me?

1059
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:33,906
Enjoy your food.

1060
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:35,369
- Please enjoy.
- Thank you.

1061
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:41,210
You didn't bring much food.
Aren't you hungry?

1062
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:43,009
Not really.

1063
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:45,410
Maybe we should've
gone to a barbecue restaurant.

1064
00:55:46,339 --> 00:55:47,509
Buffets are always like that.

1065
00:55:48,210 --> 00:55:51,049
There are a lot of dishes
to choose from,

1066
00:55:51,619 --> 00:55:53,896
but we don't know what to eat...

1067
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,720
or how much to eat.

1068
00:55:56,390 --> 00:55:58,359
It just makes us hesitate.

1069
00:55:59,089 --> 00:56:00,759
It sounds like a happy hesitation.

1070
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:04,500
You think? I guess you're right.

1071
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:06,759
It's a lot better
than other kinds of hesitations.

1072
00:56:10,839 --> 00:56:13,069
Try this. It tastes good.

1073
00:56:16,470 --> 00:56:19,240
Have you not eaten in days?
What's with all the food?

1074
00:56:19,339 --> 00:56:20,650
I don't want to walk around.

1075
00:56:22,049 --> 00:56:24,420
Why do you even breathe?
That's a lot of work.

1076
00:56:24,519 --> 00:56:26,049
So I cram down air when I breathe.

1077
00:56:28,119 --> 00:56:29,150
By the way...

1078
00:56:31,319 --> 00:56:33,789
It has a strong flavor.

1079
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,890
That's why I like it.

1080
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,329
Thank you.

1081
00:56:37,759 --> 00:56:38,900
What?

1082
00:56:39,099 --> 00:56:41,869
Gyu Jin, there's something going on.

1083
00:56:41,930 --> 00:56:44,176
You know I have a good hunch
when it comes to these things.

1084
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:47,200
That's more flirting
than being friendly colleagues.

1085
00:56:47,769 --> 00:56:49,649
At least one of them has feelings
for the other.

1086
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:54,450
Don't be silly
and finish your mountain of food.

1087
00:56:54,910 --> 00:56:57,720
Are you sure
you don't care about it at all?

1088
00:56:57,950 --> 00:57:00,525
Of course I don't.
She's not with me anymore.

1089
00:57:00,549 --> 00:57:03,025
You're just trying to act cool.

1090
00:57:03,049 --> 00:57:04,660
Even I'm bothered.

1091
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:07,990
What?

1092
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:11,859
It's Mom. Why is she calling?

1093
00:57:12,130 --> 00:57:13,976
She yelled at me
and kicked me out yesterday.

1094
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,099
Why is she calling?
Gyu Jin, what do you think?

1095
00:57:16,130 --> 00:57:17,970
Just answer it.
Then you'll find out.

1096
00:57:22,609 --> 00:57:24,509
Hello, Mom. Hang on a second.

1097
00:57:27,339 --> 00:57:29,485
If you are done eating, can we go?

1098
00:57:29,509 --> 00:57:31,119
The next round is on me.

1099
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:32,250
That's great.

1100
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:37,089
Gyu Jin, are you coming with us?

1101
00:57:37,789 --> 00:57:39,289
The director is paying.

1102
00:57:41,390 --> 00:57:42,829
Must we go to a second round?

1103
00:57:49,970 --> 00:57:52,839
Yes, Mom. I'm at a team dinner
and it was quite noisy.

1104
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:55,309
I can talk now. What's the matter?

1105
00:57:55,740 --> 00:57:57,515
Is the dinner over yet?

1106
00:57:57,539 --> 00:57:59,109
Yes. We're almost done.

1107
00:57:59,710 --> 00:58:03,410
Why? You beat me up
and kicked me out yesterday.

1108
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:05,226
What do you want to know?

1109
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:08,095
Don't be silly and come home now.

1110
00:58:08,119 --> 00:58:11,835
What? Right now?
The dinner isn't over yet.

1111
00:58:11,859 --> 00:58:14,136
You said it's almost over.
Just come right away.

1112
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:15,430
Within 30 minutes.

1113
00:58:16,390 --> 00:58:17,529
Mom.

1114
00:58:18,529 --> 00:58:20,329
Gosh, what was that?

1115
00:58:21,829 --> 00:58:23,869
She's so one-sided.

1116
00:58:25,069 --> 00:58:26,349
I have a bad feeling about this.

1117
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:35,710
Why? I came right away
without going to the second round.

1118
00:58:36,049 --> 00:58:37,489
Why are you staring at me like that?

1119
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:43,095
Mom, just say it.

1120
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:45,390
You must've called me in
so urgently for a reason.

1121
00:58:45,589 --> 00:58:48,230
Do you want me to spy on Gyu Jin?

1122
00:58:48,730 --> 00:58:51,460
That's what I'm good at.

1123
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:53,329
I want you to go on a blind date.

1124
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:55,000
What did you say?

1125
00:58:55,069 --> 00:58:58,440
A blind date for marriage.
I've made up my mind.

1126
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:02,440
I will never let you
choose your own wife.

1127
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:04,416
I'll check her background,
personality, and everything...

1128
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:06,656
to choose
a good wife for you myself.

1129
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:09,085
Mom, in this day and age?

1130
00:59:09,109 --> 00:59:11,255
Who has arranged marriages
these days?

1131
00:59:11,279 --> 00:59:13,025
Besides, I don't even
want to get married.

1132
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:14,126
I don't believe in marriage.

1133
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:16,495
Okay. Don't be so sure about that.

1134
00:59:16,519 --> 00:59:17,835
Just meet the girl.

1135
00:59:17,859 --> 00:59:20,235
If you don't like her,
I'll find someone else.

1136
00:59:20,259 --> 00:59:22,436
Make a suggestion
that makes sense...

1137
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:24,035
if you want me to accept...

1138
00:59:24,059 --> 00:59:25,099
If not,

1139
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,970
will you come back home?

1140
00:59:29,529 --> 00:59:30,569
What?

1141
00:59:31,039 --> 00:59:32,640
You don't want to live here.

1142
00:59:32,970 --> 00:59:35,245
Don't you prefer to
live with Gyu Jin?

1143
00:59:35,269 --> 00:59:36,609
It's up to you.

1144
00:59:36,869 --> 00:59:38,809
Come back home,

1145
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:40,950
or go on a blind date.

1146
00:59:47,119 --> 00:59:50,150
Dance with us, everyone!

1147
00:59:53,319 --> 00:59:54,460
Director Lee.

1148
00:59:56,789 --> 00:59:57,805
Director Lee.

1149
00:59:57,829 --> 01:00:01,029
At all costs, at all costs

1150
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:06,299
Why aren't you married?

1151
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,039
When did you last have a girlfriend?

1152
01:00:09,170 --> 01:00:10,640
My last girlfriend?

1153
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:13,180
It was so long ago,
I don't remember.

1154
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:15,279
Has it been seven years?

1155
01:00:15,579 --> 01:00:17,795
No way. Why?

1156
01:00:17,819 --> 01:00:20,349
You must have high standards.

1157
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:22,049
What do you care about?

1158
01:00:22,150 --> 01:00:24,319
What kind of woman do you like?

1159
01:00:24,490 --> 01:00:26,735
Why are you so curious?

1160
01:00:26,759 --> 01:00:28,230
You're all leaning in.

1161
01:00:29,130 --> 01:00:31,930
I guess I like someone
who's honest and funny.

1162
01:00:32,359 --> 01:00:34,000
Someone I get along with.

1163
01:00:34,970 --> 01:00:36,275
Personality over looks?

1164
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:38,146
- That's a tough standard.
- It is.

1165
01:00:38,170 --> 01:00:39,500
You're picky.

1166
01:00:39,869 --> 01:00:40,970
Am I?

1167
01:00:41,170 --> 01:00:44,616
The love I have for you

1168
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:48,150
Is a special, express kind of love

1169
01:00:49,349 --> 01:00:51,950
- At all costs
- Come on!

1170
01:00:58,220 --> 01:01:00,589
Next up is Dr. Yoon!

1171
01:01:03,289 --> 01:01:06,200
- Dr. Yoon.
- I said I won't sing!

1172
01:01:07,769 --> 01:01:08,930
16296.

1173
01:01:14,809 --> 01:01:16,609
I said I didn't want to sing.

1174
01:01:17,509 --> 01:01:18,940
What's the song called?

1175
01:01:37,630 --> 01:01:40,930
Yes, sure. Let's meet up next week.

1176
01:01:42,730 --> 01:01:45,740
Hey, I'll call you back later. Bye.

1177
01:01:49,039 --> 01:01:51,309
Do you not feel well? Are you okay?

1178
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:55,650
It's a stomach thing.
I must have indigestion.

1179
01:01:57,349 --> 01:02:00,849
You didn't look well since dinner
and I forced you to eat.

1180
01:02:01,049 --> 01:02:02,289
Are you all right?

1181
01:02:05,690 --> 01:02:08,589
Get up if you can.

1182
01:02:10,390 --> 01:02:11,529
Stand up.

1183
01:02:14,970 --> 01:02:17,329
You look unwell. You're pale too.

1184
01:02:18,670 --> 01:02:19,869
Give me your hand.

1185
01:02:22,569 --> 01:02:26,710
Shouldn't you go to the hospital
and get an IV drip or something?

1186
01:02:36,349 --> 01:02:38,119
What's wrong? What's the matter?

1187
01:02:39,460 --> 01:02:43,329
Dr. Song has indigestion
and it looks pretty bad.

1188
01:02:43,990 --> 01:02:45,359
This doesn't work.

1189
01:02:46,329 --> 01:02:48,369
She has a weak stomach
and gets sick easily.

1190
01:02:49,529 --> 01:02:51,900
Na Hee, do you have
medicine at home?

1191
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:55,240
I'll get you a taxi. Go home.

1192
01:02:56,369 --> 01:02:58,910
You need medicine
and sleep to get better.

1193
01:03:00,009 --> 01:03:01,250
I'll get your bag.

1194
01:03:01,910 --> 01:03:03,009
I won't be long.

1195
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:08,927
Let's go.

1196
01:03:08,951 --> 01:03:11,265
Let's get you into the taxi.

1197
01:03:11,289 --> 01:03:12,559
Watch your head.

1198
01:03:13,859 --> 01:03:16,630
Take some medicine
as soon as you get home.

1199
01:03:16,730 --> 01:03:18,029
Get home safely.

1200
01:03:18,460 --> 01:03:20,329
To Jungang-dong, please.

1201
01:03:30,109 --> 01:03:32,240
Let's get back.
The others will be waiting for us.

1202
01:03:33,079 --> 01:03:34,279
I guess...

1203
01:03:35,049 --> 01:03:37,109
you're not completely over her yet.

1204
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:38,920
What?

1205
01:03:41,119 --> 01:03:42,619
You look a bit on edge.

1206
01:03:51,799 --> 01:03:54,970
Wow, then it's a massive audition.

1207
01:03:55,069 --> 01:03:56,446
I'm impressed.

1208
01:03:56,470 --> 01:03:58,515
It's only impressive if he passes.

1209
01:03:58,539 --> 01:04:00,339
Attending the audition is nothing.

1210
01:04:00,740 --> 01:04:02,839
Do you have to put it like that?

1211
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:05,440
I won't open you a nail salon
even if I make a fortune.

1212
01:04:05,539 --> 01:04:07,926
Da Hee, you can study abroad twice.
I'll pay for it.

1213
01:04:07,950 --> 01:04:09,686
- You will? Great.
- Sure.

1214
01:04:09,710 --> 01:04:11,680
How can you take that back?

1215
01:04:14,789 --> 01:04:15,819
It's Dad.

1216
01:04:16,650 --> 01:04:18,595
- Dad, why aren't you back yet?
- This is delicious.

1217
01:04:18,619 --> 01:04:21,460
Come over to the store right now.

1218
01:04:21,630 --> 01:04:23,930
The store? Why? What's wrong?

1219
01:04:24,430 --> 01:04:26,535
- Why? What's wrong?
- What's going on?

1220
01:04:26,559 --> 01:04:28,505
- What is happening?
- My gosh.

1221
01:04:28,529 --> 01:04:30,106
Shut your mouths and run. Mom!

1222
01:04:30,130 --> 01:04:31,670
- Mom!
- Mom!

1223
01:04:32,799 --> 01:04:35,815
- They're good for nothing.
- You're right.

1224
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:37,916
I don't believe my rotten luck.

1225
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:39,216
- I'm...
- Mom!

1226
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:40,509
- Mom.
- Listen!

1227
01:04:40,609 --> 01:04:41,686
Mom!

1228
01:04:41,710 --> 01:04:43,926
- Mom, what's wrong?
- Mom.

1229
01:04:43,950 --> 01:04:46,555
- How much did you drink?
- Listen!

1230
01:04:46,579 --> 01:04:48,565
Get out of the way.

1231
01:04:48,589 --> 01:04:53,366
Why you darn scumbags,
sons of witches, jerks, and punks!

1232
01:04:53,390 --> 01:04:55,859
Wow, that was crazy.
Did Mom just swear?

1233
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:57,259
Dad, what happened?

1234
01:04:57,359 --> 01:04:59,329
I have no idea.

1235
01:04:59,430 --> 01:05:02,400
She started downing soju
saying she was furious,

1236
01:05:02,569 --> 01:05:05,446
and I gave her a few more bottles
to put out the fire.

1237
01:05:05,470 --> 01:05:08,345
I had no idea your mom
was like this when drunk.

1238
01:05:08,369 --> 01:05:09,640
- Hey!
- No.

1239
01:05:09,769 --> 01:05:14,015
You darn good-for-nothing blockhead!

1240
01:05:14,039 --> 01:05:15,785
Shut your mouth.

1241
01:05:15,809 --> 01:05:18,426
Carry your mom home
before she wakes the neighborhood.

1242
01:05:18,450 --> 01:05:19,896
- What?
- Carry her.

1243
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:21,995
- Mom, get on my back.
- How dare you?

1244
01:05:22,019 --> 01:05:24,995
Get out of the way,
you idiotic fool!

1245
01:05:25,019 --> 01:05:26,765
Hey, no, I feel sleepy.

1246
01:05:26,789 --> 01:05:29,565
I want to sleep, you scumbag!

1247
01:05:29,589 --> 01:05:31,206
- Mom, stop swearing.
- Hey.

1248
01:05:31,230 --> 01:05:33,176
- Get on his back.
- Hey! No!

1249
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:35,005
What are you doing to me?

1250
01:05:35,029 --> 01:05:37,200
- What are you doing?
- Mom!

1251
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:40,140
I don't care about anything.

1252
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:44,416
I'm in this world alone anyway.

1253
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:46,609
I've never heard Mom swear.

1254
01:05:46,710 --> 01:05:48,985
Her language is so colorful.
She never repeats a word.

1255
01:05:49,009 --> 01:05:53,325
Hey. Your face is bigger than big.

1256
01:05:53,349 --> 01:05:54,456
I'm your son.

1257
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:56,789
- Is it my fault?
- I've never seen Mom drunk.

1258
01:05:57,190 --> 01:05:59,519
She doesn't even like alcohol.

1259
01:06:00,019 --> 01:06:02,930
Mom is such an elegant person.

1260
01:06:03,289 --> 01:06:05,505
Who made her like this?

1261
01:06:05,529 --> 01:06:06,960
You jerks.

1262
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:10,700
I really don't care about
anything anymore, darn you.

1263
01:06:12,170 --> 01:06:13,799
- Joon Seon.
- Darn you.

1264
01:06:18,940 --> 01:06:21,055
How do you feel? A bit better?

1265
01:06:21,079 --> 01:06:22,950
It's stress-induced.

1266
01:06:23,710 --> 01:06:26,849
I'll feel better
once I have some medicine.

1267
01:06:27,180 --> 01:06:28,950
You seemed so fine.

1268
01:06:29,319 --> 01:06:30,890
You were pretending, weren't you?

1269
01:06:31,990 --> 01:06:33,319
I think so.

1270
01:06:35,190 --> 01:06:37,029
I can deal with everything else,

1271
01:06:38,630 --> 01:06:41,730
but I moved back home
and my mom won't look at me.

1272
01:06:43,099 --> 01:06:45,676
She has never
treated me like this before.

1273
01:06:45,700 --> 01:06:46,940
I see.

1274
01:06:47,869 --> 01:06:49,509
- That must be tough.
- Jeong Rok.

1275
01:06:49,740 --> 01:06:51,356
Sorry. I'll see you tomorrow.

1276
01:06:51,380 --> 01:06:53,710
- That hurts.
- Don't complain!

1277
01:06:53,839 --> 01:06:55,985
- Is Mom sick or something?
- Shoot.

1278
01:06:56,009 --> 01:06:58,025
No. She's just drunk!

1279
01:06:58,049 --> 01:06:59,795
She drank soju
straight from the bottle.

1280
01:06:59,819 --> 01:07:01,049
What?

1281
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:05,220
Mom, are you all right?

1282
01:07:06,319 --> 01:07:10,190
Hey, isn't this the traitor?

1283
01:07:11,259 --> 01:07:12,876
Hey, put me down.

1284
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:14,476
I'll walk from here.

1285
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:16,545
- Mom!
- Darn you.

1286
01:07:16,569 --> 01:07:18,315
- Darn you!
- You'll fall over.

1287
01:07:18,339 --> 01:07:20,315
- Mom.
- Stop it.

1288
01:07:20,339 --> 01:07:22,015
- Hey, you.
- My goodness.

1289
01:07:22,039 --> 01:07:23,869
You can barely stand straight.

1290
01:07:24,039 --> 01:07:25,386
- Carry her in.
- Okay. Mom.

1291
01:07:25,410 --> 01:07:26,779
Hey!

1292
01:07:27,509 --> 01:07:31,109
I hate everyone so much,

1293
01:07:31,750 --> 01:07:35,589
but I hate you the most, you jerk!

1294
01:07:44,730 --> 01:07:45,900
Dad!

1295
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:47,660
Mom!

1296
01:07:51,069 --> 01:07:52,299
My gosh.

1297
01:08:15,990 --> 01:08:18,859
(Once Again)

1298
01:08:20,299 --> 01:08:21,569
You fell over again.

1299
01:08:22,670 --> 01:08:23,970
Do you want to play a sport?

1300
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:26,140
Keep it a secret from my mom.

1301
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:27,940
She'll just worry.

1302
01:08:28,140 --> 01:08:30,470
Ms. Song! I mean... Ex-in-law!

1303
01:08:30,670 --> 01:08:32,380
What did you want to talk about?

1304
01:08:32,609 --> 01:08:33,809
Be my girlfriend.

1305
01:08:34,009 --> 01:08:35,049
What?

1306
01:08:35,609 --> 01:08:37,680
I thought about it at home.

1307
01:08:37,779 --> 01:08:39,119
Is that really it?

1308
01:08:40,519 --> 01:08:42,049
I have nothing to say to you.

1309
01:08:42,190 --> 01:08:43,595
How long will you be like this?

1310
01:08:43,619 --> 01:08:45,466
Don't ask me. Sort it out yourself.

1311
01:08:45,490 --> 01:08:48,390
Did you ever ask for my opinion
before doing something?

1312
01:08:48,559 --> 01:08:50,759
I'll move out, Dad.

1313
01:08:50,990 --> 01:08:52,329
I'm sorry.
