1
00:00:24,211 --> 00:00:26,541
(Jae Hyun and Ji Su, Our love will last a million years.)

2
00:00:38,821 --> 00:00:43,190
(For a million years... Our love shall bloom.)

3
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:44,190
Jae Hyun.

4
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,200
I want for us to finally end it now.

5
00:00:51,761 --> 00:00:54,330
It has been so many years,

6
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:57,201
but I still feel bad and miss it.

7
00:01:01,511 --> 00:01:04,110
I think it's because we never properly said goodbye.

8
00:01:05,351 --> 00:01:07,151
So we need a proper farewell.

9
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:10,851
A complete goodbye.

10
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:13,720
I can't do that, Ji Su.

11
00:01:17,561 --> 00:01:18,791
I want to protect it.

12
00:01:23,101 --> 00:01:24,731
It's not because I feel bad...

13
00:01:26,071 --> 00:01:27,571
or because I miss it,

14
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:30,701
nor is it because of some hope.

15
00:01:31,201 --> 00:01:32,970
It's not "I wanted to protect it."

16
00:01:34,811 --> 00:01:36,011
I want to protect it.

17
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:40,211
Because of that one desire.

18
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,750
Just like you did.

19
00:01:49,791 --> 00:01:52,130
Just 20 years out of a million?

20
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:57,101
We just took one step forward.

21
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:00,431
How can we part now?

22
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:08,511
Why you made the choice you did,

23
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,011
I found out.

24
00:02:10,941 --> 00:02:12,710
It was because of me,

25
00:02:14,381 --> 00:02:15,981
so I will correct it.

26
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:41,541
I see you've been holding me captive without my noticing.

27
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,580
You should've been more careful if you were going to act like that.

28
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,851
You know how the world is today.

29
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:52,421
You will have to stop what you are planning.

30
00:02:54,821 --> 00:02:56,860
I have no intention of doing so.

31
00:02:57,761 --> 00:02:58,930
Go ahead and...

32
00:02:59,731 --> 00:03:01,060
reveal the video.

33
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,900
Are you sure about that?

34
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:05,430
They haven't even finished your investigation yet.

35
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,430
(Lee Se Hun)

36
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:07,671
It doesn't matter.

37
00:03:08,571 --> 00:03:10,501
I will also be winning through this.

38
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:18,281
Take the child from the mother...

39
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,451
who had been having an affair.

40
00:03:25,381 --> 00:03:26,990
And I will be taking Ji Su...

41
00:03:27,851 --> 00:03:29,291
when she loses her child.

42
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,770
A long time ago,

43
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:42,300
Jae Hyun said he lost something.

44
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,701
With very sad eyes.

45
00:03:46,911 --> 00:03:49,781
It's you, isn't it?

46
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,890
You won't deny it, so I'm right.

47
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,550
I want to know something.

48
00:04:04,261 --> 00:04:08,060
I think you two were very much in love.

49
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:09,900
Why did you break up?

50
00:04:18,141 --> 00:04:20,870
You're taking turns to make me look bad.

51
00:04:22,211 --> 00:04:23,940
You both say you'll...

52
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,310
sacrifice yourself for the other as if you agreed on it.

53
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,981
If you loved each other so much,

54
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,680
why did you break up?

55
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:41,360
I said what I came to say. I will leave now.

56
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,570
I left him.

57
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:58,310
Can I ask why?

58
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,581
My life fell down in a single moment,

59
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:09,360
and my fury and despair took over.

60
00:05:12,391 --> 00:05:14,490
I was afraid I'd hurt him too.

61
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,901
I don't understand,

62
00:05:19,401 --> 00:05:23,101
but if it was that hard, couldn't you have shared the pain?

63
00:05:23,901 --> 00:05:25,711
Sharing the pain...

64
00:05:27,211 --> 00:05:28,981
wouldn't have halved it.

65
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,851
We'd have both become monsters.

66
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,711
Take me to your bar.

67
00:06:09,351 --> 00:06:10,851
Are you sure about this?

68
00:06:11,081 --> 00:06:12,320
You can't drink.

69
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,421
You remember that?

70
00:06:15,521 --> 00:06:18,260
You used to be my idol.

71
00:06:19,891 --> 00:06:21,860
I liked you. You seemed cool.

72
00:06:22,231 --> 00:06:23,760
I wanted to be like you.

73
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:27,130
I protested because you did.

74
00:06:28,271 --> 00:06:29,771
Whether it changed the world or not.

75
00:06:31,671 --> 00:06:33,510
But what you're doing now...

76
00:06:33,971 --> 00:06:35,541
seems greedy and foolish.

77
00:06:36,581 --> 00:06:38,281
You're just being selfish.

78
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:45,921
I've decided to interfere in Ji Su's life.

79
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,260
What'll you do?

80
00:06:51,421 --> 00:06:52,891
I don't accept him...

81
00:06:53,961 --> 00:06:55,060
or you either.

82
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,901
It has to be you?

83
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:59,870
I don't care if it's not me.

84
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:02,700
As long as Ji Su's happy.

85
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,641
That's what...

86
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,940
both you and I want,

87
00:07:08,171 --> 00:07:10,310
and it seems to be so hard.

88
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:12,781
What you said...

89
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,380
to Lee Se Hun earlier.

90
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,450
Were you serious?

91
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,250
I was, Young Woo.

92
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:24,291
If that were to happen,

93
00:07:25,021 --> 00:07:26,391
I'll claim Ji Su.

94
00:07:39,341 --> 00:07:42,041
(Family Relation Certificate)

95
00:07:45,211 --> 00:07:47,281
You haven't forgotten about tomorrow, right?

96
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,550
You know what to bring.

97
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:52,620
Why you made the choice you did,

98
00:07:53,021 --> 00:07:54,190
I found out.

99
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:56,221
It was because of me,

100
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,560
so I will correct it.

101
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:13,070
(Jae Hyun)

102
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:15,041
Where are you? I'll come.

103
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,180
(Jae Hyun)

104
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:27,320
Don't do it, Ji Su.

105
00:08:28,151 --> 00:08:30,090
If you do something silly again,

106
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:33,190
I'll do something silly as well.

107
00:08:34,261 --> 00:08:36,001
If you go back to him,

108
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,771
I will have the video released.

109
00:08:41,171 --> 00:08:42,641
You will lose...

110
00:08:44,241 --> 00:08:45,700
everything you have.

111
00:08:47,111 --> 00:08:48,271
I will.

112
00:08:50,141 --> 00:08:53,580
I might even get stoned in the street.

113
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:57,820
But Ji Su. Look back.

114
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:00,751
Why did we break up?

115
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:18,901
Can you really cook?

116
00:09:18,901 --> 00:09:20,411
(May 1995)

117
00:09:20,411 --> 00:09:22,241
I cooked since I was in middle school.

118
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,141
Mom and Dad both worked.

119
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:27,310
You grew up early.

120
00:09:28,381 --> 00:09:30,521
Kids who are alone grow up fast.

121
00:09:31,421 --> 00:09:33,690
I feel kind of sorry for you,

122
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:35,921
but it's also nice.

123
00:09:36,261 --> 00:09:38,261
How shall we raise our kids?

124
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:44,830
- Are you okay? - Excuse me.

125
00:09:45,031 --> 00:09:46,531
Are you Han Jae Hyun?

126
00:09:48,371 --> 00:09:49,901
You ignored your draft notice,

127
00:09:49,901 --> 00:09:51,771
and are wanted under Military Service Law.

128
00:09:51,771 --> 00:09:54,310
As of 11:05am of May 20, 1995,

129
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:55,840
you're under immediate arrest.

130
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:03,521
Don't hold him so tight. You're hurting him!

131
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:12,060
Go home and don't worry.

132
00:10:12,121 --> 00:10:13,391
It's my fault.

133
00:10:14,031 --> 00:10:15,930
I think it was my dad.

134
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:18,901
You said you applied to enlist later on.

135
00:10:19,901 --> 00:10:22,671
Get my things from the house with the persimmon tree.

136
00:10:23,501 --> 00:10:25,671
They're expensive, so don't run away with them.

137
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,480
It's just a while.

138
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,021
See you a while later.

(May 12, Hiding with Ji Su in the house with a persimmon tree)

142
00:12:59,661 --> 00:13:04,330
One starry night

143
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:10,600
I hear your voice

144
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:20,111
I wish to become white pollen

145
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:28,690
And land on your flower

146
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:35,791
As I look up at the night sky

147
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:42,100
I feel your breath

148
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:51,940
I wish to take a small boat

149
00:13:54,011 --> 00:13:59,751
And sail on your lake

150
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:08,391
If you are to leave my side

151
00:14:09,161 --> 00:14:12,100
I will follow you to the end

Where are you?

156
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:38,491
I'm sorry for changing my mind.

157
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,401
I can't go back to you.

158

I'm not being manipulated.

159
00:14:49,771 --> 00:14:53,241
I want to take a stand whether it's against fate or people.

Your husband came to see me.

163
00:15:17,661 --> 00:15:19,631
Did he know anything?

164
00:15:19,871 --> 00:15:21,430
He knew about the video...

165
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:23,401
and that I was trying to reconcile with Ji Su.

166
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,641
- And? - If we release the video,

167

he said he'll claim Ji Su.

168
00:15:32,511 --> 00:15:35,450
I think he got to Ji Su as well.

169

She said she won't come back to me.

170

00:16:17,861 --> 00:16:21,730
If you were to get it back, I was going to congratulate you.

172
00:16:22,761 --> 00:16:23,930
But I can't.

173
00:16:27,031 --> 00:16:29,940
Why won't you say anything...

174
00:16:30,741 --> 00:16:32,741
when you know I handed over the video?

175
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:34,810
Because I'm in the wrong.

176
00:16:36,111 --> 00:16:37,810
So what, Seo Kyung?

177
00:16:38,011 --> 00:16:40,911
You deliberately said it was something you'd lost.

178
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,720
I was lost,

179
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:47,690
not abandoned.

180
00:16:51,121 --> 00:16:52,820
Mom. Mom.

181
00:16:55,531 --> 00:16:57,230
(Jang Seo Kyung)

182
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:23,490
If you're abandoned once,

183
00:17:24,361 --> 00:17:26,091
you blame the one who left you.

184
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,190
If you're abandoned twice,

185
00:17:29,391 --> 00:17:30,601
you blame yourself.

186
00:17:34,071 --> 00:17:35,131
So...

187
00:17:36,371 --> 00:17:37,500
don't abandon me.

188
00:17:40,841 --> 00:17:42,040
It hurts my pride.

189
00:17:56,091 --> 00:17:59,260
The food's ready. Come in and eat.

190
00:20:48,849 --> 00:20:50,649
Did my wife put them there?

191
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:53,089
She told me to throw them out.

192
00:20:54,288 --> 00:20:55,619
I'll take care of them.

(2nd Album of Zoo)

194
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:59,488
Can you find me a cassette player?

195
00:21:00,728 --> 00:21:02,228
The retro culture from the 90s is hip these days.

196
00:21:02,228 --> 00:21:03,929
So I'll easily find one online.

197
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,228
Then, can you find me one?

198
00:21:06,228 --> 00:21:07,468
Sure.

199
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:10,839
I guess you're also visiting the Online Tapgol Park.

200
00:21:11,068 --> 00:21:12,238
Where's that?

201
00:21:12,639 --> 00:21:14,708
I see. Well,

202
00:21:15,379 --> 00:21:18,278
it's not a real place. It's an online website.

203
00:21:18,909 --> 00:21:20,318
It's where you walk down memory lane...

204
00:21:20,318 --> 00:21:21,879
while watching music shows from the 90s.

205
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:24,689
Hey, it sounds like you're calling me old.

206
00:21:24,689 --> 00:21:26,548
No. Not at all.

207
00:21:26,988 --> 00:21:28,958
I know the slangs young people use these days.

208
00:21:29,589 --> 00:21:30,659
Totally hating it.

209
00:21:32,629 --> 00:21:33,958
Why are you laughing?

(Kim Hyun Sik)

211
00:22:26,548 --> 00:22:28,679
I don't think you went through with it.

212
00:22:29,649 --> 00:22:31,419
But I was curious about your decision.

213
00:22:31,419 --> 00:22:33,189
(But I was curious about your decision.)

214
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:37,929
I decided to not get back together with him.

215
00:22:37,929 --> 00:22:39,429
(I decided to not get back together with him.)

216
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:41,699
I'm glad to hear that.

217
00:22:41,699 --> 00:22:44,268
(I'm glad to hear that.)

218
00:22:49,169 --> 00:22:52,939
I think it's better that you and I don't meet.

219
00:22:52,939 --> 00:22:54,909
(I think it's better that you and I don't meet.)

220
00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:03,949
I want to protect you.

221
00:23:05,288 --> 00:23:08,119
It's coming from the bottom of my heart. And it's my goal.

(It's coming from the bottom of my heart. And it's my goal.)

223
00:23:10,659 --> 00:23:13,958
Whether you see me or not, I'll do my best.

224
00:23:13,958 --> 00:23:15,629
(Whether you see me or not, I'll do my best.)

225
00:23:21,439 --> 00:23:23,468
And I'll do my best...

226
00:23:23,939 --> 00:23:25,839
to get far away from you.

227

(Karam International Middle School)

Young Min.

230
00:23:52,329 --> 00:23:55,468
My gosh. You look like Leon.

231
00:23:56,139 --> 00:23:57,268
Who's Leon?

232
00:23:58,139 --> 00:24:00,208
He's a cool guy.

233
00:24:00,508 --> 00:24:02,579
The school gave one to everyone.

234
00:24:02,978 --> 00:24:04,449
I want to grow it at home.

235
00:24:06,579 --> 00:24:09,548
Not at home. Why don't you grow it somewhere more spacious?

236
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:11,889
The roots won't go deeply in a flowerpot.

237
00:24:12,718 --> 00:24:13,788
Sounds good.

238
00:24:18,689 --> 00:24:22,599
Young Min, it would've been better for you if you lived at a big house.

239
00:24:24,869 --> 00:24:27,599
Like the house you saw with your dad.

240
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:31,738
Are we really going to live with him?

241
00:24:37,579 --> 00:24:38,649
Young Min.

242
00:24:40,179 --> 00:24:41,748
Can you forgive me just this once?

243
00:24:42,818 --> 00:24:44,548
I did something bad.

244
00:24:45,788 --> 00:24:47,258
Without discussing it with you first,

245
00:24:47,258 --> 00:24:49,689
I told you that we were going to live with him.

246
00:24:51,129 --> 00:24:53,288
And then, I told him that I couldn't do that.

247
00:24:53,899 --> 00:24:55,599
Then, does it mean we won't live with him?

248
00:24:59,268 --> 00:25:00,439
I'll forgive you.

249
00:25:01,439 --> 00:25:02,568
Are you okay?

250
00:25:03,099 --> 00:25:05,869
Not living with him is slightly better for me.

251
00:25:06,139 --> 00:25:07,179
Why?

252
00:25:07,708 --> 00:25:09,278
You don't like him.

253
00:25:09,978 --> 00:25:11,409
That's why you broke up.

254
00:25:12,449 --> 00:25:14,278
You agreed to live with him,

255
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:16,919
but you realized you couldn't do it.

256
00:25:19,589 --> 00:25:21,619
You're only a middle schooler.

257
00:25:22,018 --> 00:25:23,788
But you're too rational.

258
00:25:23,829 --> 00:25:25,389
No, I'm sensitive to feelings.

259
00:25:25,758 --> 00:25:27,798
Living with him scares me and is uncomfortable.

260
00:25:32,099 --> 00:25:33,998
My baby is growing up too quickly.

261
00:25:36,099 --> 00:25:37,909
Is it because he's the only child?

262
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:46,008
(The original soundtracks of the movie, "Leon")

263
00:25:46,008 --> 00:25:47,978
I guess I cried too much after watching the movie.

264
00:25:47,978 --> 00:25:49,419
I can't see.

265
00:25:49,718 --> 00:25:51,248
Take off your sunglasses.

266

My gosh. These are too black.

267
00:25:54,988 --> 00:25:56,318
Did you really cry?

00:25:56,389 --> 00:25:57,859
You bet.

269
00:25:57,988 --> 00:26:00,458
My brother, Leon, broke my heart.

He's such an unlucky guy.

271
00:26:04,068 --> 00:26:06,728
Mathilda's last line was heartbreaking too.

272
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:08,169
What did she say?

273
00:26:08,439 --> 00:26:10,968
This is what she said when she was replanting the plant at a park.

274
00:26:11,468 --> 00:26:14,109
"We will be okay here, Leon."

275
00:26:14,609 --> 00:26:17,278
We will be okay here, Leon.

276
00:26:17,649 --> 00:26:20,649
Ji Su, you can speak pretty good English.

277
00:26:20,778 --> 00:26:22,318
It's her listening skill.

278
00:26:22,649 --> 00:26:25,589
Whatever. Since we're talking about the movie,

279
00:26:25,988 --> 00:26:29,058
why don't we drink something that looked like the milk...

280
00:26:29,058 --> 00:26:31,129
Leon was drinking? How about a bowl of rice wine?

281
00:26:31,629 --> 00:26:34,099
You said you'd leave after watching the movie.

282
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:38,468
Who do you think I am? Why do you keep telling me to leave?

283
00:26:38,468 --> 00:26:41,068
My gosh, do you think you're funny? That was not funny at all.

284
00:26:41,669 --> 00:26:43,399
By the way, there's something I want.

285
00:26:43,399 --> 00:26:46,409
Hey, let's go drink rice wine. Don't go shopping.

286
00:26:46,639 --> 00:26:47,679
What is it?

287
00:26:48,808 --> 00:26:49,839
Leon.

288
00:26:53,149 --> 00:26:54,179
What?

289
00:26:58,218 --> 00:27:01,589
Just because you're holding a plant, it doesn't make you Mathilda.

290
00:27:02,018 --> 00:27:05,288
A girl who can pull that off comes once in a million years.

291
00:27:06,089 --> 00:27:07,599
Ji Su is much prettier.

292
00:27:10,099 --> 00:27:11,699
You guys are ridiculous.

293
00:27:12,028 --> 00:27:14,099
Do you think I'll be jealous...

294
00:27:15,738 --> 00:27:17,669
Of course. I'm totally jealous.

295
00:27:31,619 --> 00:27:33,189
Why are we planting it here?

296
00:27:33,619 --> 00:27:34,859
Because...

297
00:27:35,818 --> 00:27:37,129
this is a special place.

298
00:27:37,558 --> 00:27:38,958
What's special about it?

299
00:27:39,488 --> 00:27:41,728
Well, there's the Lord.

300
00:27:41,728 --> 00:27:45,199
And there's Our Lady. There are a lot of priests...

301
00:27:45,199 --> 00:27:46,669
and believers too.

302
00:27:48,699 --> 00:27:50,609
It won't be lonely at least.

303
00:27:53,109 --> 00:27:54,179

(June 1995)

305
00:28:27,139 --> 00:28:29,478
I finally planted Leon in a big garden.

306
00:28:30,409 --> 00:28:32,909
I didn't have to think about where. I planted it there.

307
00:28:34,449 --> 00:28:37,089
"We will be okay here, Leon."

308

We will be okay here.

I'm glad you're here.

00:31:10,439 --> 00:31:13,308
Actually, I've been wanting to have a drink with you.

318
00:31:18,579 --> 00:31:21,048
Why are you moping around here again?

319
00:31:23,379 --> 00:31:25,149
This is all your fault.

320
00:31:25,649 --> 00:31:28,659
- Why? What did I do? - Because I take after you,

321
00:31:29,389 --> 00:31:32,528
I chose someone like my mom to fall in love with.

322
00:31:36,699 --> 00:31:41,468
My mom never smiled in front of you her whole life.

323
00:31:43,339 --> 00:31:46,909
But at the amusement park, she smiled only once.

324
00:31:49,038 --> 00:31:50,778
It was such a beautiful smile.

325
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:56,119
Just like my mom,

326
00:31:57,149 --> 00:31:59,018
Jae Hyun is as cold as ice.

327
00:32:01,258 --> 00:32:05,629
But he said that he was willing to give up everything for that woman.

328

That woman?

329
00:32:13,268 --> 00:32:14,899
I'm sure he smiled for her.

330
00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:18,369
Every single day.

331
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:23,949
I bet it was a beautiful smile.

332
00:32:34,018 --> 00:32:35,218
What about Seo Kyung?

00:32:44,768 --> 00:32:45,929
Can we talk?

336
00:32:48,468 --> 00:32:49,699
I'm done talking.

337
00:32:51,238 --> 00:32:53,008
I've done something.

338
00:32:53,568 --> 00:32:55,409
And I can't just sit back as if nothing happened.

339
00:32:55,538 --> 00:32:58,609
The video will never leak.

340
00:32:59,579 --> 00:33:01,879
Then, you won't have to be responsible for her.

341
00:33:02,778 --> 00:33:04,188
And nothing will change.

342
00:33:09,258 --> 00:33:11,858
Leave me alone. I feel nauseous.

- You work at a distribution center? - Yes.

344
00:33:22,099 --> 00:33:23,398
Isn't it hard?

345
00:33:24,269 --> 00:33:25,409
Yes, it is.

346
00:33:25,809 --> 00:33:28,409
I used to be a cashier, but now, I have to lift heavy things.

347
00:33:29,909 --> 00:33:31,449
Is it some kind of revenge?

348
00:33:32,108 --> 00:33:33,179
Probably.

349
00:33:33,749 --> 00:33:36,548
I have a permanent position, so I'm in the labor union.

350
00:33:36,749 --> 00:33:39,088
- So I like that. - That's a relief.

351
00:33:39,588 --> 00:33:40,688
What about you?

352
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:42,959
You're doing well, right?

353
00:33:43,659 --> 00:33:45,588
I'm doing really well.

354
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:47,628
Are you still busy?

355
00:33:49,199 --> 00:33:51,068
If we're not busy, it means trouble.

356
00:33:52,068 --> 00:33:53,168
That's true.

357
00:33:55,738 --> 00:33:58,438
By the way, I wanted to ask you for a favor.

358
00:33:58,438 --> 00:33:59,608
I'm not sure if you'll say yes.

359
00:34:00,238 --> 00:34:03,438
In our labor union, I'm in charge of the culture team.

360
00:34:03,579 --> 00:34:05,209
So we're doing a culture festival.

361
00:34:05,579 --> 00:34:07,679
No one can play the keyboard.

362
00:34:08,249 --> 00:34:11,119
And I thought about you right away.

363
00:34:12,488 --> 00:34:14,318
Can I still play even if I'm not in the union?

364
00:34:14,318 --> 00:34:16,858
Of course. We invite a lot of people from outside.

365
00:34:17,289 --> 00:34:20,488
- I'll do it. - But it won't pay much.

366
00:34:21,028 --> 00:34:23,729
- You don't have to pay me. - No, you should get paid!

367
00:34:24,168 --> 00:34:26,798
I wanted to donate my talent.

368

are in the lobby for their second raid.

They have another warrant.

373
00:34:43,619 --> 00:34:45,119
They brought a subpoena for you.

374
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:46,988
Things look really intense.

375
00:34:47,588 --> 00:34:49,019
Is something going wrong?

376
00:34:49,218 --> 00:34:51,889
If they want me, I must go diligently and cooperate.

377
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:53,829
You seem so calm. That's making me more anxious.

What if you get imprisoned again?

Can't you call the police and arrest all of them?

394

She's the one playing the keyboard.

Yes. The chairman wanted to see photos.

I'm telling you this as an executive of the company.

I don't want you to participate in an event like today's.

you don't have the right to tell me that because you're an executive.

Exactly. You're not an employee. Why were you there?

I always felt sorry because I felt like I ran away like a coward.

It made me feel like I wanted the world change without any effort.

This was only a small change, but I should still contribute.

And when he's the victim too.

460
00:40:42,779 --> 00:40:45,649
I wanted to publicize it back then...

I do want to go,

but I actually don't feel comfortable going.

476
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:09,359
I guess my husband met up with her because he's soft-hearted.

477
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:12,770
I guess he went easy on her when she cried...

478

because they went to the same school.

It's embarrassing,

481
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:21,580
but I'm telling you because it was making me frustrated.

482
00:42:21,779 --> 00:42:24,410
It's a good thing you told me.

483

It's not like I have any authority,

484

but I do have control over the mothers.

485

Anyway, I don't feel comfortable seeing Young Min's mother,

488

She's the one who is guilty.

Are you going to end up in jail again?

497
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:08,859
What are you, an honorary ambassador for jail?

498
00:43:08,859 --> 00:43:11,490
I was expecting this to come from the beginning.

499
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,430
That I might go to jail again.

500
00:43:14,859 --> 00:43:17,700
I wasn't afraid of it at all back then.

501
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:20,129
Well, the first time is always the hardest.

502
00:43:20,299 --> 00:43:21,540
But I am afraid now.

503
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,069
Why now?

504
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:25,109
That Ji Su might disappear.

505
00:43:26,709 --> 00:43:29,779
That something might happen to her while I'm away.

506
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:32,410
I'm sure...

507
00:43:33,549 --> 00:43:35,520
something like that can't happen twice.

508
00:43:37,879 --> 00:43:39,919
Why is your relationship so sad?

509
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:44,459
You two used to be so awfully pretty together...

510
00:43:45,129 --> 00:43:46,790
that it even made me wonder.

511
00:43:54,799 --> 00:43:56,200
(Open House Day)

512
00:43:59,939 --> 00:44:03,209
Hyun Woo! Good luck!

513
00:44:10,350 --> 00:44:12,319
Goodness, you're here!

514
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:13,419
I'm glad you came.

515
00:44:13,419 --> 00:44:15,020
- Come on in. - You look great.

516
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:16,459
You're so pretty.

517
00:44:30,169 --> 00:44:31,299
Ms. Yoon.

518
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:32,810
Yes?

519
00:44:33,169 --> 00:44:34,939
Do you have a moment?

520
00:44:35,379 --> 00:44:37,439
- Why? - I want to discuss something.

521
00:44:37,939 --> 00:44:39,549
All the other mothers will be there.

522
00:44:44,049 --> 00:44:45,850
- Really? - This is so good.

523
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:47,350
Come on in, Ms. Yoon.

524
00:45:01,470 --> 00:45:02,970
We already finished our lunch.

525
00:45:03,169 --> 00:45:04,439
Go ahead and order something.

526
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:05,669
I'm good.

527
00:45:05,669 --> 00:45:06,709
All right, then.

528
00:45:06,709 --> 00:45:09,279
We don't have much time, anyway. Let's speed this up.

529
00:45:09,709 --> 00:45:11,979
I know that you're going through a lot,

530
00:45:12,049 --> 00:45:14,250
but you crossed the line.

531
00:45:14,379 --> 00:45:15,779
Please get to the point.

532
00:45:15,779 --> 00:45:17,720
All right. The point.

533
00:45:17,979 --> 00:45:20,819
How could you hit on another student's parent?

534
00:45:21,859 --> 00:45:23,759
- Unbelievable. - How could she?

535
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:25,790
I heard that's how you stopped the School Violence Committee.

536
00:45:26,359 --> 00:45:29,060
I know you were desperate, but how could you take that road?

537
00:45:30,129 --> 00:45:31,600
If word gets out,

538
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:34,839
the school image will turn vulgar sooner or later.

539
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,799
A mother should at least have...

540
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:40,839
some dignity, shouldn't she?

541
00:45:41,169 --> 00:45:44,779
Can you even bring yourself to look at Young Min after acting like that?

542
00:45:44,779 --> 00:45:46,350
He might already know.

543
00:45:46,350 --> 00:45:47,879
Kids know everything these days.

544
00:45:48,379 --> 00:45:50,279
I heard you even lied about your husband being...

545
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:52,250
a famous lawyer in Gangnam.

546
00:45:52,919 --> 00:45:55,259
And you even attend protests after being fired from some supermarket.

547
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,520
How could you not even apologize...

548
00:45:57,759 --> 00:45:59,689
after lying to us like that?

549
00:45:59,830 --> 00:46:01,359
Go ahead and say something.

550
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:03,430
Don't just sit there like the cat got your tongue.

551
00:46:06,270 --> 00:46:08,129
I guess you failed to dig up this part.

552
00:46:08,370 --> 00:46:10,140
That I have a past record.

553
00:46:11,069 --> 00:46:13,240
A previous conviction of foul play.

554
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:17,810
It was a place just like this.

555
00:46:17,910 --> 00:46:19,250
It brings back memories.

556
00:46:19,850 --> 00:46:22,279
Are you threatening me?

557
00:46:22,450 --> 00:46:24,049
How dare you speak so disgustingly?

558
00:46:24,049 --> 00:46:25,350
I understand that you want to leech off of...

559
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:27,649
Jang Seo Kyung by acting like her slave,

560
00:46:28,759 --> 00:46:30,290
but you chose the wrong person to pick on.

561
00:46:30,959 --> 00:46:32,029
"Slave"?

562
00:46:32,459 --> 00:46:33,529
Why, you...

563
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:41,200
Don't bite me. I'll bite back.

564
00:46:41,370 --> 00:46:43,700
You got all your stories wrong,

565
00:46:43,870 --> 00:46:45,709
and I'll risk going to jail again...

566
00:46:45,939 --> 00:46:48,680
if you spread rumors to the kids too.

567
00:46:50,410 --> 00:46:51,680
- Goodness, ma'am! - Why, that...

568
00:47:01,419 --> 00:47:03,620
It doesn't look like she was picked on.

569
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:40,259
- Let's talk again later. - Yes, sir.

570
00:47:41,459 --> 00:47:43,629
You had a quiet way here today, didn't you?

571
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:45,500
You called me so suddenly,

572
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:47,430
so the lobby was empty.

573
00:47:48,129 --> 00:47:49,140
So far.

574
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:53,439
We do try to keep confidentiality every time we call you,

575
00:47:53,439 --> 00:47:56,339
but word gets out quickly here.

576
00:47:56,509 --> 00:47:58,680
I guess there are a lot of ears.

577
00:48:00,209 --> 00:48:01,850
Sir...

578
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:05,250
Things got complicated.

579
00:48:06,790 --> 00:48:09,290
I don't think we will be able to protect you...

580
00:48:10,189 --> 00:48:11,359
as a public interest informant.

581
00:48:16,229 --> 00:48:17,560
There are a lot of flaws in the law...

582
00:48:18,399 --> 00:48:21,169
regarding whistleblowing in our country.

583
00:48:21,569 --> 00:48:22,770
We may have a big net,

584
00:48:22,770 --> 00:48:25,169
but the mesh is just as big,

585
00:48:26,109 --> 00:48:28,379
so it's not easy catching a big fish.

586
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:30,609
This is not what you said last time.

587
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:33,310
I guess this isn't your choice?

588
00:48:33,350 --> 00:48:35,520
I guess at the moment,

589
00:48:35,979 --> 00:48:37,350
the fish is still stronger than the net.

590
00:48:37,649 --> 00:48:39,649
I guess I will have to go into the water...

591
00:48:40,950 --> 00:48:42,759
to catch the big fish.

592
00:48:43,189 --> 00:48:46,259
Are you saying there's more than the borrowed-name stakes?

593
00:48:47,830 --> 00:48:49,259
It's not just the stakes and tax...

594
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:51,299
that are the problem for that.

595
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:55,600
As we discussed before, we are looking into it,

596
00:48:55,970 --> 00:48:59,310
but we're dealing with a very widely hidden area,

597
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:01,740
and it's just as deep.

598
00:49:02,479 --> 00:49:03,640
I will help you out.

599
00:49:04,509 --> 00:49:05,609
Sir.

600
00:49:05,810 --> 00:49:08,379
I'm not the kind of person who sees only what I want to see.

601
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:10,819
I see as I see.

602
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:13,819
Once I see it, I play by the rules.

603
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:15,720
If we dig any deeper,

604
00:49:17,189 --> 00:49:20,060
things will get difficult for you too.

605
00:49:20,759 --> 00:49:21,899
What can I do?

606
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:25,100
I knew I would have to risk it from the beginning.

607
00:49:27,399 --> 00:49:28,439
You are...

608
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:30,700
one determined man.

609
00:49:33,069 --> 00:49:34,569
I have a lot to clear up,

610
00:49:36,479 --> 00:49:37,609
so let's get started.

611
00:49:37,979 --> 00:49:39,080
Thank you.

612
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:45,120
So when you say "borrowed-name stakes"...

613
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:46,620
- That is correct. - All right.

614
00:50:02,470 --> 00:50:04,399
How are you involved with the case?

615
00:50:04,399 --> 00:50:06,240
- Please give us a word! - How did it go, sir?

616
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,979
- How involved were you? - Give us a word, sir!

617
00:50:08,979 --> 00:50:11,240
We are ashamed of you!

- How involved were you? - Give us a word, sir!

623

What was the investigation on?

624
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:31,629
- Give us a word, sir! - What were your words?

625
00:50:31,970 --> 00:50:34,470
What will happen next?

who took his own life during the general strike...

630

of Hyung Sung Steel five years ago,

631
00:50:48,479 --> 00:50:50,649
filed a complaint against the vice-president...

of Hyung Sung Supermarket, Han Jae Hyun.

633
00:50:52,649 --> 00:50:54,149
We want to reveal that...

634
00:50:54,149 --> 00:50:56,819
the death of Kwon Hyuk Soo was not an accident...

635
00:50:57,390 --> 00:50:59,459
due to personal reasons, but a tragic sacrifice...

636
00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:02,029

within the company for business rationalization,

640
00:51:09,169 --> 00:51:11,870
and he is the key suspect.

The lawyer who filed the complaint today is Lee Se Hun.

643
00:51:20,209 --> 00:51:22,549
I guess this is the best way for each other.

663
00:53:41,350 --> 00:53:42,459
Amen.

664
00:53:42,819 --> 00:53:44,390
May the Lord be with you.

665
00:53:47,930 --> 00:53:49,200
Follow her.

666
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:56,839
The body of Christ.

667
00:53:58,169 --> 00:53:59,209
Amen.

668
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:12,919
The asyli had been trampled on.

669
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:17,520
"The asyli"?

670
00:54:18,830 --> 00:54:20,790
It means asylum in Latin.

671
00:54:21,529 --> 00:54:24,660
Even criminals and fugitives can't be arrested when they are in it.

672
00:54:25,970 --> 00:54:27,770
But they did today.

673
00:54:29,370 --> 00:54:31,600
Then I will be your asyli.

674
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:36,879
I will hide you away whenever you come to me.

675
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:38,379
So that no one can take you away.

676
00:54:43,419 --> 00:54:45,279
We will be okay here.

677
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:48,520
If we're here,

678
00:54:50,089 --> 00:54:51,560
we will be okay.

679
00:54:58,330 --> 00:54:59,370
Gosh.

680
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:02,200
You're using that line often.

681
00:55:05,410 --> 00:55:09,979
(Monthly Wednesday Mass)

682
00:55:12,379 --> 00:55:13,580
The body of Christ.

683
00:55:37,799 --> 00:55:39,640
I saw that Leon was still there.

684
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:44,040
I guess someone kept taking care of it.

685
00:55:47,410 --> 00:55:50,049
I wonder how that happened.

686
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:54,290
Actually, that's not Leon.

687
00:55:55,459 --> 00:55:56,490
Right?

688
00:55:57,419 --> 00:55:58,490
No wonder.

689
00:56:00,629 --> 00:56:04,160
I planted it not long ago. On purpose.

690
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:07,700
Right here.

691
00:56:23,450 --> 00:56:24,520
I forgot.

692
00:56:26,089 --> 00:56:27,390
What this place was.

693
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:34,160
It's the asyli,

694
00:56:37,029 --> 00:56:39,700
so no one can see us or find us,

695
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:44,140
so just for a while.

696
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:07,560
I was afraid of being held back by the past,

697
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:11,930
so I kept walking forward without looking back,

698
00:57:14,870 --> 00:57:16,970
but I realized that I was always at this place.

699
00:57:20,009 --> 00:57:21,169
Maybe...

700
00:57:22,879 --> 00:57:25,240
I had been walking here all this time.

701
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:29,379
Now, my legs hurt,

702
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:35,419
and I just want to stay today.

703
00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:40,189
Because if we're here,

704
00:57:44,529 --> 00:57:46,029
we will be okay.

705
00:58:12,290 --> 00:58:15,459
(I had been spending my life waiting for you,)

706
00:58:15,459 --> 00:58:18,330
(and my heart had been...)

707
00:58:18,330 --> 00:58:22,240
(the sound of your footsteps.)

708
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:27,140
("The Footsteps", by Paul Valery)

709
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:48,060
(When My Love Blooms)

710
00:58:49,129 --> 00:58:51,899
I'm not sure. What the truth is...

711
00:58:53,229 --> 00:58:54,669
or what's right.

712
00:58:55,299 --> 00:58:56,770
I'll confirm it for you.

713
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:58,740
What Han Jae Hyun did.

714
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:02,479
It's a matter of survival, so you should decide for yourself.

715
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:05,879
It must be because you've changed.

716
00:59:07,209 --> 00:59:08,850
You're very similar.

717
00:59:09,149 --> 00:59:11,450
Haven't you heard about me from your father?

718
00:59:11,649 --> 00:59:13,220
You said you were curious, right?

719
00:59:14,089 --> 00:59:15,549
About why I left.
