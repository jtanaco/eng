00:00:06,693 --> 00:00:08,163
(Episode 11)

2
00:00:12,903 --> 00:00:16,572
When you suffer an illness due to a psychological scar,

3
00:00:16,572 --> 00:00:18,743
you call it a psychogenic illness.

4
00:00:46,162 --> 00:00:47,632
A psychogenic illness...

5
00:00:48,073 --> 00:00:49,903
is developed through a mental...

6
00:00:49,933 --> 00:00:52,302
or psychological issue.

7
00:00:52,772 --> 00:00:54,713
When you're put in the same traumatic situation,

8
00:00:55,012 --> 00:00:57,812
you feel the urge to avoid it or become hesitant.

9
00:01:02,283 --> 00:01:05,552
When you run, your body lets out adrenaline...

10
00:01:05,652 --> 00:01:07,552
which gets rid of your gloominess.

11
00:01:08,822 --> 00:01:10,292
And just like that, some scientists say...

12
00:01:10,563 --> 00:01:12,363
psychogenic illnesses can be treated...

13
00:01:12,462 --> 00:01:16,533
by examining the neural circuits in our brain...

14
00:01:16,533 --> 00:01:18,333
or the chemical compositions.

15
00:01:20,162 --> 00:01:22,233
But that's not how the human mind works...

16
00:01:22,302 --> 00:01:26,042
even if all the chemical reactions in our body are in a normal state.

17
00:01:27,173 --> 00:01:29,412
We're not like computers.

18
00:01:31,182 --> 00:01:35,412
What we feel in our hearts is a product...

19
00:01:35,753 --> 00:01:40,253
of everything we experience in life...

20
00:01:40,253 --> 00:01:42,623
such as love, pain, loss,

21
00:01:43,052 --> 00:01:46,723
anger, violence, peace, and happiness.

22
00:01:46,763 --> 00:01:53,533
In between a deep mountain valley

23
00:01:53,632 --> 00:02:00,042
There is a small well that holds clear water

24
00:02:00,873 --> 00:02:06,783
And among the beautiful flowers

25
00:02:07,052 --> 00:02:10,823
Gosh, why are you singing facing the ground?

26
00:02:11,853 --> 00:02:13,052
Come here.

27
00:02:13,052 --> 00:02:14,122
What is it?

28
00:02:14,652 --> 00:02:15,853
Isn't it so cool?

29
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:20,062
I can't believe a flower bloomed here.

30
00:02:20,062 --> 00:02:22,363
I sang to it hoping it'll grow well.

31
00:02:22,462 --> 00:02:23,532
I see.

32
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:27,902
My goodness, that's enough. Now, get up.

33
00:02:28,472 --> 00:02:29,802
You need to come here early tomorrow.

34
00:02:29,802 --> 00:02:30,842
Why?

35
00:02:31,272 --> 00:02:32,603
You lost your job at the hospital.

36
00:02:32,742 --> 00:02:34,342
Starting from tomorrow, I want you to work part-time.

37
00:02:34,342 --> 00:02:36,413
- All of a sudden? - You got fired from the hospital.

38
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:40,353
You might get sick if you're suddenly free all day.

39
00:02:42,052 --> 00:02:44,152
There's only one way to free yourself...

40
00:02:44,152 --> 00:02:46,282
- Forget it if you don't want to. - from a psychogenic illness.

41
00:02:47,522 --> 00:02:49,622
- Come on. - And that is...

42
00:02:49,622 --> 00:02:51,122
to face your fears.

43
00:02:56,733 --> 00:02:58,402
In order to escape from darkness,

44
00:02:59,432 --> 00:03:02,573
you must walk into the darkness and face it.

45
00:03:05,242 --> 00:03:08,043
And you start by saying goodbye...

46
00:03:08,443 --> 00:03:10,682
to all the hurtful memories.

47
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:35,662
(Gongbap Restaurant)

48
00:04:46,143 --> 00:04:49,212
I find myself constantly waiting for him.

49
00:04:49,712 --> 00:04:51,383
"Is he not going to come for lunch?"

50
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:55,212
"I wonder if he'll drop by for a drink after work."

51
00:04:55,282 --> 00:04:57,323
If you're so curious, why don't you just call?

52
00:04:57,453 --> 00:04:59,083
It's not like you guys had a huge fight.

53
00:05:00,553 --> 00:05:01,792
I'm scared he might notice.

54
00:05:02,152 --> 00:05:03,222
Notice what?

55
00:05:03,422 --> 00:05:04,522
My feelings for him.

56
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,022
I think...

57
00:05:08,162 --> 00:05:09,563
I like him.

58
00:05:10,902 --> 00:05:13,162
But I'm pretty sure I don't actually like him.

59
00:05:13,902 --> 00:05:16,272
I have trouble controlling my feelings.

60
00:05:16,272 --> 00:05:18,042
That's probably why I'm feeling this way.

61
00:05:18,503 --> 00:05:20,102
What makes you think you like him?

62
00:05:20,573 --> 00:05:21,972
It feels like...

63
00:05:23,943 --> 00:05:25,583
losing love...

64
00:05:26,212 --> 00:05:28,313
when I was never in love.

65
00:05:29,383 --> 00:05:31,282
I haven't seen him for just a few days,

66
00:05:31,282 --> 00:05:32,683
and I miss him so much.

67
00:05:34,352 --> 00:05:35,753
I think of him all day.

68
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:39,862
I thought I just had anger management issues,

69
00:05:39,862 --> 00:05:41,092
but I have this problem too.

70
00:05:42,263 --> 00:05:43,263
Doctor.

71
00:05:44,532 --> 00:05:46,362
What do you think is wrong with me?

72
00:05:48,172 --> 00:05:51,172
Liking someone isn't a problem.

73
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:54,172
Don't try to deny it.

74
00:05:54,472 --> 00:05:56,412
Look into yourself as if you're a mirror.

75
00:05:56,972 --> 00:05:59,042
Do you really like him,

76
00:05:59,042 --> 00:06:01,482
or is it just a feeling of abandonment...

77
00:06:01,482 --> 00:06:03,982
because you relied on him and can't see him anymore?

78
00:06:06,652 --> 00:06:08,022
"A feeling of abandonment"?

79
00:06:08,092 --> 00:06:10,292
If you suddenly feel lost or discarded,

80
00:06:10,493 --> 00:06:12,662
you look for someone to lean on.

81
00:06:14,763 --> 00:06:15,962
Could that be it?

82
00:06:20,102 --> 00:06:21,232
But...

83
00:06:22,232 --> 00:06:23,672
what if this is real?

84
00:06:24,743 --> 00:06:26,573
Then can I like him?

85
00:06:28,712 --> 00:06:32,612
Does someone like me have the right to like someone?

86
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:36,152
Why does one need the right to like someone else?

87
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:01,743
Dr. Lee.

88
00:07:02,513 --> 00:07:03,883
I can go home.

89
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:05,743
Are you happy about it?

90
00:07:07,912 --> 00:07:09,612
Where is your mother?

91
00:07:09,712 --> 00:07:10,953
Sorting out the paperwork.

92
00:07:11,253 --> 00:07:12,652
She said she'd be back soon.

93
00:07:13,422 --> 00:07:14,493
Did she?

94
00:07:14,592 --> 00:07:17,893
Shall we go out for a short walk before she gets back?

95
00:07:22,133 --> 00:07:23,902
Where are you taking Luo?

96
00:07:24,232 --> 00:07:25,803
His mother will be back soon.

97
00:07:26,102 --> 00:07:27,102
Exactly.

98
00:07:27,203 --> 00:07:30,133
She'll be back soon, so we won't be long ourselves.

99
00:07:30,232 --> 00:07:33,602
Dr. Lee. You know I'm responsible for everything that...

100
00:07:33,602 --> 00:07:35,313
happens in this ward, don't you?

101
00:07:36,772 --> 00:07:38,143
I just want to...

102
00:07:38,143 --> 00:07:40,852
take him for a short walk to say goodbye.

103
00:07:42,112 --> 00:07:44,623
- Say goodbye here. - I gave my permission.

104
00:07:47,922 --> 00:07:51,362
Dr. Lee's taking him outside with my permission as Luo's doctor.

105
00:07:51,393 --> 00:07:53,393
Must you be like this too?

106
00:07:53,592 --> 00:07:54,633
Go ahead.

107
00:07:57,433 --> 00:07:58,503
Thank you.

108
00:08:03,032 --> 00:08:04,803
You never gave permission.

109
00:08:05,042 --> 00:08:06,972
Did you think I couldn't tell?

110
00:08:08,073 --> 00:08:09,373
You know his mother is...

111
00:08:09,373 --> 00:08:11,443
just looking for an excuse to bring up the taser incident.

112
00:08:11,443 --> 00:08:13,583
I will talk to Luo's mother.

113
00:08:18,782 --> 00:08:21,053
My late mother was...

114
00:08:21,852 --> 00:08:23,652
very interested in my education.

115
00:08:24,592 --> 00:08:25,662
She wanted me...

116
00:08:26,693 --> 00:08:28,662
to attend a famous after-school class in Daechi-dong.

117
00:08:29,563 --> 00:08:31,162
So I could befriend rich kids...

118
00:08:33,462 --> 00:08:34,833
and go to a good university.

119
00:08:38,573 --> 00:08:40,673
But that was impossible for a kid like me...

120
00:08:42,472 --> 00:08:43,982
from the outskirts of the city.

121
00:08:45,742 --> 00:08:47,382
So my mother thought of...

122
00:08:48,712 --> 00:08:50,612
getting an insurance payout.

123
00:08:54,122 --> 00:08:57,923
My maternal grandmother had a grassy garden in Gimpo.

124
00:08:59,023 --> 00:09:03,132
That afternoon, my mom mowed the lawn with a machine...

125
00:09:06,362 --> 00:09:07,573
and cut off her toes.

126
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:10,703
She got treated right away,

127
00:09:11,403 --> 00:09:14,642
but we couldn't find one toe.

128
00:09:15,842 --> 00:09:19,283
You have no idea how much I cried all night...

129
00:09:20,443 --> 00:09:22,252
as I looked for her toe.

130
00:09:23,553 --> 00:09:27,252
I realized that day just how strong and sharp...

131
00:09:28,423 --> 00:09:29,523
grass can be.

132
00:09:30,823 --> 00:09:32,923
We moved to Daechi-dong with the insurance money.

133
00:09:33,663 --> 00:09:34,693
Why...

134
00:09:35,462 --> 00:09:38,762
are you telling me this?

135
00:09:41,573 --> 00:09:42,602
I sometimes,

136
00:09:44,002 --> 00:09:48,313
even now, have nightmares about looking for my mom's toe.

137
00:09:50,472 --> 00:09:51,813
She's dead now,

138
00:09:53,313 --> 00:09:54,783
but the nightmares still plague me.

139
00:09:56,112 --> 00:09:58,153
I got the feeling that Luo...

140
00:09:58,482 --> 00:10:02,592
might suffer from nightmares for the rest of his life, like me.

141
00:10:03,122 --> 00:10:04,462
That's why I told you that.

142
00:10:27,512 --> 00:10:28,512
Luo.

143
00:10:29,482 --> 00:10:30,583
Do you hear the wind?

144
00:10:32,953 --> 00:10:34,722
Yes. I do.

145
00:10:35,992 --> 00:10:37,053
How does it sound?

146
00:10:38,962 --> 00:10:39,962
It sounds warm.

147
00:10:40,793 --> 00:10:42,462
You're right. It's a warm sound.

148
00:10:44,533 --> 00:10:45,602
It's cozy.

149
00:10:47,773 --> 00:10:49,303
Do you feel it surround you?

150
00:10:52,573 --> 00:10:54,372
Yes. I feel it.

151
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:59,342
Do you hear the sound of leaves rustling?

152
00:11:01,053 --> 00:11:02,112
I do.

153
00:11:03,382 --> 00:11:04,982
What about the swaying grass?

154
00:11:06,923 --> 00:11:07,992
I hear it.

155
00:11:09,722 --> 00:11:10,722
Luo.

156
00:11:13,392 --> 00:11:17,232
In this world, there are good sounds and bad sounds.

157
00:11:18,163 --> 00:11:19,903
There are real sounds and fakes.

158
00:11:20,303 --> 00:11:21,433
Remember that.

159
00:11:22,502 --> 00:11:26,943
The sounds you heard just now are good sounds and real ones.

160
00:11:29,012 --> 00:11:32,112
They are sounds that make you feel warm and cozy.

161
00:11:34,313 --> 00:11:36,482
Sounds that torment and torture you...

162
00:11:37,112 --> 00:11:38,882
are bad and fake sounds.

163
00:11:40,823 --> 00:11:44,462
Like the voices I hear in my ear?

164
00:11:44,892 --> 00:11:47,492
You know those voices are fake, don't you?

165
00:11:50,862 --> 00:11:53,803
Now, listen only to true, real sounds.

166
00:11:53,803 --> 00:11:54,933
Forget the fake ones.

167
00:11:56,872 --> 00:11:59,502
- Will you remember that? - I promise.

168
00:12:04,742 --> 00:12:07,283
A sound changed a life.

169
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:12,823
- Go home, returnee! - Go home, returnee!

170
00:12:12,882 --> 00:12:15,923
- Go home, returnee! - Go home, returnee!

171
00:12:16,023 --> 00:12:18,563
That one phrase broke a boy's soul.

172
00:12:20,462 --> 00:12:23,293
The wind caressed the broken soul.

173
00:12:40,683 --> 00:12:44,482
Another sound woke up a depressed soul.

174
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:54,063
Luo.

175
00:12:56,762 --> 00:12:58,333
This is my secret.

176
00:12:59,533 --> 00:13:00,602
The truth is,

177
00:13:02,273 --> 00:13:05,842
I also hear an endless sound in my ear.

178
00:13:06,602 --> 00:13:08,372
Like a beating drum.

179
00:13:10,642 --> 00:13:13,112
Is it a cozy sound? Is it warm?

180
00:13:15,683 --> 00:13:16,712
Very much so.

181
00:13:32,462 --> 00:13:34,602
(Gongbap Restaurant)

182
00:13:42,242 --> 00:13:43,342
Come on!

183
00:13:47,982 --> 00:13:49,212
- Ms. Gong. - What?

184
00:13:49,212 --> 00:13:50,553
Buy me a beer.

185
00:13:50,982 --> 00:13:53,923
- What? - Please! Please!

186
00:13:54,622 --> 00:13:55,622
How much beer?

187
00:13:56,622 --> 00:13:59,092
How do you think Si Joon feels right now?

188
00:14:00,193 --> 00:14:02,862
I'm sure he has a lot on his mind.

189
00:14:03,862 --> 00:14:05,462
He gave up on a patient.

190
00:14:06,063 --> 00:14:10,073
Woo Joo said that she likes Si Joon.

191
00:14:11,242 --> 00:14:13,642
- It's transference. - I think so too.

192
00:14:13,872 --> 00:14:17,842
That is why he didn't want to take on a borderline patient.

193
00:14:19,012 --> 00:14:21,583
What if it's not transference and she really likes him?

194
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:23,612
Are you afraid he'll fall for her?

195
00:14:24,212 --> 00:14:25,923
He fell for his patient once.

196
00:14:25,923 --> 00:14:28,423
Si Joon's not the kind to be so reckless.

197
00:14:36,663 --> 00:14:38,533
Do you know what I've been thinking...

198
00:14:38,533 --> 00:14:40,232
ever since Woo Joo confessed that to me?

199
00:14:41,472 --> 00:14:43,472
"What if it happens again?"

200
00:14:49,612 --> 00:14:50,872
I knew about it.

201
00:14:51,943 --> 00:14:54,813
That Se Yeon was in a bad condition eight years ago.

202
00:14:56,183 --> 00:14:59,482
But I didn't tell Si Joon out of jealousy.

203
00:15:00,823 --> 00:15:03,592
Se Yeon relied on me so much.

204
00:15:09,362 --> 00:15:12,303
I bet no one is as bad a loser as I am.

205
00:15:12,563 --> 00:15:17,102
I knew that you knew that and didn't tell Si Joon.

206
00:15:17,673 --> 00:15:18,803
I knew all along.

207
00:15:20,142 --> 00:15:22,313
I'm even worse than you, aren't I?

208
00:15:27,752 --> 00:15:28,882
These days,

209
00:15:30,413 --> 00:15:32,823
I feel the urge to tell Si Joon how I feel about him.

210
00:15:34,153 --> 00:15:37,823
It makes me wonder if I might be able to get a chance with him.

211
00:15:54,512 --> 00:15:57,673
The inner-circle train for...

212
00:15:57,673 --> 00:16:00,683
Seoul National University of Education is approaching.

213
00:16:01,482 --> 00:16:03,653
The inner-circle train for...

214
00:16:04,313 --> 00:16:08,293
Seoul National University of Education is approaching.

215
00:16:12,663 --> 00:16:13,862
What are you doing?

216
00:16:19,002 --> 00:16:21,002
Were you secretly filming her legs?

217
00:16:24,903 --> 00:16:26,842
- Excuse me. Hey. - Yes?

218
00:16:26,842 --> 00:16:28,872
He secretly took a video of your legs...

219
00:16:28,872 --> 00:16:30,913
- Move. Move it. - Oh my gosh!

220
00:16:31,012 --> 00:16:32,283
He secretly took a video of you!

221
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:34,112
- Move! - My gosh!

222
00:16:34,112 --> 00:16:35,382
He's a thief!

223
00:16:35,382 --> 00:16:37,653
Thief! He's a thief!

224
00:16:40,382 --> 00:16:41,392
My goodness.

225
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:45,023
He's a thief!

226
00:16:45,092 --> 00:16:47,722
- Let me go! - Where do you think you're going?

227
00:16:47,722 --> 00:16:49,833
- Stop him. - What's going on?

228
00:16:50,762 --> 00:16:53,102
I'm not a thief! I'm not!

229
00:16:53,102 --> 00:16:55,102
He's not a thief. He secretly recorded a video of a woman.

230
00:16:55,102 --> 00:16:56,132
- What? - He secretly took a video?

231
00:16:56,132 --> 00:16:57,372
Check his cell phone.

232
00:16:57,372 --> 00:16:58,543
Give me your cell phone.

233
00:16:58,543 --> 00:17:00,203
Take it out, sir.

234
00:17:03,573 --> 00:17:05,612
My gosh, how shocking.

235
00:17:06,043 --> 00:17:08,352
I can't believe the best heart surgeon in our country...

236
00:17:08,352 --> 00:17:09,612
turned out to be a pervert.

237
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:10,612
This is crazy.

238
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:13,223
I was the one who caught him, so I was even more shocked.

239
00:17:13,852 --> 00:17:15,493
I almost fainted.

240
00:17:16,323 --> 00:17:18,563
I even took one of his classes.

241
00:17:19,192 --> 00:17:21,063
He didn't look like a guy who'd do something like that.

242
00:17:22,392 --> 00:17:24,362
Maybe there was a misunderstanding.

243
00:17:25,102 --> 00:17:27,602
They found dozens of photos in his cell phone.

244
00:17:27,702 --> 00:17:29,902
And he even uploaded them on a porn site for doctors.

245
00:17:30,803 --> 00:17:33,573
The cardio department of that hospital is in a panic.

246
00:17:33,773 --> 00:17:36,912
Gosh, this is going to destroy his career.

247
00:17:37,112 --> 00:17:39,142
Do you think he'll lose his medical license?

248
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:41,513
Over 1,000 doctors apparently signed up for a membership...

249
00:17:41,513 --> 00:17:42,983
on the porn site called "Doc SC".

250
00:17:43,783 --> 00:17:45,682
"SC" stands for "secret camera."

251
00:17:45,922 --> 00:17:48,493
And "Doc" stands for "doctor."

252
00:17:48,493 --> 00:17:49,823
Unbelievable.

253
00:17:50,122 --> 00:17:52,692
Why would they waste their brains on doing something like this?

254
00:17:53,692 --> 00:17:56,892
But Doc SC is pretty famous among our colleagues.

255
00:17:57,293 --> 00:17:58,503
- What? - What?

256
00:18:01,303 --> 00:18:03,533
My gosh, what a bunch of perverts.

257
00:18:04,642 --> 00:18:07,202
All the hospitals are in an emergency.

258
00:18:07,402 --> 00:18:11,073
Aren't you best friends with Dr. Park in Cardiology?

259
00:18:11,142 --> 00:18:14,583
You used to boast about him all the time.

260
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:18,882
My goodness, that's not true. We're not best friends.

261
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,652
He's just an acquaintance.

262
00:18:23,023 --> 00:18:26,023
I heard there are over 1,000 members on that website.

263
00:18:26,023 --> 00:18:27,963
So I looked into it.

264
00:18:28,692 --> 00:18:31,033
And it turns out some of them even work at our hospital.

265
00:18:31,132 --> 00:18:32,362
How many?

266
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:35,033
We found 22 so far.

267
00:18:35,902 --> 00:18:36,932
What should we do?

268
00:18:37,303 --> 00:18:40,942
I think it's best for the patients to have them fired...

269
00:18:41,313 --> 00:18:42,842
before the cops start investigating.

270
00:18:42,942 --> 00:18:45,483
We need a good enough reason to fire them.

271
00:18:46,112 --> 00:18:48,483
So why don't we wait until the investigation begins?

272
00:18:48,852 --> 00:18:50,912
This is irrelevant to whether or not they get punished by law.

273
00:18:51,382 --> 00:18:54,182
I don't want people like them treating our patients.

274
00:18:54,692 --> 00:18:55,692
Let's just have them dismissed.

275
00:18:55,952 --> 00:18:57,352
Ma'am.

276
00:18:57,352 --> 00:19:00,223
Paraphilia is a very serious psychological disorder.

277
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:03,162
We're even building a Medical Psychiatry Center.

278
00:19:03,263 --> 00:19:07,303
We shouldn't approach this like other hospitals and fire people.

279
00:19:07,303 --> 00:19:09,003
So what do you think we should do?

280
00:19:09,303 --> 00:19:12,602
Even if we fire them, I personally think...

281
00:19:12,642 --> 00:19:15,043
we should have them treated first.

282
00:19:15,473 --> 00:19:18,182
That way, we'll be able to prevent future crimes.

283
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:22,652
It's true that paraphilia can eventually lead to serious problems.

284
00:19:26,523 --> 00:19:27,783
We are going to carry out...

285
00:19:28,753 --> 00:19:31,963
a group counseling session for those with paraphilia.

286
00:19:32,892 --> 00:19:34,793
Among all the members of that illegal site,

287
00:19:34,793 --> 00:19:36,763
22 of them turned out to be working at our hospital.

288
00:19:37,132 --> 00:19:39,902
And among them, eight people seem to have voyeurism.

289
00:19:39,902 --> 00:19:41,573
They are the ones we will be treating.

290
00:19:41,672 --> 00:19:44,033
Sir, did they agree to get treated?

291
00:19:44,132 --> 00:19:46,473
No, they don't know anything yet.

292
00:19:46,573 --> 00:19:48,243
We need to approach them and convince them.

293
00:19:48,313 --> 00:19:51,882
But this is such a sensitive issue. I don't think they'll get treated.

294
00:19:52,013 --> 00:19:54,283
None of them are going to admit that they have voyeurism.

295
00:19:54,382 --> 00:19:55,852
Do your best to convince them.

296
00:19:55,952 --> 00:19:57,882
Blackmail them or lie to them if you need to.

297
00:19:57,882 --> 00:19:59,283
You're good at that.

298
00:20:00,652 --> 00:20:03,223
You talk as if I'm a gangster.

299
00:20:03,523 --> 00:20:05,793
Plus, I haven't received any outpatients for a while.

300
00:20:05,892 --> 00:20:07,922
So I have tons of patients waiting to get treated.

301
00:20:09,733 --> 00:20:12,263
We need to be extra careful and make sure...

302
00:20:12,263 --> 00:20:16,273
their information doesn't leak. You know that, right?

303
00:20:16,273 --> 00:20:17,303
- Yes. - Yes.

304
00:20:18,142 --> 00:20:20,172
- And Dr. Kang. - Yes?

305
00:20:20,303 --> 00:20:21,303
You will get to have...

306
00:20:22,872 --> 00:20:24,112
your first patient.

307
00:20:26,213 --> 00:20:27,213
Really?

308
00:20:28,283 --> 00:20:30,013
You're a real doctor now.

309
00:20:31,013 --> 00:20:32,823
Congratulations. Good luck.

310
00:20:33,682 --> 00:20:35,592
Noo Ri, you caught a pervert at the subway station.

311
00:20:35,592 --> 00:20:38,192
And now, you even get to treat your first patient.

312
00:20:38,563 --> 00:20:40,223
It's like you were destined for this.

313
00:20:41,592 --> 00:20:44,392
It's like the skies are telling me to do a good job.

314
00:20:44,662 --> 00:20:45,902
I won't take this chance for granted.

315
00:20:46,362 --> 00:20:47,362
Okay.

316
00:20:53,372 --> 00:20:55,872
We're psychiatrists.

317
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:58,142
I will be telling you the names of our patients.

318
00:20:58,412 --> 00:21:02,182
Do not think of them as perverted colleagues.

319
00:21:02,182 --> 00:21:04,313
You must think of them as patients who have voyeurism.

320
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:07,223
Please don't ever forget that.

321
00:21:08,122 --> 00:21:10,452
Okay then. Here's the first patient.

322
00:21:11,392 --> 00:21:12,763
When the patient got here,

323
00:21:13,392 --> 00:21:16,463
I heard he was able to communicate by writing things down.

324
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:21,132
What did you do to cause a cardiac arrest in just one hour?

325
00:21:21,402 --> 00:21:25,202
That means you guys didn't give him proper first aid.

326
00:21:25,642 --> 00:21:27,402
He said he couldn't breathe properly.

327
00:21:27,642 --> 00:21:30,672
So I did a tracheotomy and freed his airway.

328
00:21:30,713 --> 00:21:32,283
His vitals were fine.

329
00:21:32,412 --> 00:21:35,652
And he could even talk to us before you came.

330
00:21:37,112 --> 00:21:39,452
But he had severely hurt his chest,

331
00:21:39,652 --> 00:21:42,192
so I kept calling you for surgery.

332
00:21:42,723 --> 00:21:43,723
But...

333
00:21:44,823 --> 00:21:46,993
you came over an hour later.

334
00:21:47,463 --> 00:21:49,092
So are you blaming it on me?

335
00:21:50,362 --> 00:21:51,362
Is that what you're saying?

336
00:21:51,932 --> 00:21:54,503
Tell me. Is it my fault?

337
00:21:56,372 --> 00:21:57,372
No, sir.

338
00:21:57,503 --> 00:22:00,073
The patient is brain dead.

339
00:22:00,503 --> 00:22:01,543
What are you going to do?

340
00:22:03,013 --> 00:22:04,043
I'm sorry.

341
00:22:22,592 --> 00:22:23,932
It's okay.

342
00:22:23,932 --> 00:22:25,432
You look really tired.

343
00:22:25,902 --> 00:22:27,463
Here. Take it.

344
00:22:27,803 --> 00:22:29,632
Oh, okay. Thanks.

345
00:22:32,803 --> 00:22:35,213
I'm Dr. Lee Si Joon. I'm in Psychiatry.

346
00:22:35,213 --> 00:22:36,243
Hello.

347
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:45,483
Do you have something to say to me?

348
00:22:49,622 --> 00:22:51,692
Do you know Doc SC?

349
00:22:53,592 --> 00:22:54,833
You're a member there, aren't you?

350
00:22:58,862 --> 00:22:59,932
How did you know?

351
00:22:59,932 --> 00:23:01,333
That doesn't matter.

352
00:23:01,773 --> 00:23:03,402
I'll just cut to the chase.

353
00:23:04,003 --> 00:23:06,142
People don't know this very well.

354
00:23:06,402 --> 00:23:11,043
But voyeurism is a severe psychological disorder.

355
00:23:11,583 --> 00:23:14,382
So I'd like to offer some help.

356
00:23:17,412 --> 00:23:19,083
What are you trying to do?

357
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:21,452
I don't know who told you this.

358
00:23:21,892 --> 00:23:23,192
But don't treat me like a pervert.

359
00:23:23,192 --> 00:23:25,493
I only saw it a few times just for fun.

360
00:23:25,493 --> 00:23:28,293
I already went to the police station this morning and got investigated.

361
00:23:28,392 --> 00:23:29,733
I only did it...

362
00:23:31,192 --> 00:23:33,003
I only did it out of curiosity.

363
00:23:33,102 --> 00:23:34,102
But you have...

364
00:23:35,102 --> 00:23:36,233
a gold membership.

365
00:23:36,503 --> 00:23:37,632
Darn it.

366
00:23:42,573 --> 00:23:46,342
That's because I shared my ID and password with my colleagues.

367
00:23:47,412 --> 00:23:49,152
Do I really need to explain this to you?

368
00:23:49,182 --> 00:23:50,652
You don't need to explain.

369
00:23:50,652 --> 00:23:53,283
You'll end up getting sued anyway.

370
00:23:53,283 --> 00:23:55,422
- What? - But even so,

371
00:23:55,422 --> 00:23:57,422
I'm still willing to treat you.

372
00:23:58,192 --> 00:24:00,793
I'll keep everything confidential, so don't worry.

373
00:24:03,892 --> 00:24:05,763
(New Post Uploaded)

374
00:24:26,053 --> 00:24:27,422
(New Post Uploaded)

375
00:24:54,842 --> 00:24:56,213
What are you doing?

376
00:24:56,652 --> 00:24:58,753
My goodness, I got your face too.

377
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:03,293
I told you. Voyeurism is an illness.

378
00:25:03,723 --> 00:25:06,362
You can try all you want, but it's an addiction.

379
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:08,122
You need more than a strong will to stop.

380
00:25:08,122 --> 00:25:10,463
I'll treat you and keep things confidential.

381
00:25:12,033 --> 00:25:14,803
So when should we start?

382
00:25:15,573 --> 00:25:17,632
Voyeurism is a serious illness.

383
00:25:17,932 --> 00:25:20,073
Just get treated before things get worse.

384
00:25:20,642 --> 00:25:21,642
Come on.

385
00:25:21,642 --> 00:25:23,412
You're talking to the wrong person.

386
00:25:23,642 --> 00:25:25,142
What do you take me for?

387
00:25:26,142 --> 00:25:27,213
Don't you get it?

388
00:25:27,942 --> 00:25:29,513
Do you want to end your career?

389
00:25:29,713 --> 00:25:31,253
I told you. You're mistaken.

390
00:25:35,223 --> 00:25:36,553
You pathetic jerk.

391
00:25:37,293 --> 00:25:38,692
Did you have nothing better to do?

392
00:25:39,392 --> 00:25:41,523
I can't believe you're a member on that site.

393
00:25:41,993 --> 00:25:44,533
Be grateful that the hospital is willing to treat you.

394
00:25:44,963 --> 00:25:47,533
- Just get treated, okay? - I don't know why I did that.

395
00:25:47,733 --> 00:25:50,233
What's going to happen to me?

396
00:25:50,932 --> 00:25:54,202
Can you please help me get better? Please.

397
00:25:54,442 --> 00:25:56,872
It can get treated. I promise.

398
00:25:57,073 --> 00:25:58,112
Sang Joon.

399
00:25:58,513 --> 00:26:01,182
Trust us and receive the treatment.

400
00:26:01,513 --> 00:26:03,753
It's just a psychological disorder.

401
00:26:04,283 --> 00:26:06,352
Mind your own business. Forget it.

402
00:26:07,182 --> 00:26:09,323
- This is my life. - Sit down.

403
00:26:10,422 --> 00:26:12,263
You must not understand what's going on.

404
00:26:12,563 --> 00:26:14,993
Do you think you're a doctor just because you're wearing this?

405
00:26:14,993 --> 00:26:16,063
That's not true.

406
00:26:16,692 --> 00:26:18,963
Just get treated while we're offering to help.

407
00:26:40,652 --> 00:26:42,452
Something must be bothering you...

408
00:26:43,553 --> 00:26:45,162
seeing that you're at the chapel at this hour.

409
00:26:47,622 --> 00:26:48,692
Where did I see her?

410
00:26:49,632 --> 00:26:51,092
She looks so familiar.

411
00:26:53,033 --> 00:26:55,473
I'm Kang Noo Ri, a resident in Psychiatry.

412
00:26:55,632 --> 00:26:57,303
What do you need to talk to me about?

413
00:26:57,402 --> 00:27:00,342
Do you know Doc SC?

414
00:27:01,743 --> 00:27:05,543
All the hospitals are in a panic because of that site.

415
00:27:06,182 --> 00:27:07,842
They're planning to fire...

416
00:27:07,842 --> 00:27:09,952
all the doctors that signed up as a member on that site.

417
00:27:11,083 --> 00:27:16,553
But our hospital decided to treat those who have voyeurism.

418
00:27:19,223 --> 00:27:20,523
In other words,

419
00:27:21,192 --> 00:27:23,763
you're my patient now.

420
00:27:25,432 --> 00:27:28,162
I remember now. It's her.

421
00:27:28,503 --> 00:27:30,432
Everything will be kept confidential.

422
00:27:32,473 --> 00:27:34,342
You must be shocked.

423
00:27:36,313 --> 00:27:39,213
Don't worry. You have a doctor now.

424
00:27:40,942 --> 00:27:42,852
We finished talking to them individually.

425
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:44,912
Five people agreed to receive treatment.

426
00:27:45,152 --> 00:27:47,223
I want you to take charge of what's going on.

427
00:27:47,422 --> 00:27:49,223
It's a great chance to win the director's favor.

428
00:27:50,253 --> 00:27:52,293
What happened to your friend, sir?

429
00:27:53,293 --> 00:27:54,823
His life is over.

430
00:27:55,263 --> 00:27:58,362
He always complained of stress.

431
00:27:59,102 --> 00:28:01,233
So many people badmouthed him for performing heart surgery...

432
00:28:01,233 --> 00:28:02,372
on the former president.

433
00:28:03,333 --> 00:28:04,702
What a waste of great talent.

434
00:28:05,003 --> 00:28:06,642
He won't ever get to do surgery again.

435
00:28:07,743 --> 00:28:09,372
I can't believe he has voyeurism.

436
00:28:11,142 --> 00:28:12,942
- Goodbye. - Bye.

437
00:28:13,682 --> 00:28:14,713
My goodness.

438
00:28:15,682 --> 00:28:18,053
I'm so happy today. I can't go without giving you this.

439
00:28:18,053 --> 00:28:19,352
Here's your tip.

440
00:28:20,053 --> 00:28:21,892
Go on and take it.

441
00:28:21,892 --> 00:28:24,493
- Thank you. - See you again.

442
00:28:24,493 --> 00:28:26,362
- I hope you come again. - See you.

443
00:28:34,202 --> 00:28:35,202
Ji Sun!

444
00:28:36,333 --> 00:28:37,402
He gave me a tip.

445
00:28:42,372 --> 00:28:43,442
You can have it.

446
00:28:48,412 --> 00:28:49,553
What's the matter?

447
00:28:50,053 --> 00:28:52,422
- What's wrong? - This isn't a bar.

448
00:28:53,352 --> 00:28:55,152
Why did you sit with them and pour drinks for them?

449
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:56,723
This is a restaurant.

450
00:28:57,023 --> 00:28:58,622
I opened this restaurant...

451
00:28:58,622 --> 00:29:00,323
so I could serve a nice meal...

452
00:29:00,323 --> 00:29:01,823
to those who are too busy to cook for themselves.

453
00:29:02,463 --> 00:29:04,463
What could I do? He asked me to do it.

454
00:29:05,533 --> 00:29:07,303
He asked me to pour alcohol for him.

455
00:29:07,503 --> 00:29:09,303
You hate doing that kind of stuff. Just be yourself.

456
00:29:13,243 --> 00:29:14,473
Are you saying...

457
00:29:15,102 --> 00:29:17,043
I should've yelled at him and thrown a fit?

458
00:29:18,142 --> 00:29:19,283
That would've been better.

459
00:29:20,182 --> 00:29:22,053
I didn't want to pour alcohol for him.

460
00:29:23,412 --> 00:29:25,483
But I tried not to get angry for your sake.

461
00:29:25,983 --> 00:29:27,053
You did it for me?

462
00:29:27,952 --> 00:29:29,793
Why would you do something like that for me?

463
00:29:30,192 --> 00:29:32,622
When did I ever tell you to stoop low for our customers?

464
00:29:33,223 --> 00:29:34,323
Do you have no pride?

465
00:29:34,763 --> 00:29:37,263
You should just go back to getting angry like before.

466
00:29:37,892 --> 00:29:39,662
It's so frustrating to see you like this.

467
00:29:42,672 --> 00:29:43,733
You're right.

468
00:29:44,303 --> 00:29:45,902
I have no pride.

469
00:29:46,702 --> 00:29:48,003
I even got fired from the hospital,

470
00:29:48,003 --> 00:29:49,172
so why would I care about that?

471
00:29:49,912 --> 00:29:51,513
Nothing about me is normal,

472
00:29:51,513 --> 00:29:53,283
so why would I care about my pride?

473
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:56,612
What's so wrong with pleasing a customer?

474
00:29:57,083 --> 00:29:58,412
What matters is how much you sell.

475
00:29:58,882 --> 00:30:00,083
You idiot.

476
00:30:00,852 --> 00:30:01,852
Yes, I'm an idiot.

477
00:30:02,652 --> 00:30:04,952
You're all I have left, so I can do anything for you!

478
00:30:09,662 --> 00:30:10,733
Woo Joo.

479
00:30:25,342 --> 00:30:27,612
- I won! - He wins!

480
00:30:29,983 --> 00:30:32,083
Great job.

481
00:30:34,523 --> 00:30:35,523
Hello?

482
00:30:39,682 --> 00:30:41,152
(Episode 12)

483
00:30:43,166 --> 00:30:44,406
Dr. Lee.

484
00:30:45,035 --> 00:30:47,076
I liked Woo Joo from the day we met.

485
00:30:47,935 --> 00:30:50,276
She was honest, feisty,

486
00:30:50,406 --> 00:30:53,476
never played coy, or ignored an injustice.

487
00:30:54,246 --> 00:30:55,915
She put up with disadvantages even less.

488
00:30:56,915 --> 00:31:00,415
But these days, she suddenly turned into a fool.

489
00:31:01,756 --> 00:31:03,555
She bottles up her emotions.

490
00:31:04,186 --> 00:31:07,025
She became timid and has no pride.

491
00:31:08,555 --> 00:31:10,525
She never gets angry about things she should be angry about.

492
00:31:10,995 --> 00:31:14,436
I'm worried now that the fiery girl never gets angry anymore.

493
00:31:16,366 --> 00:31:19,805
One should live as you are. You can't try to change.

494
00:31:20,036 --> 00:31:21,305
That will make you sick.

495
00:31:25,546 --> 00:31:28,076
She didn't really want to quit stage therapy.

496
00:31:28,245 --> 00:31:30,186
Doing that made her so happy.

497
00:31:33,146 --> 00:31:36,625
Can't you just take her back as if you can't do without her?

498
00:31:42,295 --> 00:31:46,126
I made a decision a long time ago.

499
00:31:47,165 --> 00:31:49,295
But recently, I am losing my resolve...

500
00:31:51,665 --> 00:31:52,866
because of Woo Joo.

501
00:31:54,206 --> 00:31:58,245
I'm looking for a reason to persuade myself these days.

502
00:32:04,545 --> 00:32:06,855
- Woo Joo. - Doctor.

503
00:32:08,456 --> 00:32:11,086
What are you doing out here? Why didn't you come in?

504
00:32:11,855 --> 00:32:14,825
I walked without knowing where I was going,

505
00:32:15,995 --> 00:32:17,766
and ended up here.

506
00:32:18,165 --> 00:32:19,266
Is something wrong?

507
00:32:19,266 --> 00:32:21,695
I don't have a single friend now.

508
00:32:22,965 --> 00:32:24,206
Thinking that...

509
00:32:24,805 --> 00:32:27,176
no one in this world is on my side,

510
00:32:29,435 --> 00:32:30,745
makes me feel so sad.

511
00:32:31,506 --> 00:32:32,706
I suddenly felt...

512
00:32:34,146 --> 00:32:35,945
so frustrated.

513
00:32:37,016 --> 00:32:38,415
So I walked aimlessly.

514
00:32:38,786 --> 00:32:41,086
You came to me, so I'll be your friend.

515
00:32:41,986 --> 00:32:43,116
You will?

516
00:32:44,255 --> 00:32:45,886
What shall two friends do now?

517
00:32:47,025 --> 00:32:48,055
Let's go to the sea.

518
00:32:49,055 --> 00:32:50,465
Let's go to the seaside.

519
00:33:02,106 --> 00:33:03,475
You said the seaside.

520
00:33:05,975 --> 00:33:06,975
Doctor.

521
00:33:07,715 --> 00:33:09,046
Why do you think...

522
00:33:09,875 --> 00:33:12,185
my emotions are so extreme?

523
00:33:13,655 --> 00:33:15,916
I feel like I'll suffer and then die,

524
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:19,426
but then I feel fine as if nothing was wrong.

525
00:33:20,055 --> 00:33:21,926
Then right away, I hit rock bottom again.

526
00:33:23,725 --> 00:33:24,826
Look at me now.

527
00:33:25,666 --> 00:33:27,266
I wanted to see the sea,

528
00:33:28,866 --> 00:33:32,435
and I got distracted by those blinking lights...

529
00:33:32,435 --> 00:33:34,336
and made you turn around.

530
00:33:35,535 --> 00:33:36,875
What's the matter with that?

531
00:33:37,245 --> 00:33:38,845
Live as your heart leads you.

532
00:33:39,405 --> 00:33:40,516
It's fine.

533
00:33:42,446 --> 00:33:44,285
Am I really okay?

534
00:33:46,546 --> 00:33:50,025
I'll prescribe you something to do away with your gloom.

535
00:33:51,426 --> 00:33:53,956
Go to him and tell him that...

536
00:33:54,025 --> 00:33:55,956
you'll continue with stage therapy.

537
00:33:56,866 --> 00:33:59,995
That last time, you said what you didn't mean out of anger.

538
00:34:00,766 --> 00:34:02,796
That you really need to do it.

539
00:34:04,035 --> 00:34:07,505
That you must do it in order to be treated.

540
00:34:24,856 --> 00:34:27,255
You treat sick people probably because...

541
00:34:28,755 --> 00:34:30,896
you hurt even more inside.

542
00:35:07,766 --> 00:35:08,795
Song, who was on the run...

543
00:35:08,795 --> 00:35:10,965
for running a site known as "Doc SC"...

544
00:35:11,235 --> 00:35:14,235
was arrested today by the Seoul Cyber Investigation Team.

545
00:35:14,636 --> 00:35:16,306
Song, who is a plastic surgeon,

546
00:35:16,306 --> 00:35:19,376
created an internet cafe called "Doc SC"...

547
00:35:19,376 --> 00:35:21,115
which only doctors could become members of.

548
00:35:21,316 --> 00:35:23,646
He's being charged with uploading secretly taken pictures of women...

549
00:35:23,646 --> 00:35:25,545
and spreading them online.

550
00:35:25,646 --> 00:35:27,655
I'm really glad the administrator of that site...

551
00:35:27,655 --> 00:35:29,016
wasn't someone from our hospital.

552
00:35:29,186 --> 00:35:32,186
Whether it's the administrator or a member, they're all the same.

553
00:35:32,756 --> 00:35:33,996
Since the administrator's been caught,

554
00:35:33,996 --> 00:35:35,996
I guess all the members will be revealed, right?

555
00:35:36,355 --> 00:35:37,525
Of course.

556
00:35:38,696 --> 00:35:41,496
I'm just worried our hospital's name will be disclosed too.

557
00:35:42,735 --> 00:35:44,706
It seems like all the doctors from our hospital...

558
00:35:44,706 --> 00:35:46,365
watched it out of simple curiosity.

559
00:35:47,175 --> 00:35:48,235
You know the saying,

560
00:35:48,235 --> 00:35:49,706
"He who will steal an egg will steal an ox."

561
00:35:50,105 --> 00:35:52,545
That's why we're taking measures to solve this first.

562
00:35:55,246 --> 00:35:58,045
From now on, raise your O, X pickets...

563
00:35:58,045 --> 00:35:59,915
to the questions I ask.

564
00:36:00,915 --> 00:36:04,285
Have you visited a particular place or an internet site...

565
00:36:04,285 --> 00:36:06,386
to see pornography?

566
00:36:13,795 --> 00:36:15,595
Even during business hours,

567
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:19,865
did you visit an illegal site to see pornography?

568
00:36:24,775 --> 00:36:29,045
Were you addicted to pornography before you became 18?

569
00:36:32,615 --> 00:36:34,915
Did you ever forget work or miss something important...

570
00:36:35,016 --> 00:36:37,855
because you had to watch that type of pornography,

571
00:36:38,186 --> 00:36:41,095
and did that eventually affect your everyday life?

572
00:37:04,186 --> 00:37:05,985
Do you feel anxious and humiliated right now?

573
00:37:07,686 --> 00:37:09,355
Are you sweating, finding it hard to breathe,

574
00:37:09,355 --> 00:37:10,355
and feeling frustrated?

575
00:37:11,785 --> 00:37:15,355
If your impulse for voyeurism gets stronger, you can't control it.

576
00:37:15,795 --> 00:37:18,025
You keep searching for stimulating content.

577
00:37:18,425 --> 00:37:20,896
And in the end, it doesn't just end with secretly peeking.

578
00:37:22,936 --> 00:37:25,436
It leads to exhibitionism where you show your private parts...

579
00:37:25,735 --> 00:37:27,206
to other people.

580
00:37:27,735 --> 00:37:30,136
Are you saying I'm a pervert?

581
00:37:30,975 --> 00:37:33,775
Just now, when you heard the word "pornography",

582
00:37:34,175 --> 00:37:38,016
everything you watched until now flashed in your head, right?

583
00:37:38,016 --> 00:37:40,186
Stop treating me like some lowly scum.

584
00:37:49,025 --> 00:37:50,696
His condition is worse than I thought.

585
00:37:53,566 --> 00:37:54,636
Are you nervous?

586
00:37:56,795 --> 00:37:58,665
You're not looking at me straight.

587
00:37:59,806 --> 00:38:01,806
Is it because I'm a woman?

588
00:38:04,345 --> 00:38:07,016
I'm not a woman, but a psychiatrist.

589
00:38:07,715 --> 00:38:08,775
It's not that...

590
00:38:18,655 --> 00:38:20,126
I can't do this anymore.

591
00:38:20,795 --> 00:38:21,795
I'm really sorry.

592
00:38:27,396 --> 00:38:28,696
What's wrong with him?

593
00:38:33,235 --> 00:38:35,636
Did you check yourself?

594
00:38:35,735 --> 00:38:38,675
The site has been closed down, so I couldn't check myself.

595
00:38:38,876 --> 00:38:41,345
But the people who saw it captured the picture and shared it.

596
00:38:41,746 --> 00:38:43,175
One of my friends even saw it.

597
00:38:46,715 --> 00:38:48,915
And Noo Ri doesn't know at all?

598
00:38:49,016 --> 00:38:50,256
She probably has no idea.

599
00:38:50,826 --> 00:38:52,126
She'd throw a fit if she found out.

600
00:38:54,425 --> 00:38:56,725
Those perverted jerks. Goodness.

601
00:38:58,196 --> 00:39:00,196
Noo Ri doesn't even know that, and she's counseling.

602
00:39:17,985 --> 00:39:19,586
What are you studying so hard?

603
00:39:21,586 --> 00:39:22,816
He's my first patient.

604
00:39:23,885 --> 00:39:27,225
I talked to him and discovered a lot of other problems too.

605
00:39:29,225 --> 00:39:31,066
I really want to treat him.

606
00:39:33,765 --> 00:39:36,635
But he's so timid.

607
00:39:37,635 --> 00:39:39,235
He can't even look me in the eye.

608
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:41,605
I did some research,

609
00:39:41,975 --> 00:39:44,145
and people who are timid,

610
00:39:44,645 --> 00:39:47,776
have watched a shocking type of pornography when they were young,

611
00:39:47,845 --> 00:39:50,885
or received the wrong type of sexual education...

612
00:39:50,885 --> 00:39:52,715
have a high possibility of having voyeurism.

613
00:39:59,255 --> 00:40:00,255
Noo Ri.

614
00:40:01,895 --> 00:40:03,965
Why don't we change your first patient?

615
00:40:04,296 --> 00:40:07,135
- What? - Leave that patient to me.

616
00:40:07,666 --> 00:40:09,965
I think you shouldn't be a part of this paraphilia treatment case.

617
00:40:11,265 --> 00:40:14,206
But why? Did I make a mistake?

618
00:40:14,206 --> 00:40:16,806
- No, it's not that... - Then what's wrong?

619
00:40:19,145 --> 00:40:22,645
It's because you are a victim.

620
00:40:27,255 --> 00:40:28,556
What do you mean?

621
00:40:36,755 --> 00:40:39,365
Let's begin the strategic seminar...

622
00:40:39,365 --> 00:40:42,436
about drug treatment of osteoporotic fracture patients...

623
00:40:42,666 --> 00:40:45,765
and prevention of falling accidents.

624
00:40:52,206 --> 00:40:53,245
Who are you?

625
00:40:54,245 --> 00:40:55,276
It's you, isn't it?

626
00:40:55,645 --> 00:40:57,985
You posted my picture on Doc SC, didn't you?

627
00:40:57,985 --> 00:40:59,115
No, I'm not.

628
00:41:00,245 --> 00:41:02,686
- No. - Don't lie to me.

629
00:41:02,855 --> 00:41:05,355
That's why you can't even look at me straight.

630
00:41:07,225 --> 00:41:09,196
Hey. Did you like secretly looking at me?

631
00:41:11,066 --> 00:41:13,196
Do you want to see more? Shall I show you?

632
00:41:13,995 --> 00:41:14,995
My gosh.

633
00:41:19,465 --> 00:41:21,676
All the professors and teachers in here,

634
00:41:22,406 --> 00:41:24,605
this jerk secretly took my picture...

635
00:41:24,605 --> 00:41:27,215
and uploaded it on the infamous Doc SC site.

636
00:41:28,176 --> 00:41:31,686
I didn't even know that and studied all night in the library...

637
00:41:32,316 --> 00:41:34,485
in order to fix his voyeurism.

638
00:41:36,355 --> 00:41:38,326
Can you believe how messed up this is?

639
00:41:38,556 --> 00:41:40,725
- What are you doing? - What?

640
00:41:41,056 --> 00:41:43,326
He needs to suffer exactly like me.

641
00:41:43,926 --> 00:41:45,196
He needs to feel what it's like...

642
00:41:45,196 --> 00:41:47,095
to be stripped naked in front of the world!

643
00:41:47,095 --> 00:41:48,135
It's not me!

644
00:41:49,936 --> 00:41:52,765
I didn't upload it. All I did was watch!

645
00:41:59,906 --> 00:42:00,975
I'm sorry.

646
00:42:02,975 --> 00:42:05,645
Was it a mistake to entrust Noo Ri with a patient?

647
00:42:05,745 --> 00:42:08,015
I'm afraid so.

648
00:42:08,186 --> 00:42:11,556
From Noo Ri's point of view, it's understandable.

649
00:42:12,456 --> 00:42:13,755
What are you talking about?

650
00:42:14,026 --> 00:42:16,026
How could a doctor reveal her patient's information...

651
00:42:16,026 --> 00:42:18,225
in front of all those people?

652
00:42:19,026 --> 00:42:21,696
She had to differentiate from being a doctor and a victim.

653
00:42:22,436 --> 00:42:23,796
Okay, I heard you.

654
00:42:24,666 --> 00:42:27,706
But about those pictures. Are you sure he took them?

655
00:42:28,475 --> 00:42:32,076
We've reported it to the police, so we'll find out soon.

656
00:42:33,576 --> 00:42:35,276
Take Noo Ri out of this...

657
00:42:35,645 --> 00:42:37,946
and Dr. In, you can treat her patient.

658
00:42:38,145 --> 00:42:39,845
- Okay. - Sir.

659
00:42:40,556 --> 00:42:42,255
I know we're focusing on treating the inflictor,

660
00:42:42,255 --> 00:42:44,056
but shouldn't we treat the victim first?

661
00:42:44,686 --> 00:42:46,885
Well, I've thought of that too.

662
00:42:47,826 --> 00:42:50,526
But the victims of these types of cases usually don't step forward.

663
00:42:51,666 --> 00:42:53,465
I'll discuss this with the director...

664
00:42:54,196 --> 00:42:55,666
and find out what we can do.

665
00:42:59,605 --> 00:43:01,076
That resident from the Emergency Medicine Center...

666
00:43:01,076 --> 00:43:02,475
seemed like he was in critical condition.

667
00:43:02,975 --> 00:43:05,875
If this gets worse, he might even quit his job this moment.

668
00:43:06,206 --> 00:43:08,375
So stop agonizing over it and call Han Woo Joo.

669
00:43:12,015 --> 00:43:14,686
You need her for the patients' sake.

670
00:43:17,586 --> 00:43:19,326
Do you have feelings for her or something?

671
00:43:21,196 --> 00:43:23,855
- What are you talking about? - You're hesitating so much.

672
00:43:24,965 --> 00:43:27,336
What are you so afraid of?

673
00:43:27,796 --> 00:43:30,536
This isn't for Ms. Han, but for the patients.

674
00:43:32,005 --> 00:43:33,666
Noo Ri needs to be treated too now.

675
00:43:34,806 --> 00:43:36,576
We can't have another victim like her.

676
00:43:38,576 --> 00:43:39,645
Think about it carefully.

677
00:44:38,306 --> 00:44:39,365
We meet often.

678
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:46,306
I heard what happened to the Orthopedics resident.

679
00:44:46,745 --> 00:44:48,676
Is that how you psychiatrists treat patients?

680
00:44:49,015 --> 00:44:50,515
By humiliating them in public?

681
00:44:52,286 --> 00:44:54,885
You said you kept everything secret.

682
00:44:55,215 --> 00:44:57,426
You just got someone all worked up.

683
00:45:01,395 --> 00:45:02,696
"Worked up"?

684
00:45:04,566 --> 00:45:06,696
Is this how you respond to goodwill?

685
00:45:07,735 --> 00:45:09,895
You could lose your medical license,

686
00:45:11,005 --> 00:45:12,635
and we're offering to treat you.

687
00:45:13,206 --> 00:45:14,436
Don't you feel anything?

688
00:45:19,206 --> 00:45:21,745
Did you not just look at photos and videos?

689
00:45:22,615 --> 00:45:23,975
Did you take and upload photos too?

690
00:45:29,286 --> 00:45:30,355
You did.

691
00:45:37,696 --> 00:45:39,395
Did you think about the victims?

692
00:45:40,395 --> 00:45:41,536
Do you think...

693
00:45:42,095 --> 00:45:44,965
we offered to treat trash like you because we adore you?

694
00:45:45,206 --> 00:45:46,235
We didn't.

695
00:45:47,206 --> 00:45:49,875
It's because you'll just crave something worse and worse,

696
00:45:49,875 --> 00:45:51,845
and end up creating even worse trash.

697
00:45:52,406 --> 00:45:55,276
And that will create even more victims.

698
00:45:55,475 --> 00:45:56,875
That's why we're treating you.

699
00:45:56,875 --> 00:45:59,316
Not to save you but the future victims out there.

700
00:46:01,255 --> 00:46:03,615
Do you think you're different from the perverts...

701
00:46:03,615 --> 00:46:05,656
on the street because you wear a doctor's gown?

702
00:46:05,985 --> 00:46:07,696
You're all the same.

703
00:46:07,826 --> 00:46:10,725
Your symptoms are different, but it's all the same paraphilia.

704
00:46:15,865 --> 00:46:17,036
I'm done being generous.

705
00:46:17,196 --> 00:46:19,306
Accept our help and get treated,

706
00:46:19,505 --> 00:46:22,906
or go on peeking at photos and end up being humiliated in the open.

707
00:46:23,206 --> 00:46:24,206
It's your choice.

708
00:46:26,206 --> 00:46:27,276
I'll...

709
00:46:49,265 --> 00:46:51,005
- What? - What?

710
00:46:53,666 --> 00:46:55,005
Don't you have something to say?

711
00:46:56,105 --> 00:46:57,135
I don't.

712
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:03,345
- I'm off to see Lee Si Joon. - Did you call ahead?

713
00:47:05,186 --> 00:47:06,416
I'll just barge in.

714
00:47:07,086 --> 00:47:09,985
If I ask and he says no, I'll lie down and protest.

715
00:47:11,885 --> 00:47:12,956
My gosh.

716
00:47:13,485 --> 00:47:15,026
You're finally back.

717
00:47:16,125 --> 00:47:17,725
You're such a nuisance.

718
00:47:31,475 --> 00:47:34,145
I'd like you to come back to work at the hospital.

719
00:47:34,515 --> 00:47:36,416
- What? - The Social Welfare Team...

720
00:47:36,916 --> 00:47:39,516
tried very hard to find your replacement,

721
00:47:40,185 --> 00:47:43,316
but they're protesting that they can't find someone with your talent.

722
00:47:43,786 --> 00:47:46,826
I said it would be hard to ask you to come back,

723
00:47:47,996 --> 00:47:50,796
but everyone insists they can't do without you.

724
00:47:51,266 --> 00:47:53,895
They forced me to talk to you, so here I am.

725
00:47:55,595 --> 00:47:56,595
Help me out.

726
00:47:57,195 --> 00:47:58,806
Oh, I see.

727
00:48:01,836 --> 00:48:05,205
Well, you asked so nicely and earnestly,

728
00:48:05,205 --> 00:48:07,976
and it's hard to say no to you.

729
00:48:12,115 --> 00:48:13,185
Please help me out.

730
00:48:19,286 --> 00:48:20,996
I have a condition.

731
00:48:26,365 --> 00:48:27,566
You want me to...

732
00:48:28,865 --> 00:48:32,506
sing to these flowers?

733
00:48:34,276 --> 00:48:36,236
I sang to them every day,

734
00:48:37,605 --> 00:48:40,145
but I thought they'd grow even better...

735
00:48:40,145 --> 00:48:42,216
if they heard a man's voice too.

736
00:48:46,185 --> 00:48:49,286
Why should I sing to them?

737
00:48:50,385 --> 00:48:52,326
- To flowers? - Just do it.

738
00:48:54,895 --> 00:48:57,566
But... I can't sing.

739
00:48:57,566 --> 00:49:00,066
Do you think flowers care about that?

740
00:49:01,296 --> 00:49:02,496
Go on.

741
00:49:13,276 --> 00:49:16,115
1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4.

742
00:49:16,115 --> 00:49:17,115
Mom...

743
00:49:18,016 --> 00:49:19,316
Mom.

744
00:49:20,246 --> 00:49:25,385
Mom, don't you worry

745
00:49:25,385 --> 00:49:28,256
Mom, your son is doing fine

746
00:49:28,455 --> 00:49:31,695
If the repetitive days bring you down

747
00:49:31,695 --> 00:49:34,836
Just let it out, yes

748
00:49:37,165 --> 00:49:39,506
Let out a long sigh

749
00:49:39,506 --> 00:49:41,905
Do it, yes

750
00:49:43,476 --> 00:49:45,675
Count from 1 to 10

751
00:49:45,675 --> 00:49:48,476
Do it

752
00:49:49,375 --> 00:49:51,816
When the long day is over

753
00:49:51,816 --> 00:49:54,046
Do it, yes

754
00:49:56,716 --> 00:50:01,955
Why can't I forget you?

755
00:50:16,105 --> 00:50:17,105
How embarrassing.

756
00:50:18,405 --> 00:50:19,605
Why did you make me do that?

757
00:50:19,605 --> 00:50:21,445
- That was amazing. - Goodness.

758
00:50:21,516 --> 00:50:23,046
That was embarrassing.

759
00:50:24,516 --> 00:50:25,516
My gosh.

760
00:50:40,395 --> 00:50:43,095
(Treatment to overcome voyeuristic disorder)

761
00:51:02,786 --> 00:51:06,385
I'll have to play many roles this time.

762
00:51:07,026 --> 00:51:09,056
I understand why you wanted me.

763
00:51:11,266 --> 00:51:13,125
That's why I begged of you.

764
00:51:13,566 --> 00:51:14,966
Because we needed you.

765
00:51:18,205 --> 00:51:19,466
If I must confess,

766
00:51:20,306 --> 00:51:22,635
I was going to visit you first.

767
00:51:36,385 --> 00:51:38,885
(Eun Kang Medical Center)

768
00:51:39,826 --> 00:51:41,296
So, Mr. Shin Jong Sik.

769
00:51:42,095 --> 00:51:43,355
This session...

770
00:51:43,625 --> 00:51:47,165
was arranged to hear your inner thoughts.

771
00:51:47,695 --> 00:51:49,165
It will be unfamiliar,

772
00:51:49,365 --> 00:51:52,865
but pretend this situation is real and keep up.

773
00:51:53,466 --> 00:51:54,536
Okay.

774
00:52:00,006 --> 00:52:01,875
She is a police officer.

775
00:52:10,185 --> 00:52:12,056
You call yourself a doctor,

776
00:52:12,286 --> 00:52:15,695
and take photos of women without them knowing,

777
00:52:15,695 --> 00:52:19,125
and share it with friends. How can you even do that?

778
00:52:23,466 --> 00:52:24,635
You.

779
00:52:26,766 --> 00:52:30,036
When you saw the photos of the numerous women on the site,

780
00:52:30,375 --> 00:52:34,776
did you think that they belonged to you?

781
00:52:35,316 --> 00:52:37,675
Did you think that you ruled over them?

782
00:52:43,986 --> 00:52:47,125
In real life, you can never say a word to a woman's face,

783
00:52:47,685 --> 00:52:50,496
but you log onto such pornographic sites...

784
00:52:51,796 --> 00:52:53,066
to feel superior, right?

785
00:52:56,195 --> 00:52:58,466
Mr. Shin, don't you have anything to say?

786
00:52:59,205 --> 00:53:00,365
Say it out loud.

787
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:05,375
It's not that.

788
00:53:05,375 --> 00:53:09,316
Did you feel as if you dominated those women?

789
00:53:10,216 --> 00:53:11,546
You ball of inferiority.

790
00:53:11,546 --> 00:53:12,816
I said it's not that.

791
00:53:12,816 --> 00:53:14,516
Then what was it?

792
00:53:14,986 --> 00:53:18,526
Did your first-ever date humiliate you in some way?

793
00:53:18,526 --> 00:53:19,885
It isn't like that.

794
00:53:20,086 --> 00:53:22,455
No woman in your life...

795
00:53:22,895 --> 00:53:24,895
ever acknowledged you, right?

796
00:53:24,895 --> 00:53:27,496
No. It's not that!

797
00:53:42,216 --> 00:53:44,945
As of this moment, Mr. Shin...

798
00:53:45,716 --> 00:53:48,185
is a teenage boy of 15.

799
00:53:49,455 --> 00:53:52,885
You got back from school and your mother is very angry.

800
00:53:54,125 --> 00:53:55,155
Why is that?

801
00:54:03,135 --> 00:54:04,195
What is this?

802
00:54:06,336 --> 00:54:07,836
Why was this in your room?

803
00:54:08,336 --> 00:54:10,236
You're reading this at your age?

804
00:54:11,276 --> 00:54:13,345
You're so pathetic!

805
00:54:14,675 --> 00:54:17,375
What did you think when you read this?

806
00:54:17,746 --> 00:54:19,746
What evil things did you think about?

807
00:54:20,345 --> 00:54:21,685
It's not like that. I just...

808
00:54:21,685 --> 00:54:23,756
I asked what you did!

809
00:54:24,185 --> 00:54:25,955
Shin Jong Sik. You have something to say.

810
00:54:26,286 --> 00:54:27,355
Speak up.

811
00:54:27,556 --> 00:54:29,455
I was just curious.

812
00:54:29,796 --> 00:54:30,996
I didn't do anything bad.

813
00:54:30,996 --> 00:54:34,796
If you have the time for this, memorize more English vocabulary!

814
00:54:35,036 --> 00:54:37,236
Jong Sik, please.

815
00:54:37,905 --> 00:54:40,236
We're barely getting by.

816
00:54:40,566 --> 00:54:42,905
You're the hope of the whole family.

817
00:54:43,036 --> 00:54:46,345
Mom and Dad are working so hard to support you.

818
00:54:47,645 --> 00:54:49,776
Do you have the time to read such things?

819
00:54:50,576 --> 00:54:51,786
I'm sorry.

820
00:54:51,986 --> 00:54:55,685
A beating from your dad will teach you a lesson.

821
00:54:56,556 --> 00:54:58,125
No, I'm sorry.

822
00:54:59,226 --> 00:55:01,026
- I won't do it again. I... - Let go!

823
00:55:16,375 --> 00:55:17,405
Now...

824
00:55:18,345 --> 00:55:20,076
your younger sister is here.

825
00:55:23,615 --> 00:55:24,685
Jong Sik.

826
00:55:28,615 --> 00:55:30,455
In the subway...

827
00:55:32,256 --> 00:55:34,256
someone took a photo of me.

828
00:55:34,996 --> 00:55:36,655
Some scumbag...

829
00:55:36,955 --> 00:55:40,326
put my photo on a site called "Doc SC".

830
00:55:41,466 --> 00:55:43,095
Those jerks will be...

831
00:55:43,336 --> 00:55:47,766
looking at it right now and getting all sorts of ideas!

832
00:55:48,405 --> 00:55:50,935
Those animals are crushing me.

833
00:55:52,576 --> 00:55:54,246
You're a doctor too.

834
00:55:54,845 --> 00:55:57,776
How can doctors do something like that?

835
00:55:57,776 --> 00:56:00,986
Is the world allowed to be such a crazy place?

836
00:56:05,185 --> 00:56:06,226
I'm sorry.

837
00:56:08,155 --> 00:56:09,326
It's all my fault.

838
00:56:10,256 --> 00:56:11,326
I'm sorry.

839
00:56:15,736 --> 00:56:16,736
What are you sorry for?

840
00:56:25,006 --> 00:56:26,046
I am...

841
00:56:27,806 --> 00:56:28,875
trash.

842
00:56:32,516 --> 00:56:34,516
I knew what I was doing was wrong,

843
00:56:37,955 --> 00:56:39,726
but I couldn't stop.

844
00:56:40,955 --> 00:56:42,195
Whenever I got stressed...

845
00:56:43,526 --> 00:56:44,996
or was feeling tortured,

846
00:56:46,266 --> 00:56:48,165
- I unwillingly... - You didn't just look.

847
00:56:49,236 --> 00:56:50,895
You took and uploaded photos too, right?

848
00:56:54,006 --> 00:56:55,336
Do you feel guilty?

849
00:56:55,976 --> 00:56:56,976
Over what?

850
00:57:01,076 --> 00:57:02,145
I did it.

851
00:57:05,746 --> 00:57:06,816
That photo.

852
00:57:09,556 --> 00:57:11,526
The photo of one of our doctors.

853
00:57:15,625 --> 00:57:16,895
I took it.

854
00:57:23,595 --> 00:57:25,435
I didn't know you worked here.

855
00:57:27,435 --> 00:57:28,776
I'm truly sorry.

856
00:57:30,905 --> 00:57:32,576
I'm truly sorry.

857
00:57:35,645 --> 00:57:36,675
Mr. Shin.

858
00:57:36,945 --> 00:57:39,486
I get that you were traumatized.

859
00:57:40,145 --> 00:57:44,316
But that doesn't mean you can be forgiven for what you did.

860
00:57:45,256 --> 00:57:46,586
Paraphilia...

861
00:57:47,125 --> 00:57:50,425
is a terrible illness that harms other people.

862
00:57:51,395 --> 00:57:52,966
We will treat you,

863
00:57:53,296 --> 00:57:56,766
but for the crimes that you committed,

864
00:57:58,365 --> 00:57:59,705
please take responsibility.

865
00:58:00,905 --> 00:58:03,736
I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.

866
00:58:18,086 --> 00:58:19,086
You know,

867
00:58:20,625 --> 00:58:22,955
I like this place a lot.

868
00:58:25,296 --> 00:58:27,266
Thank you for letting me...

869
00:58:28,566 --> 00:58:29,635
come back to work.

870
00:58:31,466 --> 00:58:32,836
When I was six,

871
00:58:35,276 --> 00:58:37,605
I went to the seaside with my mom.

872
00:58:39,476 --> 00:58:42,845
I was catching clams and crabs...

873
00:58:42,845 --> 00:58:45,546
when I realized the tide was coming in.

874
00:58:47,385 --> 00:58:50,786
The water reached higher and higher and I got so scared.

875
00:58:54,655 --> 00:58:56,095
Just then, my mom...

876
00:58:59,226 --> 00:59:02,135
put me on her back and walked through the water.

877
00:59:05,466 --> 00:59:07,865
The smell from her back,

878
00:59:08,405 --> 00:59:11,076
her hair that tickled my face.

879
00:59:13,276 --> 00:59:15,976
The water that reached her thighs.

880
00:59:19,046 --> 00:59:21,286
I still remember it all so clearly.

881
00:59:24,885 --> 00:59:27,026
To me, that is happiness.

882
00:59:30,526 --> 00:59:34,226
That was the happiest moment in my whole life.

883
00:59:36,635 --> 00:59:37,796
When I come here,

884
00:59:40,165 --> 00:59:42,205
I don't feel as happy as then,

885
00:59:44,105 --> 00:59:47,076
but I feel as if I'm on my mom's back.

886
00:59:50,675 --> 00:59:51,986
I didn't ask...

887
00:59:53,645 --> 00:59:56,986
where that mother is now.

888
01:00:15,306 --> 01:00:17,836
What happens to that patient now?

889
01:00:18,976 --> 01:00:20,875
He turned himself in to the police,

890
01:00:21,205 --> 01:00:23,546
so we think he's serious about being treated.

891
01:00:24,046 --> 01:00:26,046
The problem is his addiction.

892
01:00:27,316 --> 01:00:30,016
I didn't know this was so addictive too.

893
01:00:30,586 --> 01:00:32,986
It's similar to drug or alcohol addiction.

894
01:00:33,326 --> 01:00:36,496
They crave something more potent and exhilarating,

895
01:00:36,895 --> 01:00:38,625
and it can lead to exhibitionism.

896
01:00:40,966 --> 01:00:43,466
Eventually, they ruin themselves,

897
01:00:44,296 --> 01:00:46,466
causing something unimaginable.

898
01:00:47,266 --> 01:00:49,635
Their life is ruined in one fell swoop.

899
01:00:56,615 --> 01:00:58,445
You did well today.

900
01:00:59,246 --> 01:01:01,385
You did very well yourself.

901
01:01:03,056 --> 01:01:05,056
Oh, wait. Just a moment.

902
01:01:13,865 --> 01:01:16,435
I bought this a while ago and wasn't able to give it to you.

903
01:01:17,135 --> 01:01:18,195
Here.

904
01:01:21,336 --> 01:01:22,705
Throw it away if you don't like it.

905
01:01:24,076 --> 01:01:25,175
Put it on for me.

906
01:01:45,195 --> 01:01:46,226
Go on home.

907
01:02:18,326 --> 01:02:21,165
(Fix You)

908
01:02:21,966 --> 01:02:23,336
Guess what I named this bracelet?

909
01:02:23,336 --> 01:02:24,496
"Band-aid".

910
01:02:25,165 --> 01:02:27,605
Can I be healed before the hearing?

911
01:02:27,605 --> 01:02:30,076
I heard there was an incident a month ago.

912
01:02:30,076 --> 01:02:31,776
Was it because of the panic disorder?

913
01:02:32,076 --> 01:02:34,576
You really don't know where she went?

914
01:02:34,576 --> 01:02:35,716
Her foster mother?

915
01:02:35,716 --> 01:02:37,645
She raised young Woo Joo for about six years.

916
01:02:37,746 --> 01:02:39,246
Do you think I can't find you?

917
01:02:39,246 --> 01:02:40,486
I will find you!

918
01:02:42,286 --> 01:02:44,155
Doctor, do you know how you feel?

919
01:02:45,625 --> 01:02:47,185
I don't know how I feel.

920
01:02:47,185 --> 01:02:48,226
Woo Joo!

921
01:02:48,955 --> 01:02:50,425
Han Woo Joo!
