PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

Why can't I get a refund?

CUSTOMER SATISFACTION CENTER

6
00:00:22,198 --> 00:00:24,575
I bought this two days ago!

7
00:00:25,242 --> 00:00:26,160
I'm sorry, sir.

8
00:00:26,243 --> 00:00:28,412
You lost the receipt,
so we need to check--

9
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:30,998
Do you think I'm lying?

10
00:00:31,081 --> 00:00:32,750
Do I need to get aggressive with you?

11
00:00:34,293 --> 00:00:36,629
I didn't want to do this,
but you're making me get physical.

12
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:43,010
You darn little...

13
00:00:59,151 --> 00:01:00,653
Who the fuck are you?

14
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,043
I checked with the manufacturer

15
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:18,671
and this product is only sold online.

16
00:01:18,754 --> 00:01:20,339
Sir, you can't receive a discount online

17
00:01:20,422 --> 00:01:22,716
and bring it here
for a refund at the original price.

18
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,051
You heard him.

19
00:01:25,052 --> 00:01:26,637
Do you have anything else to say?

20
00:01:27,137 --> 00:01:30,224
If you wish to get physical,
you can do so with me.

21
00:01:31,976 --> 00:01:34,353
No, it's fine.

22
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,022
Sorry about all this. I'll get going.

23
00:01:37,773 --> 00:01:39,191
Have a good day.

24
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,993
-What are you doing here?
-I can ask you the same thing.

25
00:01:49,076 --> 00:01:50,286
Is this your next target?

26
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:52,871
No, I work here.

27
00:01:52,955 --> 00:01:55,874
I'm not a fool.
You think I'd fall for that lie?

28
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:58,168
You're coming with me to Security.

29
00:02:01,797 --> 00:02:06,176
Why don't you talk to me
instead of getting physical?

30
00:02:09,388 --> 00:02:11,849
So who are you people?

31
00:02:11,932 --> 00:02:14,184
-Sorry?
-You infiltrated a five-star hotel

32
00:02:14,268 --> 00:02:16,520
and exposed its corruption to the media.

33
00:02:17,146 --> 00:02:19,189
That's not what
regular supermarket employees do.

34
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,859
Well, we're...

35
00:02:23,527 --> 00:02:24,862
You see...

36
00:02:25,738 --> 00:02:28,240
-We can't disclose--
-Just tell me already.

37
00:02:28,616 --> 00:02:31,327
It's not like
you're secret agents or Robin Hood.

38
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:32,244
Robin Hood?

39
00:02:32,745 --> 00:02:34,538
I wish.

40
00:02:34,622 --> 00:02:36,790
He can target anyone whenever he wants to.

41
00:02:37,124 --> 00:02:40,461
Meanwhile, we're dying over here
trying to meet the quota that's been set.

42
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:42,463
A quota that's been set?

43
00:02:44,298 --> 00:02:46,800
Do you work for the NIS or something?

44
00:02:46,925 --> 00:02:48,719
Something like that.

45
00:02:49,303 --> 00:02:50,721
But our operation

46
00:02:51,889 --> 00:02:54,224
-is on the larger scale.
-Larger?

47
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,436
-Such an organization exists in Korea?
-In Korea?

48
00:02:58,312 --> 00:03:02,107
You need to think bigger.

49
00:03:02,191 --> 00:03:03,734
That's right. Think big.

50
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:07,112
Ms. Weol-ju,
aren't we telling her too much?

51
00:03:08,572 --> 00:03:09,740
She's a civilian.

52
00:03:09,823 --> 00:03:12,576
She helped us score last time,

53
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:14,411
so this is the least we can do.

54
00:03:14,495 --> 00:03:17,790
Anyway. Come in, Mr. Smith.

55
00:03:30,385 --> 00:03:32,679
Agent Ju, that's ridiculous.

56
00:03:32,763 --> 00:03:35,265
You've exposed yourself
and that's not enough,

57
00:03:35,891 --> 00:03:37,017
you had to call me!

58
00:03:37,601 --> 00:03:38,936
Is this really happening?

59
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:40,938
Who is this man?

60
00:03:41,563 --> 00:03:44,525
I'm sorry, but it's better
to let her see for herself

61
00:03:44,608 --> 00:03:47,486
instead of letting her speculate
and get ideas.

62
00:03:51,406 --> 00:03:54,701
I do apologize for letting a civilian
involved in this mess.

63
00:03:54,785 --> 00:03:56,495
My name is John Smith.

64
00:03:57,496 --> 00:04:00,374
Why do you look familiar?
I know I've seen you before.

65
00:04:00,457 --> 00:04:03,419
You probably saw him on the news.

66
00:04:05,462 --> 00:04:06,630
Here.

67
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:10,259
The CIA!

68
00:04:11,927 --> 00:04:13,512
The director of the CIA?

69
00:04:15,139 --> 00:04:18,142
He's too low in the ranks
to know these things.

70
00:04:18,225 --> 00:04:20,644
EMPLOYEE LOUNGE

71
00:04:22,187 --> 00:04:24,106
Have your questions been answered?

72
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,315
Yes.

73
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:27,401
Right, so mind your own business
from now on.

74
00:04:27,484 --> 00:04:29,111
You know what'll happen.

75
00:04:29,194 --> 00:04:30,821
You don't have to tell me twice.

76
00:04:30,904 --> 00:04:33,657
My career as a bodyguard was ruined
because I caught up in your mission.

77
00:04:33,741 --> 00:04:35,117
Gosh.

78
00:04:35,951 --> 00:04:37,411
I'm truly sorry about that.

79
00:04:37,995 --> 00:04:41,039
It's why I'm asking you
to not tell the others here about me.

80
00:04:41,457 --> 00:04:42,833
Don't even acknowledge me, okay?

81
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,211
Once people find out,
I won't be able to get a job anywhere.

82
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,797
Got it. You don't need to worry. Take care.

83
00:04:51,717 --> 00:04:53,594
-Take care.
-Bye, Yeo-rin.

84
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:03,896
Hello, nice to meet you.

85
00:05:03,979 --> 00:05:05,272
I'm Kang-bae Han.

86
00:05:05,355 --> 00:05:07,149
We're good here now.

87
00:05:08,025 --> 00:05:10,819
-There's no need to be tense.
-Your Korean is amazing.

88
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,405
Do you know me though?

89
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,457
Of course I know you.
What a stupid question.

90
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:25,584
Wait. Didn't you know it was me?

91
00:05:30,798 --> 00:05:33,091
How can you be so dense?

92
00:05:33,175 --> 00:05:36,303
Your weird condition
doesn't seem to be your only problem.

93
00:05:36,804 --> 00:05:38,055
I'm worried.

94
00:05:39,306 --> 00:05:40,557
Let's get back to the groceries.

95
00:05:40,641 --> 00:05:42,643
I'll get the noodles,
you get the vegetables.

96
00:05:42,726 --> 00:05:44,519
Vegetables. Okay.

97
00:05:45,604 --> 00:05:46,897
Goodbye, Kang-bae.

98
00:05:51,026 --> 00:05:52,277
He's so fluent in English?

99
00:06:01,414 --> 00:06:04,000
MYSTIC POP-UP BAR

EPISODE 4

101
00:06:15,592 --> 00:06:16,760
Young lady!

102
00:06:20,138 --> 00:06:22,891
You can't buy
all the noodles on the shelf.

103
00:06:23,433 --> 00:06:25,936
Give me a few, will you?

104
00:06:26,645 --> 00:06:28,897
No can do. Have a good day.

105
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:33,318
Don't be like that and hand over just one.

106
00:06:33,402 --> 00:06:36,822
My grandchild wants noodles for dinner.

107
00:06:37,406 --> 00:06:39,157
I have mouths to feed as well.

108
00:06:39,741 --> 00:06:40,617
Good day.

109
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,234
Stop!

110
00:07:14,735 --> 00:07:17,738
My gosh. You shocked me!

111
00:07:19,364 --> 00:07:21,783
Were you about to steal from my cart?

112
00:07:23,118 --> 00:07:24,244
Steal?

113
00:07:24,828 --> 00:07:27,456
You haven't paid for them yet,
so they're not technically yours.

114
00:07:28,123 --> 00:07:31,335
Besides, I'm an old lady who wants
to cook noodles for her grandchild,

115
00:07:31,668 --> 00:07:33,253
but you won't even let me have one.

116
00:07:33,337 --> 00:07:36,340
You people think age
is the card that trumps everything.

117
00:07:36,924 --> 00:07:38,842
You really want to test me, lady?

118
00:07:39,343 --> 00:07:41,720
Never have I had

119
00:07:41,803 --> 00:07:45,557
such a young lady
challenging my age before.

120
00:07:46,975 --> 00:07:50,479
Fine. Let's compare ages. How old are you?

121
00:07:50,562 --> 00:07:52,606
Twenty? Twenty-one?

122
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:54,983
Seriously? You think I'm 20?

123
00:07:59,696 --> 00:08:01,782
Gosh, do I look that young?

124
00:08:01,865 --> 00:08:04,785
Yes, look at that taut skin you have

125
00:08:04,868 --> 00:08:07,454
and fine soft hair on those cheeks.

126
00:08:07,871 --> 00:08:09,289
What about your hair?

127
00:08:09,373 --> 00:08:12,209
It's jet black and all shiny.

128
00:08:12,793 --> 00:08:13,919
And these hands.

129
00:08:14,002 --> 00:08:18,548
They're both soft and smooth as if
you haven't worked a day in your life.

130
00:08:18,632 --> 00:08:20,092
See for yourself!

131
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:26,306
Look here, old lady.

132
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:28,475
-How perceptive of you.
-Of course!

133
00:08:28,976 --> 00:08:30,477
-Ma'am!
-What?

134
00:08:30,686 --> 00:08:32,896
You want noodles?

135
00:08:36,358 --> 00:08:39,111
Would this be enough?

136
00:08:43,991 --> 00:08:49,079
I apologize for having been rude to you.

137
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,291
It's all right.
Besides, you made it up by buying this.

138
00:08:54,376 --> 00:08:57,337
It seems like
your parents raised you well.

139
00:09:00,507 --> 00:09:04,011
You said you were cooking noodles.
Where are the meat and vegetables?

140
00:09:06,388 --> 00:09:08,598
My noodles don't need any of those.

141
00:09:09,599 --> 00:09:12,853
These days, people add
eggs, meat, the whole shebang,

142
00:09:13,353 --> 00:09:16,898
but that was a luxury
we couldn't afford back in the day.

143
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:20,110
We'd wash some ripened kimchi,

144
00:09:20,736 --> 00:09:22,571
finely chop it,

145
00:09:22,654 --> 00:09:24,573
season it with soy sauce and sesame oil,

146
00:09:24,656 --> 00:09:27,534
and plop it on some cooked noodles.

147
00:09:28,618 --> 00:09:32,581
Then I pour
some anchovy stock in the bowl.

148
00:09:34,124 --> 00:09:36,960
My grandson eats two bowls of it
every meal.

149
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:42,174
Ripened kimchi and sesame oil?

150
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:47,471
Anyway, for what event
do you need all these ingredients for?

151
00:09:47,929 --> 00:09:51,141
Well, there's a field day
and I'm going there to make money.

152
00:09:51,725 --> 00:09:52,851
Make money?

153
00:09:53,977 --> 00:09:56,104
You said you weren't married yet, right?

154
00:09:57,147 --> 00:09:59,274
What if I set you up with my grandson?

155
00:09:59,357 --> 00:10:02,444
He works in customer service here.
Why don't you meet him?

156
00:10:02,527 --> 00:10:04,112
Customer service?

157
00:10:04,321 --> 00:10:06,198
Yes, his name is Choi Jin-dong.

158
00:10:06,281 --> 00:10:08,700
He's sweet and works hard at his job.

159
00:10:08,784 --> 00:10:10,160
Choi Jin-dong?

160
00:10:13,663 --> 00:10:16,500
My gosh, look at the time!

161
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,503
I'm afraid I'm a little busy.
Take care, ma'am.

00:10:34,851 --> 00:10:36,103
What were you in your past life?

165
00:10:36,186 --> 00:10:38,730
-Me in my past life?
-Yes.

166
00:10:40,732 --> 00:10:43,485
Hold on. What was I again?

167
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:45,403
Why do you ask though?

168
00:10:45,987 --> 00:10:48,615
You have good handwriting,
so I was wondering if you were educated.

169
00:10:49,199 --> 00:10:51,326
What? My handwriting?

170
00:10:52,202 --> 00:10:55,413
This is bold lettering art.
I learned it at the cultural center.

171
00:10:55,497 --> 00:10:58,583
I paid 30,000 won for six classes
and extra for the materials.

172
00:10:58,667 --> 00:11:02,504
Of course. You don't exactly
strike me as a nobleman.

173
00:11:03,588 --> 00:11:04,673
Jeez.

174
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:08,260
I may not seem like it, but...

175
00:11:10,971 --> 00:11:13,056
Why do I even bother?

176
00:11:13,723 --> 00:11:15,100
Are we all set then?

177
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:18,979
Let me see.
I have the true or false questions ready.

178
00:11:19,062 --> 00:11:21,648
I didn't think you'd be this enthusiastic.

179
00:11:22,023 --> 00:11:23,066
Why wouldn't I be?

180
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:26,444
It's my chance to easily score
without having to hear sob stories.

181
00:11:26,528 --> 00:11:28,488
There's the Weol-ju I know.

182
00:11:29,072 --> 00:11:31,533
Kang-bae can have the day off then
since there's nothing to do.

183
00:11:31,616 --> 00:11:33,702
Don't be ridiculous.
These tables will be packed.

184
00:11:33,785 --> 00:11:36,204
Why should I serve customers
when I have a part-timer?

185
00:11:36,913 --> 00:11:38,373
You never give people a break.

186
00:11:38,456 --> 00:11:43,003
All right then. Squeeze these people
like you would with the noodles.

187
00:11:43,086 --> 00:11:45,380
Are you done?
We should head there and set up.

188
00:11:45,463 --> 00:11:47,716
-What about Kang-bae?
-I already have that sorted.

189
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,813
You just heard a bell ring, didn't you?

190
00:12:04,107 --> 00:12:07,819
It's okay. I'm ready to hear you out.
Go ahead and tell me.

191
00:12:09,446 --> 00:12:11,239
Go on. Go ahead.

192
00:12:11,323 --> 00:12:13,116
What bell, you pervert?

193
00:12:16,745 --> 00:12:18,163
<i>Is she worry-free</i>

194
00:12:18,747 --> 00:12:20,165
<i>or doesn't my ability work on her?</i>

195
00:12:20,999 --> 00:12:22,459
<i>What the hell could it be?</i>

196
00:12:23,084 --> 00:12:24,836
<i>I'll know if I touch her once more.</i>

197
00:12:25,962 --> 00:12:26,922
<i>If only I could--</i>

198
00:12:32,636 --> 00:12:33,511
What is this?

199
00:12:34,137 --> 00:12:35,722
Why are you following me?

200
00:12:35,805 --> 00:12:37,849
Following you? No, I wasn't--

201
00:12:37,933 --> 00:12:40,977
You have been
since we left the supermarket.

202
00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:42,479
What are you up to this time?

203
00:12:43,355 --> 00:12:44,231
That's not it.

204
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,108
I'm just going in the same direction.

205
00:12:48,026 --> 00:12:49,152
I mean it.

206
00:12:50,111 --> 00:12:51,404
I do.

207
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,282
Then go first.

208
00:13:00,247 --> 00:13:03,208
I have to ask.
Do I really not give you any feelings?

209
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:06,086
Feelings? Of course you do.

210
00:13:06,169 --> 00:13:07,337
Right? I knew it.

211
00:13:08,797 --> 00:13:12,717
Awkwardness, annoyance,
discomfort, and frustration.

212
00:13:12,801 --> 00:13:15,303
The feelings that make me
want to stay the hell away from you.

MYSTIC POP-UP BAR

214
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,361
Ms. Weol-ju!

215
00:13:32,112 --> 00:13:33,989
Ms. Weol-ju, she's immune to my touch...

216
00:13:40,328 --> 00:13:41,204
What?

217
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:44,666
The dead from Seoul.

218
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,755
The dead from South Chungcheong Province.

219
00:13:51,089 --> 00:13:51,923
What?

220
00:13:54,426 --> 00:13:57,012
The dead from South Jeolla Province.

221
00:13:57,095 --> 00:13:58,596
SOUTH JEOLLA PROVINCE

222
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,515
South Jeolla Province?

223
00:14:01,182 --> 00:14:02,434
Where am I?

224
00:14:05,645 --> 00:14:07,355

MYSTIC POP-UP BAR

226
00:14:17,949 --> 00:14:19,242
I'm at the right place.

227
00:14:24,497 --> 00:14:26,666
What the hell is going on?

228
00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:28,918
What is this?

229
00:14:29,711 --> 00:14:31,838
Kang-bae, over here!

230
00:14:31,921 --> 00:14:33,381
-You're here.
-Get over here.

231
00:14:33,465 --> 00:14:35,925
The dead from North Jeolla Province.

232
00:14:36,885 --> 00:14:38,720
Guibanjang, where are we?

233
00:14:39,262 --> 00:14:41,431
The Dream World.
You know the place, right?

234
00:14:42,223 --> 00:14:45,435
You're at the annual
Dream World Lottery Battle.

235
00:14:45,643 --> 00:14:47,687
Think of it as a field day for the dead.

236
00:14:48,188 --> 00:14:49,481
The dead?

237
00:14:50,065 --> 00:14:53,777
-Are you saying that they're all...
-The dead for...

238
00:14:55,904 --> 00:14:56,988
They're playing the lottery?

239
00:14:57,614 --> 00:14:58,948
The winner gets to

240
00:14:59,657 --> 00:15:02,327
enter its descendants dream
to relay the winning numbers.

241
00:15:02,786 --> 00:15:05,413
People who won lotteries
after they dreamed of their ancestors

242
00:15:05,497 --> 00:15:09,042
are all descendants of the people
who won the Lottery Battle.

243
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,503
The dead from North Chungcheong Province.

244
00:15:11,586 --> 00:15:13,463
So are we here to sell snacks?

245
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:15,173
Unbelievable.

246
00:15:17,967 --> 00:15:20,428
Would I be here
if that's all there was to it?

247
00:15:21,012 --> 00:15:23,723
Every one of these people
constantly worry about their descendants.

248
00:15:23,807 --> 00:15:26,518
Escorting the winner
to its descendant's dream

249
00:15:26,601 --> 00:15:28,353
will automatically count as a score.

250
00:15:28,436 --> 00:15:31,731
It'll be the easiest score ever.

251
00:15:31,815 --> 00:15:34,442
-The dead from Jeju Island.
-Table number three.

252
00:15:34,526 --> 00:15:35,735
-Sure.
-Hold on.

253
00:15:36,403 --> 00:15:37,362
Here you go.

254
00:15:37,862 --> 00:15:41,783
The lottery numbers this year
are mine to take.

255
00:15:41,866 --> 00:15:44,702
My grandchildren deserve to be rich too.

256
00:15:44,869 --> 00:15:46,204
-Hey!
-Seriously?

257
00:15:46,287 --> 00:15:48,623
Your descendants can
at least afford a yearly rent.

258
00:15:48,706 --> 00:15:51,584
Mine can still only afford a monthly
rent in a small single-room apartment.

259
00:15:51,668 --> 00:15:53,086
LEE BANG-DEUK

260
00:15:53,169 --> 00:15:58,007
Do you know how painful it is
to have passed down poverty?

261
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:02,220
At least you had something to pass down.

262
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:05,348
My family didn't even have that.

263
00:16:05,974 --> 00:16:07,183
Unbelievable.

264
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:09,811
The rich can survive three generations
after they're ruined,

265
00:16:09,894 --> 00:16:13,815
but poverty can't be escaped
no matter what you do.

266
00:16:14,524 --> 00:16:16,568
Here's your <i>pajeon</i>. Please enjoy.

267
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:19,779
You wait and see. This is the day

268
00:16:19,863 --> 00:16:21,281
that I finally

269
00:16:21,948 --> 00:16:24,951
sever the streak of poverty in my family.

270
00:16:25,034 --> 00:16:29,247
Jin-dong, just you wait!

271
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:31,791
-What?
-Here. Have a drink.

272
00:16:34,335 --> 00:16:35,587
Choi Seok-pan?

273
00:16:36,212 --> 00:16:37,422
Choi Jin-dong?

274
00:16:38,798 --> 00:16:41,968
Are you by any chance related
to Choi Jin-dong who works at Kapeul Mart?

275
00:16:43,595 --> 00:16:45,680
Yes, I am.

276
00:16:46,097 --> 00:16:50,477
How on earth do you know
my great-grandson?

277
00:16:52,228 --> 00:16:53,938
Hello, I'm Han Kang-bae.

278
00:16:54,022 --> 00:16:55,899
I work with Jin-dong.

279
00:16:58,651 --> 00:17:02,155
-Is that so? It's good to meet you.
-Hi.

280
00:17:02,363 --> 00:17:03,656
Hold on.

281
00:17:04,824 --> 00:17:06,618
Why on earth are you here though?

282
00:17:07,202 --> 00:17:10,330
Goodness. And at such a young age too.

283
00:17:10,413 --> 00:17:12,540
You poor thing.

284
00:17:12,624 --> 00:17:15,084
This was the one trip
you should've postponed.

285
00:17:15,668 --> 00:17:16,544
Sorry?

286
00:17:18,379 --> 00:17:20,256
Oh, well, you know how life is.

287
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:23,468
Right, death doesn't hit according to age.

288
00:17:23,551 --> 00:17:26,679
Since you're here though,
do many good deed as you can

289
00:17:26,763 --> 00:17:29,349
to guarantee a long and healthy life
when you're reborn.

290
00:17:29,432 --> 00:17:31,059
-What's your name?
-Han Kang-bae.

291
00:17:31,142 --> 00:17:32,310
Go, Kang-bae!

292
00:17:32,393 --> 00:17:33,436
You too.

293
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:34,729
You can do it!

294
00:17:34,812 --> 00:17:35,855
I can do it.

295
00:17:35,939 --> 00:17:37,357
-Go, go.
-Good luck.

296
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,942
-Go for it.
-Go!

297
00:17:39,025 --> 00:17:42,111
The lowlifes just can't keep it down,
can they?

298
00:17:42,654 --> 00:17:44,739
Kang-bae, come on over and say hello.

299
00:17:44,822 --> 00:17:46,658
2020 DREAM WORLD LOTTERY BATTLE

300
00:17:46,741 --> 00:17:48,952
He's Death from the Yeomra World.

301
00:17:49,536 --> 00:17:50,912
Call him Yeombujang.

302
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:53,790
Death?

303
00:17:56,334 --> 00:17:58,753
-Hello, I'm Han Kang-bae.
-Right.

304
00:17:58,836 --> 00:18:01,714
I saw you once with Ms. Choi

305
00:18:01,923 --> 00:18:04,092
although you probably didn't see me.

306
00:18:04,634 --> 00:18:05,927
Ms. Andong?

307
00:18:06,928 --> 00:18:09,722
Am I able to see you
because I'm in the Dream World?

308
00:18:09,806 --> 00:18:10,890
Bingo.

309
00:18:11,224 --> 00:18:15,061
You'll also see me in the Living Realm
if I'm not doing Death duties though.

310
00:18:15,979 --> 00:18:17,772
We'll grab a drink sometime.

311
00:18:18,273 --> 00:18:22,193
It must be hard to answer
to a temperamental boss.

312
00:18:22,277 --> 00:18:23,611
Your pale face says it all.

313
00:18:24,612 --> 00:18:27,991
Enough with the chit-chat
and begin the race.

314
00:18:28,074 --> 00:18:30,201
-Let's go!
-Go, go!

315
00:18:31,385 --> 00:18:32,928
2020 DREAM WORLD LOTTERY BATTLE

316
00:18:33,012 --> 00:18:35,139
Mic test. One, two. Hi.

317
00:18:35,639 --> 00:18:39,143
The 2020 Dream World Lottery Battle
will soon begin.

318
00:18:39,226 --> 00:18:44,398
Will the ancestors
quickly gather in the field?

319
00:18:44,481 --> 00:18:46,066
Let's do this.

320
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:47,735
-First place, here I come.
-Let's go.

321
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,070
CHOI SEOK-PAN

322
00:18:50,196 --> 00:18:52,198
Let me show them how it's done.

323
00:18:52,281 --> 00:18:54,533
All right, everybody.
Just don't get hurt yourselves.

324
00:18:54,617 --> 00:18:56,785
-Mr. Choi, good luck.
-All right!

325
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:59,455
May the best dead win.

326
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:02,416
KIM DU-YEONG, CHOI SEOK-PAN

327
00:19:02,499 --> 00:19:03,459
Hey!

328
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:05,711
Gosh, he's a nobleman.

329
00:19:10,174 --> 00:19:12,301
-Mr. Choi, good luck.
-Here we go.

330
00:19:13,302 --> 00:19:16,263
May the best dead win!

331
00:19:18,057 --> 00:19:20,309
<i>I'm sure he had his reasons.</i>

332
00:19:22,144 --> 00:19:24,813
-Gosh, don't eat so fast.
-Got it.

333
00:19:25,439 --> 00:19:27,066
-Jin-dong.
-Yes?

334
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:30,194
Just how exactly are they related?

335
00:19:30,527 --> 00:19:33,864
The woman's father
is actually the young guy's birth father.

336
00:19:33,948 --> 00:19:37,076
He had his blood tested to see
if he could donate his liver to his son,

337
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:39,828
but the doctor in charge
is the son's rival.

338
00:19:40,496 --> 00:19:41,622
Is that so?

339
00:19:43,207 --> 00:19:47,211
Then this is what'll obviously happen.
The doctor would fabricate

340
00:19:47,294 --> 00:19:50,547
the father's test results
to help out the young lady.

341
00:19:50,673 --> 00:19:53,425
She'll find out and be torn

342
00:19:53,509 --> 00:19:55,010
with what to do.

343
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:57,638
Gosh, that's the best guess ever.

344
00:19:58,013 --> 00:19:59,682
You could be a screenwriter yourself.

345
00:20:00,266 --> 00:20:01,392
-Right?
-Yes.

346
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,481
Anyway...

347
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:09,984
Here you go.

348
00:20:10,985 --> 00:20:11,986
What's this?

349
00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:19,159
It's for your back surgery.

350
00:20:19,576 --> 00:20:22,788
I've been saving up
and the installments ended this month.

351
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:24,873
It's fine.

352
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:27,293
Your pocket money is yours to spend.

353
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,087
This isn't pocket money.

354
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:31,672
Besides, I'm 29 now.

355
00:20:31,755 --> 00:20:34,508
Exactly. You're 30 soon which means

356
00:20:34,591 --> 00:20:36,427
you should be thinking about marriage.

357
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,178
So save up as much as you can.

358
00:20:38,637 --> 00:20:41,515
It'll be at least ten years
before I get married,

359
00:20:41,598 --> 00:20:44,184
so let's get that
back of yours fixed first.

360
00:20:44,268 --> 00:20:47,604
Hold on. I'm supposed to wait ten years?

361
00:20:47,688 --> 00:20:49,857
You're the worst grandson ever.

362
00:20:51,108 --> 00:20:53,736
So don't be stubborn
and be married by next year.

363
00:20:54,361 --> 00:20:58,282
Please get the surgery
and stop enduring the pain every night.

364
00:20:58,365 --> 00:21:01,660
The doctor said that I'm too old

365
00:21:01,744 --> 00:21:04,455
for the surgery to make a huge difference.

366
00:21:05,164 --> 00:21:07,666
I can manage the pain by taking it easy,

367
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:09,376
so take back the money.

368
00:21:10,836 --> 00:21:12,546
Right now!

369
00:21:13,047 --> 00:21:14,340
Dream World's

370
00:21:14,757 --> 00:21:18,385
true or false quiz!

371
00:21:23,265 --> 00:21:26,143
First category, common knowledge.

372
00:21:26,226 --> 00:21:31,273
Snails have teeth. True or false?

373
00:21:31,357 --> 00:21:32,649
What's the right answer?

374
00:21:32,733 --> 00:21:35,652
Is the statement true or false?

375
00:21:36,653 --> 00:21:38,072
Go!

376
00:21:39,907 --> 00:21:43,118
Snails live off grass,
so of course they need teeth.

377
00:21:43,202 --> 00:21:44,119
How else can they...

378
00:21:44,203 --> 00:21:47,539
I got it. It has to be true.

379
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:52,002
True. It must be true.

380
00:21:52,419 --> 00:21:54,129
It's true!

381
00:21:54,213 --> 00:21:55,339
-Sir.
-Yes?

382
00:21:55,422 --> 00:21:57,633
Step back into the crowd. Back!

383
00:21:58,217 --> 00:22:03,013
It's true!

384
00:22:06,683 --> 00:22:07,893
The answer...

385
00:22:11,772 --> 00:22:12,981
is true!

386
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,485
Nice. I knew it.

387
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:18,779
Of course snails have teeth.

388
00:22:18,862 --> 00:22:21,281
Snails have 10,000 to 25,000 teeth

389
00:22:21,365 --> 00:22:24,785
which makes them
the animal with the most teeth.

390
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:29,289
Those who answered incorrectly
can hop on the Afterlife Express.

2020 DREAM WORLD LOTTERY BATTLE

392
00:22:38,173 --> 00:22:39,341

00:22:52,229 --> 00:22:54,314
Run!

395
00:23:00,195 --> 00:23:01,780
My gosh.

396
00:23:02,573 --> 00:23:03,949
You can do it.

397
00:23:07,995 --> 00:23:08,996
KIM DU-YEONG

398
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:31,727

Damn it!

400
00:23:37,316 --> 00:23:38,525
Seriously?

401
00:23:39,568 --> 00:23:40,611
Oh, no.

402
00:23:40,736 --> 00:23:42,029
You're out.

403
00:23:42,905 --> 00:23:44,615
Just a little bit more.

404
00:23:46,033 --> 00:23:49,286
A man should have a strong back.

405
00:23:50,621 --> 00:23:51,663
Come on.

406
00:23:55,375 --> 00:23:56,585
CHOI SEOK-PAN

407
00:23:57,211 --> 00:23:59,254
-A man with a strong back!
-Good job.

408
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:01,757
A man with a strong back!

409
00:24:02,466 --> 00:24:04,009
KIM DU-YEONG

410
00:24:05,052 --> 00:24:07,471
Good luck. You can do this.

SON JONG-SU, KIM DU-YEONG

412
00:24:11,725 --> 00:24:13,143
You're out.

413
00:24:16,146 --> 00:24:17,898
-Hold on.
-I wasn't watching.

414
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:21,360
You passed!

415
00:24:23,237 --> 00:24:25,030
CHOI SEOK-PAN, KIM DU-YEONG

416
00:24:26,406 --> 00:24:28,158
CHOI SEOK-PAN, KIM DU-YEONG

417
00:24:32,329 --> 00:24:34,665
-Mr. Choi, you can do it!
-You can do it!

418
00:24:34,748 --> 00:24:37,001
-I can do it!
-You've got this.

419

Who will win the lottery numbers?

424
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:50,931

-Go!
-Let's do this!

428
00:25:01,275 --> 00:25:04,903
<i>A nobleman like me can't lose
to someone of a low birth.</i>

429
00:25:05,445 --> 00:25:07,531
<i>I may be of humble birth,</i>

430
00:25:07,614 --> 00:25:09,700
<i>but my love for my descendants
is not humble at all.</i>

431
00:25:09,783 --> 00:25:11,201
<i>I will win this game by all means</i>

Yes! He did it!

467
00:27:40,267 --> 00:27:43,437
What's with you?
It's not like you won the lottery.

468
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,897
He gets worked up over things
that don't concern him.

469
00:27:45,981 --> 00:27:47,983
Things that don't concern me?
I care about Jin-dong!

470
00:27:48,108 --> 00:27:50,318
Jin-dong can finally quit his job now.

471
00:27:50,778 --> 00:27:52,488
Mr. Choi, you can do it!

Kang-bae! I can do it!

473

Well,

484
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:12,442
have all the participants gone back
to the Afterlife?

485
00:29:12,692 --> 00:29:15,320
Yes, except the ones who stayed behind
to clean up.

486
00:29:15,946 --> 00:29:18,824
Shall we get back to work then?

487
00:29:19,616 --> 00:29:20,575
Give me the list.

488
00:29:20,659 --> 00:29:23,245
Sure, here's the list of people
who will die tomorrow.

489
00:29:26,248 --> 00:29:27,582
Let me see.

490
00:29:29,292 --> 00:29:30,252
What's this?

491
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:37,551
Yeombujang, we're back!

492
00:29:37,884 --> 00:29:38,844
Hey.

493
00:29:39,803 --> 00:29:42,806
Well, did everything go well?

494
00:29:42,889 --> 00:29:43,849
Yes.

495
00:29:43,932 --> 00:29:46,101
As always.

496
00:29:46,893 --> 00:29:49,104
Anyway, when Jin-dong wins the lottery,

497
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:51,773
make sure my number goes up right away.

498
00:29:51,857 --> 00:29:53,358
Of course.

499
00:29:53,441 --> 00:29:57,070
You should hurry up and go back
to the Afterlife.

500
00:29:57,153 --> 00:29:59,865
Spending too much time in the Dream World
clouds your spirit.

501
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,283
I will.

502
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:03,201
-Thank you so much.
-I haven't seen this before.

503
00:30:03,285 --> 00:30:04,953
-Is it new?
-Well, yes.

504
00:30:05,996 --> 00:30:09,082
Fancy. I guess the Yeomra Chung
has received some extra funds.

505
00:30:09,165 --> 00:30:10,917
-Please give it back.
-Come on!

506
00:30:15,338 --> 00:30:17,257
CHOI JIN-DONG
APRIL 21, 2020, DEATH BY ACCIDENT

507
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,466
What's this?

508
00:30:19,885 --> 00:30:23,096
Choi Jin-dong is going to die?

509
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,265
-What?
-What did you say?

510
00:30:25,974 --> 00:30:27,559
Jin-dong dies?

511
00:30:28,351 --> 00:30:29,561
What are you talking about?

512
00:30:31,855 --> 00:30:33,940
"April 21"?

513
00:30:34,858 --> 00:30:36,318
That's tomorrow.

514
00:30:36,735 --> 00:30:40,238
No, that can't be right.

515
00:30:40,822 --> 00:30:42,032
He dies?

516
00:30:42,699 --> 00:30:46,077
My sweet little boy, Jin-dong?

517
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:49,789
Why does that poor boy have to die?

518
00:30:49,915 --> 00:30:51,833
-No way.
-Jin-dong!

519
00:30:51,917 --> 00:30:53,335
Jin-dong dies?

520
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:55,962
-Why?
-What about my quota?

521
00:30:56,046 --> 00:30:57,797
Will it go up?

522
00:30:57,881 --> 00:31:00,216
You can forget about it.

523
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:05,805
I made a ton of noodles
and worked my butt off all day!

524
00:31:05,889 --> 00:31:08,099
Ms. Weol-ju, is that
what you're worried about?

525
00:31:08,183 --> 00:31:09,601
What about Jin-dong?

526
00:31:11,811 --> 00:31:16,107
Can you please reconsider it?

527
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:17,567
It's...

528
00:31:18,485 --> 00:31:20,904
not something I can decide.

529
00:31:20,987 --> 00:31:23,990
How could you be so cold?

530
00:31:24,282 --> 00:31:26,242
He was raised by his grandma

531
00:31:26,326 --> 00:31:28,161
in such a shabby house,

532
00:31:28,244 --> 00:31:31,873
but he has never done anything wrong
in his life.

533
00:31:31,957 --> 00:31:36,044
He can't die before he even gets married!

534
00:31:36,419 --> 00:31:39,798
This isn't right!

535
00:31:41,383 --> 00:31:43,593
<i>This is bad.</i>

536
00:31:44,344 --> 00:31:46,262
<i>I'm getting emotional.</i>

537
00:31:46,346 --> 00:31:47,889
I beg you.

538
00:31:48,765 --> 00:31:50,850
Please save him.

539
00:31:50,934 --> 00:31:51,935
Well...

540
00:31:52,811 --> 00:31:55,063
There's one thing you could try.

541
00:32:10,954 --> 00:32:15,125
To change a person's destiny,
you have to change God's mind.

542
00:32:16,001 --> 00:32:20,171
And that takes a great deed
that even God would be touched by.

543
00:32:21,548 --> 00:32:24,426
I've already checked,

544
00:32:26,219 --> 00:32:28,513
and the good deeds you performed
fall far short.

545
00:32:31,266 --> 00:32:33,810
Is there anything I can do?

546
00:32:34,394 --> 00:32:36,521
There is, actually.

547
00:32:36,604 --> 00:32:38,398
-What's that?
-What's that?

548
00:32:39,482 --> 00:32:40,567
What he can do is...

549
00:32:41,192 --> 00:32:42,360
-Well...
-Yes?

550
00:32:42,444 --> 00:32:44,487
-The thing is...
-Gosh!

551
00:32:44,779 --> 00:32:47,615
Hurry up! Are you announcing
an audition winner or something?

552
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:49,492
You're neither Jun Hyun-moo
nor Kim Seong-ju.

553
00:32:49,576 --> 00:32:52,620
I was about to say it. I was, right?

554
00:32:54,414 --> 00:32:55,498
All right.

555
00:32:56,875 --> 00:33:00,712
What you can do is acquire good deeds

556
00:33:00,795 --> 00:33:02,505
from another dead person.

557
00:33:02,589 --> 00:33:06,801
But it's illegal to acquire
good deeds for free.

558
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:11,056
You must give that person
something valuable in return.

559
00:33:14,642 --> 00:33:18,146
I was a servant all my life.

560
00:33:19,355 --> 00:33:21,441
I have nothing valuable.

561
00:33:26,237 --> 00:33:27,280
The winning numbers.

562
00:33:28,323 --> 00:33:30,158
What would money mean
if Jin-dong has to die?

563
00:33:30,241 --> 00:33:32,869
Why don't you exchange
the winning numbers with good deeds?

564
00:33:35,455 --> 00:33:36,414
Can I do that?

565
00:33:36,498 --> 00:33:38,792
Well, it's not impossible.

566
00:33:39,709 --> 00:33:41,920
But the problem is,
money doesn't solve everything here.

567
00:33:42,253 --> 00:33:45,090
What matters the most here
is relationships.

568
00:33:45,882 --> 00:33:48,093
You can only acquire good deeds

569
00:33:48,176 --> 00:33:51,846
from someone who has something
to do with your family.

570
00:33:53,848 --> 00:33:57,393
Gosh, that's it. We can't find
such a person so fast.

571
00:33:57,477 --> 00:33:59,479
Jin-dong has less than a day left.

572
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:05,652
Mr. Choi, you'll have to give up
this time.

573
00:34:05,735 --> 00:34:08,988
Give the winning numbers to your grandson
when he is born again instead.

574
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:13,159
Then at least he will be rich
in his next life. Okay?

575
00:34:14,994 --> 00:34:16,704
I should hurry up and find another case.

576
00:34:16,788 --> 00:34:17,622
Let's go.

577
00:34:18,206 --> 00:34:21,000
Please. Please help me.

578
00:34:22,293 --> 00:34:25,547
As a dead person,
I can't travel back and forth.

579
00:34:26,297 --> 00:34:29,175
Weol-ju, you're the only one
who can help--

580
00:34:29,259 --> 00:34:31,678
I'm on a tight schedule myself.

581
00:34:31,845 --> 00:34:34,389
I'm not a philanthropist
with time on my hands.

582
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:38,685
Without me,
he wouldn't even have been born.

583
00:34:39,602 --> 00:34:43,648
I'd go to hell for him.

584
00:34:45,108 --> 00:34:50,405
Please understand how I feel
as his ancestor.

585
00:35:04,961 --> 00:35:06,337
Mother!

586
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:08,381
Mother, no!

587
00:35:09,048 --> 00:35:12,969
Mother, wake up!

588
00:35:15,638 --> 00:35:16,764
Mother!

589
00:35:23,646 --> 00:35:24,772
In my next life,

590
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:28,651
I'll be your slave.

591
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:31,196
Please...

592
00:35:31,988 --> 00:35:35,700
Please save my little boy.

593
00:35:39,829 --> 00:35:42,457
Slavery's been abolished.
That's so old-fashioned.

594
00:35:44,417 --> 00:35:45,460
Fine.

595
00:35:46,085 --> 00:35:48,963
After all that hard work,
I can't give up so easily.

596
00:35:49,047 --> 00:35:50,673
Thank you.

597
00:35:51,299 --> 00:35:52,383
Goodness.

598
00:35:53,384 --> 00:35:55,762
Thank you so much.

599
00:35:56,221 --> 00:35:59,807
Hurry up and go back to the Afterlife now.

600
00:35:59,933 --> 00:36:01,351
Your spirit is becoming weak.

601
00:36:02,602 --> 00:36:06,439
Thank you so much.

602
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:14,030
Choi Jin-dong, Kapeul Mart,

603
00:36:14,113 --> 00:36:16,741
11:03 a.m., an accidental death.

604
00:36:16,991 --> 00:36:19,327
Be sure to bring good deeds by then.

605
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:22,163
Okay, got it.

606
00:36:22,247 --> 00:36:23,998
Even if you're just a second late,

607
00:36:24,082 --> 00:36:26,834
there will be nothing I can do.

608
00:36:32,674 --> 00:36:34,092
AFTERLIFE CITY HALL

609
00:36:34,175 --> 00:36:38,137
I need to view a family register
and the good deeds records.

610
00:36:38,221 --> 00:36:39,264
Can I get the keys?

611
00:36:39,347 --> 00:36:41,057
We don't have the reference room anymore.

612
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:42,058
-Pardon?
-Pardon?

613
00:36:42,141 --> 00:36:44,894
What happened?
Was there a fire or something?

614
00:36:44,978 --> 00:36:47,855
You didn't know? We have a new coworker
who has amazing computer skills.

615
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:51,109
He computerized our old database.

616
00:36:52,151 --> 00:36:53,695
That's him over there.

617
00:37:02,412 --> 00:37:05,915
Can you find someone who has records
of good deeds and has something to do

618
00:37:05,999 --> 00:37:07,000
with Mr. Choi Seok-pan?

619
00:37:07,083 --> 00:37:08,459
Just a second, please.

620
00:37:09,627 --> 00:37:10,712
CHOI SEOK-PAN

621
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:15,091
CHOI SEOK-PAN

622
00:37:18,386 --> 00:37:19,512
CHOI SEOK-PAN

623
00:37:19,595 --> 00:37:20,930
HOLDER OF GOOD DEEDS

624
00:37:21,806 --> 00:37:23,891
KIM CHEOL-HYEON

625
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:25,268
Gosh, that's fast.

626
00:37:25,351 --> 00:37:29,439
LEE JEOM-RYE

627
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:31,107
"Lee Kkeut-sun."

628
00:37:31,774 --> 00:37:35,570
She sure did many good deeds.

629
00:37:35,737 --> 00:37:37,905
Yes. With so many good deeds,

630
00:37:38,573 --> 00:37:41,743
she'll probably be a billionaire
in her next life.

631
00:37:42,702 --> 00:37:44,287
A billionaire?

632
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:46,497
Your good deeds affect your next life?

633
00:37:46,873 --> 00:37:49,000
That's why people regret

634
00:37:49,083 --> 00:37:51,919
not doing more good deeds while alive
when they enter the Afterlife.

635
00:37:52,003 --> 00:37:54,589
Here, good deeds
are more valuable than anything.

636
00:37:54,714 --> 00:37:58,217
People would steal them if they could.

637
00:37:58,968 --> 00:38:01,137
Where can we find her?

638
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:05,475
AFTERLIFE ORPHANAGE

639
00:38:09,062 --> 00:38:10,646
There's an orphanage here?

640
00:38:11,773 --> 00:38:14,275
The spirits of children
who died before their parents stay here.

641
00:38:17,445 --> 00:38:18,863
-Who are you?
-Who are you?

642
00:38:18,946 --> 00:38:20,698
-Who are we?
-May I help you?

643
00:38:21,491 --> 00:38:22,617
Hello.

644
00:38:23,159 --> 00:38:24,744
We're from the Dream World.

645
00:38:24,827 --> 00:38:27,455
Can we have a word
with Director Lee Kkeut-sun?

646
00:38:27,538 --> 00:38:31,250
She's talking to someone right now.
You'll have to wait.

647
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:33,586
Have the kids eaten yet?

648
00:38:33,669 --> 00:38:35,838
It's lunchtime soon.

649
00:38:35,922 --> 00:38:37,757
Do we have any ingredients left?

650
00:39:05,451 --> 00:39:06,702
Enjoy.

651
00:39:06,786 --> 00:39:07,787
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

652
00:39:09,247 --> 00:39:10,415
Enjoy, guys!

653
00:39:10,498 --> 00:39:13,167
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

654
00:39:13,626 --> 00:39:14,919
Eat slowly.

655
00:39:16,337 --> 00:39:18,339
-Guys, eat slowly.
-There's more.

656
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:21,050
Tell me if you want more.

657
00:39:21,717 --> 00:39:22,844
Is it tasty?

658
00:39:24,387 --> 00:39:25,680
You wanted to see me?

659
00:39:35,189 --> 00:39:36,149
Pardon?

660
00:39:36,649 --> 00:39:40,111
Her grandson must still be young.

661
00:39:41,404 --> 00:39:42,989
Poor Jeom-rye.

662
00:39:45,867 --> 00:39:49,078
We're here to ask you a favor.

663
00:39:49,162 --> 00:39:52,790
Is there something I can do?

664
00:39:52,874 --> 00:39:54,792
Please tell me what I can do.

665
00:39:56,836 --> 00:39:59,380
We can save him
if you share your good deeds with us.

666
00:40:00,047 --> 00:40:04,343
You did countless good deeds in your life.

667
00:40:04,844 --> 00:40:07,430
I'm sure even God would be moved.

668
00:40:08,181 --> 00:40:10,933
You can have them. Of course.

669
00:40:11,017 --> 00:40:14,979
I owe Jeom-rye so much.

670
00:40:20,276 --> 00:40:21,277
Here is

671
00:40:21,903 --> 00:40:25,114
a winning lottery ticket
from Jeom-rye's father-in-law.

672
00:40:25,198 --> 00:40:26,991
I can't take it.

673
00:40:27,074 --> 00:40:29,494
You have to
according to the Afterlife law.

674
00:40:29,577 --> 00:40:30,995
Do whatever you want with it.

675
00:40:31,954 --> 00:40:34,665
Well, if you insist.

676
00:40:36,209 --> 00:40:38,669
All right, here you go.

677
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:41,005
GOOD DEEDS

678
00:40:41,088 --> 00:40:45,009
Please take good care of Jeom-rye.

679
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:54,977
Jin-dong, come have breakfast.
It's almost time for work.

680
00:40:57,188 --> 00:40:58,940
-Grandma.
-Yes?

681
00:40:59,106 --> 00:40:59,982
Give me a pen.

682
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:02,318
A pen and a piece of paper. Hurry.

683
00:41:02,401 --> 00:41:04,278
-Why?
-Give me a pen and a piece of paper.

684
00:41:04,362 --> 00:41:05,988
What's with you?

685
00:41:06,072 --> 00:41:07,698
Let me see. Where are they?
There they are.

686
00:41:07,782 --> 00:41:09,867
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

687
00:41:10,409 --> 00:41:11,536
My goodness.

688
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:16,082
What's that? What are you writing down?

689
00:41:18,584 --> 00:41:21,212
In my dream last night, an old man...

690
00:41:21,921 --> 00:41:24,423
Wait, if I talk about it,
it might become useless.

691
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:28,344
It's nothing. I'll tell you later.

692
00:41:32,932 --> 00:41:35,434
How do you feel
having visited the Afterlife?

693
00:41:36,227 --> 00:41:37,937
You must be the first living person

694
00:41:38,688 --> 00:41:39,897
who has ever been here.

695
00:41:41,649 --> 00:41:44,277
I don't feel very happy.
I feel sorry for those kids.

696
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:47,446
I hope Director Lee
takes good care of them.

697
00:41:47,947 --> 00:41:49,782
They wait there until their parents come.

698
00:41:50,283 --> 00:41:53,119
Will they meet their parents someday?

699
00:41:54,161 --> 00:41:57,832
Yes, everyone dies someday,

700
00:41:58,249 --> 00:41:59,584
so they eventually meet.

701
00:42:01,627 --> 00:42:02,545
That's a relief.

702
00:42:03,546 --> 00:42:04,964
It's different in the Living Realm.

703
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:06,591
What do you mean?

704
00:42:06,674 --> 00:42:09,719
In the Living Realm,
most kids at orphanages

705
00:42:10,636 --> 00:42:13,639
never meet their parents again
no matter how long they wait.

706
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:18,477
And I was one of them.

707
00:42:35,703 --> 00:42:36,829
I hope we can make it.

708
00:42:38,372 --> 00:42:40,124
Let me see. The sun is...

709
00:42:41,417 --> 00:42:44,795
We have more than enough time
before his expected time of death.

710
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:47,548
I'm hot and thirsty.

711
00:42:48,132 --> 00:42:49,258
Here's some barley tea.

712
00:42:59,644 --> 00:43:01,187
The good deeds pouch!

713
00:43:01,812 --> 00:43:03,648
Thief! Get him!

714
00:43:03,731 --> 00:43:05,107
Hey, stop right there!

715
00:43:08,736 --> 00:43:10,196
Hey, Kang-bae!

716
00:43:11,405 --> 00:43:12,239
We need to get back.

717
00:43:12,323 --> 00:43:14,867
-What about the good deeds?
-We don't have time.

718
00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:17,953
Let's go back and protect Jin-dong.

719
00:43:21,314 --> 00:43:23,399
KAPEUL MART

720
00:43:28,321 --> 00:43:29,948
<i>I'll stop Death from the outside.</i>

721
00:43:30,031 --> 00:43:32,283
<i>You stay inside
and keep an eye on Choi Jin-dong.</i>

722
00:43:38,164 --> 00:43:39,457
Hey, Jin-dong.

723
00:43:40,166 --> 00:43:42,418
Why didn't you pick up your phone?
I was worried.

724
00:43:44,546 --> 00:43:46,422
Sorry, my phone was on silent.
What's the matter?

725
00:43:47,966 --> 00:43:49,342
I was just worried about you.

726
00:43:50,135 --> 00:43:52,387
How are you feeling today?
Are you sick or anything?

727
00:43:52,470 --> 00:43:53,930
What's with you?

728
00:43:55,849 --> 00:43:56,850
You...

729
00:43:59,185 --> 00:44:01,062
How did you know I bought this?

730
00:44:02,564 --> 00:44:03,690
A lottery ticket?

731
00:44:08,027 --> 00:44:11,614
The thing is, I had
an extraordinary dream last night.

732
00:44:13,366 --> 00:44:14,576
You'll see.

733
00:44:15,368 --> 00:44:16,744
If I win the lottery,

734
00:44:17,537 --> 00:44:19,581
I'll take you on a trip to Hawaii.

735
00:44:21,416 --> 00:44:22,584
Hawaii?

736
00:44:23,251 --> 00:44:24,586
That sounds awesome.

737
00:44:24,836 --> 00:44:27,172
I can't wait.

738
00:44:36,431 --> 00:44:37,599
This one?

739
00:44:42,145 --> 00:44:44,355
Wait, ma'am! I'm sorry.

740
00:44:44,439 --> 00:44:45,523
What's with you?

741
00:44:45,607 --> 00:44:46,733
I'm always like this.

742
00:44:47,358 --> 00:44:49,068
Where are you going? That way, please.

743
00:44:57,869 --> 00:44:58,828
Gosh.

744
00:45:00,205 --> 00:45:02,207
What's going on?

745
00:45:04,292 --> 00:45:05,752
I'm stretching.

746
00:45:06,794 --> 00:45:08,379
Stretching is the best.

747
00:45:09,923 --> 00:45:11,424
-Join me.
-Forget it.

748
00:45:30,652 --> 00:45:32,070
CHOI JIN-DONG

749
00:45:32,153 --> 00:45:33,279
Choi Jin-dong.

750
00:45:36,074 --> 00:45:39,369
Life and death are in the hands of God.
There's nothing I can do.

751
00:45:40,578 --> 00:45:41,913
I'm sorry, Seok-pan.

752
00:45:46,459 --> 00:45:47,460
Gosh, you startled me.

753
00:45:47,543 --> 00:45:49,879
Why are you so early?

754
00:45:49,963 --> 00:45:52,131
A gentleman should always be

755
00:45:52,799 --> 00:45:54,133
ten minutes early.

756
00:45:55,093 --> 00:45:58,388
The good deeds pouch will be here soon.
Just hold on a second.

757
00:45:58,888 --> 00:46:01,683
Didn't I tell you not to be
even a second late?

758
00:46:06,312 --> 00:46:08,481
Why are you glaring at me again?
Are you going to hit me?

759
00:46:08,564 --> 00:46:11,609
I've always wanted to hit you,

760
00:46:11,693 --> 00:46:13,152
but I've never had any excuse.

761
00:46:13,236 --> 00:46:14,404
But if I hit you on the job,

762
00:46:14,487 --> 00:46:17,115
wouldn't that count
as an extenuating circumstance?

763
00:46:18,116 --> 00:46:21,411
Hold on. Why would you clench your fists?

764
00:46:21,494 --> 00:46:22,704
Is that Choi Jin-dong?

765
00:46:25,248 --> 00:46:26,332
Gosh!

766
00:46:36,759 --> 00:46:39,804
Jin-dong, let's get out of here.
This place is way too dangerous.

767
00:46:40,471 --> 00:46:42,223
The warehouse? All of a sudden?

768
00:46:42,807 --> 00:46:45,143
Yes. I'm getting so anxious.

769
00:46:46,352 --> 00:46:49,355
If you want to get out of here,
hurry up and help me.

770
00:47:10,752 --> 00:47:12,587
No!

771
00:47:16,424 --> 00:47:17,842
Jin-dong!

772
00:47:33,816 --> 00:47:35,401
Jin-dong!

773
00:47:36,069 --> 00:47:37,862
Gosh. Jin-dong.

774
00:47:41,366 --> 00:47:44,285
Jin-dong! Wake up!

775
00:47:44,369 --> 00:47:45,661
Wake up!

776
00:47:49,165 --> 00:47:51,292
Did you wake up? Do you recognize me?

777
00:47:51,376 --> 00:47:53,961
I've been on more than 50
blind dates so far,

778
00:47:54,045 --> 00:47:55,671
and I've been shut down every single time.

779
00:47:55,755 --> 00:47:57,340
Can you believe that?

780
00:47:58,174 --> 00:48:00,259
What? What are you talking about...

781
00:48:04,639 --> 00:48:06,891
Am I that unattractive?

782
00:48:07,767 --> 00:48:09,811
I really don't understand girls.

783
00:48:10,812 --> 00:48:11,771
I see.

784
00:48:11,854 --> 00:48:13,314
The first girl...

785
00:48:13,398 --> 00:48:16,317
Hey! Get off me!

786
00:48:16,401 --> 00:48:17,610
If I do, you'll take him.

787
00:48:18,111 --> 00:48:19,821
I have no choice.

788
00:48:19,904 --> 00:48:21,948
It's his destiny. Get off me!

789
00:48:22,031 --> 00:48:23,449
Whatever, I don't care.

790
00:48:24,158 --> 00:48:25,701
What? Unbelievable.

791
00:48:25,785 --> 00:48:28,204
-Is that how you talk to Death?
-That's right.

792
00:48:28,287 --> 00:48:31,624
After 500 years in the Living Realm,
I'm not afraid of anything anymore.

793
00:48:31,707 --> 00:48:33,126
My goodness.

794
00:48:34,127 --> 00:48:35,461
-Move!
-Gosh!

795
00:48:39,674 --> 00:48:41,384
What's taking Guibanjang so long?

796
00:48:51,185 --> 00:48:52,937
Special larceny
and obstruction of justice.

797
00:48:53,604 --> 00:48:55,606
If something happens to Choi Jin-dong,

798
00:48:56,023 --> 00:48:57,608
you'll be charged with murder too.

799
00:48:59,902 --> 00:49:01,070
TO THE LIVING REALM

800
00:49:01,154 --> 00:49:02,613
When is the next ferry?

801
00:49:05,199 --> 00:49:06,451
In two hours?

802
00:49:08,202 --> 00:49:11,080
When so many people die every day,
shouldn't it run more frequently?

803
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:14,417
This is bad. There's not much time left.

804
00:49:26,888 --> 00:49:28,973
Whatever, I'll give it a try.

805
00:49:44,822 --> 00:49:46,199
Gosh, my back.

806
00:49:46,449 --> 00:49:49,368
How could you shove me
to the floor like that?

807
00:49:50,786 --> 00:49:54,916
You were about to run the guy over
with that cart.

808
00:49:57,543 --> 00:50:00,630
How do you feel
now that you got your butt kicked by me?

809
00:50:00,713 --> 00:50:01,672
Thanks.

810
00:50:02,298 --> 00:50:03,883
I have to submit a written apology now.

811
00:50:03,966 --> 00:50:07,762
Don't worry. I've submitted
countless apologies so far.

812
00:50:07,845 --> 00:50:10,723
I'll send over the best ones
so you can copy them.

813
00:50:10,932 --> 00:50:13,309
There's no need. While I'm at it,

814
00:50:13,559 --> 00:50:15,686
one more written apology won't hurt.

815
00:50:15,770 --> 00:50:17,563
You brought it on yourself.

816
00:50:17,647 --> 00:50:19,607
ACCIDENTAL DEATH

817
00:50:20,191 --> 00:50:21,567
HEART

818
00:50:23,486 --> 00:50:24,987
HEART ATTACK

819
00:50:25,071 --> 00:50:27,782
I changed the cause of death.

820
00:50:33,204 --> 00:50:34,830
Why do you keep cutting in?

821
00:50:35,498 --> 00:50:36,415
Gosh.

822
00:50:41,837 --> 00:50:43,339
-Who's there?
-What?

823
00:50:48,427 --> 00:50:50,096
What's wrong with this? Is it broken?

824
00:50:54,475 --> 00:50:55,685
Oh, no.

825
00:50:58,062 --> 00:50:59,105
Gosh.

826
00:51:00,273 --> 00:51:01,899
Be quiet.

827
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:17,748
<i>Kang Yeo-rin.
The elevator on the first floor is broken.</i>

828
00:51:17,832 --> 00:51:19,667
<i>Restrict customers from using it.</i>

829
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:20,835
Yes, sir.

830
00:51:29,635 --> 00:51:30,678
Gosh.

831
00:51:33,973 --> 00:51:35,057
It used to work fine.

832
00:51:35,558 --> 00:51:37,268
What's wrong with this? Gosh.

833
00:51:44,191 --> 00:51:45,234
My stomach feels bloated.

834
00:51:45,943 --> 00:51:47,570
Was the food too salty?

835
00:51:50,698 --> 00:51:52,908
Did I eat too much sodium yesterday?

836
00:51:53,534 --> 00:51:54,994
Stop it already.

837
00:51:55,369 --> 00:51:57,872
This time I'll blow you away at one go.

838
00:52:06,255 --> 00:52:07,923
Wait!

839
00:52:40,956 --> 00:52:41,832
Here.

840
00:52:42,917 --> 00:52:44,001
Here's the good deed.

841
00:53:23,666 --> 00:53:25,960
Goodness. My back.

842
00:53:29,046 --> 00:53:31,882
Goodness, I'm tired.

843
00:53:39,682 --> 00:53:40,599
Jeom-rye.

844
00:53:45,646 --> 00:53:46,731
Jeom-rye.

845
00:53:48,315 --> 00:53:49,358
Goodness.

846
00:53:49,817 --> 00:53:50,693
Does it hurt a lot?

847
00:53:50,776 --> 00:53:52,945
It comes with the old age, you know.

848
00:53:54,447 --> 00:53:58,242
But life is good because I have Jin-dong.

849
00:53:58,617 --> 00:53:59,577
Yes.

850
00:53:59,994 --> 00:54:01,245
That's good to hear.

851
00:54:01,746 --> 00:54:04,331
You should take care of yourself.

852
00:54:04,874 --> 00:54:06,751
Did you eat?

853
00:54:07,126 --> 00:54:09,086
I'll make you some noodles.

854
00:54:09,170 --> 00:54:10,713
It's okay. I already ate.

855
00:54:12,381 --> 00:54:13,382
Goodness.

856
00:54:14,592 --> 00:54:16,135
Thank you, Jeom-rye.

857
00:54:16,719 --> 00:54:20,765
Thanks to you, I lived a fruitful

858
00:54:21,098 --> 00:54:24,685
and worthwhile life.

859
00:54:24,894 --> 00:54:27,563
Let's not talk about the old days.
You're making me blush.

860
00:54:31,901 --> 00:54:36,530
I'm sleepy because I cleaned the fridge
this afternoon.

861
00:54:37,281 --> 00:54:38,783
-Goodness, my baby.
-Gosh.

862
00:54:40,117 --> 00:54:41,118
Goodness.

863
00:54:44,413 --> 00:54:46,665
Everything will be fine, Jeom-rye.

864
00:54:49,376 --> 00:54:50,795
Until you come,

865
00:54:52,421 --> 00:54:55,925
live healthy and well.

866
00:55:10,481 --> 00:55:13,317
Wasn't that the panacea?

867
00:55:13,442 --> 00:55:14,652
It's hard to get.

868
00:55:14,735 --> 00:55:18,405
Yes, I bought it with the lottery numbers.

869
00:55:19,114 --> 00:55:22,451
Because I heard Jeom-rye has a bad back.

870
00:55:23,494 --> 00:55:24,620
You did a good thing.

871
00:55:24,703 --> 00:55:26,080
Isn't it interesting

872
00:55:27,039 --> 00:55:30,042
how we can help each other like this

873
00:55:30,793 --> 00:55:33,337
thanks to our relationship
from the Living Realm?

874
00:55:34,004 --> 00:55:34,839
You're right.

875
00:55:36,924 --> 00:55:40,970
So everyone needs to get a hold
of themselves and live a good life.

876
00:55:41,262 --> 00:55:44,056
Saying something nice to someone

877
00:55:44,139 --> 00:55:48,561
and sincerely helping someone
all come back like this.

878
00:55:49,478 --> 00:55:50,521
That's right.

879
00:55:52,273 --> 00:55:55,234
That's the way to live.

880
00:56:03,284 --> 00:56:04,994
Grandma, I'm home.

881
00:56:08,831 --> 00:56:11,292
Goodness, I dozed off.

882
00:56:12,668 --> 00:56:13,752
Gosh.

883
00:56:13,836 --> 00:56:15,170
Grandma, I'm hungry.

884
00:56:15,254 --> 00:56:18,883
I'll get you something to eat,
my sweet pumpkin.

885
00:56:18,966 --> 00:56:20,050
ROTTO
LOTTERY WINNING NUMBERS

886
00:56:20,134 --> 00:56:22,803
ROTTO
LOTTERY WINNING NUMBERS

887
00:56:22,887 --> 00:56:25,014
Darn, no match.

888
00:56:26,265 --> 00:56:28,225
I thought my ancestors would help me.

889
00:56:29,101 --> 00:56:30,060
I thought so, too.

890
00:56:30,477 --> 00:56:31,854
Why did they come

891
00:56:31,937 --> 00:56:33,814
and make you get your hopes up?

892
00:56:34,982 --> 00:56:38,277
Grandma, leave it there. Let me do it.

893
00:56:38,402 --> 00:56:39,403
Wait a minute.

894
00:56:43,657 --> 00:56:45,534
-Well...
-My back doesn't hurt.

895
00:56:46,535 --> 00:56:47,995
What? Wait.

896
00:56:48,078 --> 00:56:50,664
-It doesn't hurt? Really?
-Really. Wait.

897
00:56:52,708 --> 00:56:53,792
What?

898
00:56:53,876 --> 00:56:55,210
-It doesn't hurt.
-Can you do this?

899
00:56:55,294 --> 00:56:56,754
-Yes.
-Really?

900
00:56:56,837 --> 00:56:59,423
-It doesn't hurt at all.
-How can this happen?

901
00:56:59,548 --> 00:57:01,634
This is strange. It's really weird.

902
00:57:01,717 --> 00:57:05,095
The ancestor must've fixed my back
instead of letting us win the lottery.

903
00:57:05,429 --> 00:57:07,181
That's really great!

904
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:12,186
Gosh.

905
00:57:26,575 --> 00:57:27,993
Hey.

906
00:57:28,744 --> 00:57:31,372
Are you having fun?
You should peel the onions.

907
00:57:32,957 --> 00:57:34,583
I've finished.

908
00:57:38,796 --> 00:57:41,382
My goodness.
You have to peel the garlic, too.

909
00:57:41,465 --> 00:57:43,550
They're done too.

910
00:57:44,385 --> 00:57:47,262
-What about the potatoes?
-Of course.

911
00:57:48,472 --> 00:57:51,392
I see. Then,

912
00:57:54,937 --> 00:57:56,605
remove the poop from dried anchovies.

913
00:57:57,606 --> 00:57:59,483
Hey, don't you think this is too much?

914
00:57:59,566 --> 00:58:02,903
I used to be a detective squad chief
at the Afterlife Police Agency.

915
00:58:02,987 --> 00:58:04,905
I shouldn't be doing this.

916
00:58:04,989 --> 00:58:06,407
But you aren't the chief now.

917
00:58:07,491 --> 00:58:10,703
If I hadn't been transferred here,

918
00:58:10,786 --> 00:58:13,539
I would've been the chief of police.

919
00:58:13,622 --> 00:58:15,791
-You can complain then.
-What?

920
00:58:16,333 --> 00:58:18,752
You can complain
when you're the chief of police.

921
00:58:21,046 --> 00:58:22,214
Okay.

922
00:58:22,798 --> 00:58:24,508
I'll remove the poop.

923
00:58:25,467 --> 00:58:28,595
<i>If you say so
I'll have to do it</i>

924
00:58:28,679 --> 00:58:31,390
There are so many. Gosh.

925
00:58:32,099 --> 00:58:34,768
What have I done to deserve this?

926
00:58:36,186 --> 00:58:40,691
<i>Remove the poop</i>

927
00:58:40,774 --> 00:58:42,693
<i>Love, love, love</i>

928
00:58:42,818 --> 00:58:46,030
<i>It's poop of love</i>

929
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:48,699
Ms. Weol-ju.

930
00:58:49,825 --> 00:58:51,785
I finished sweeping outside.

931
00:58:51,869 --> 00:58:53,662
-Hey. What's wrong with him?
-What?

932
00:58:53,746 --> 00:58:54,830
-Kang-bae.
-Kang-bae.

933
00:58:54,913 --> 00:58:56,832
Hey, get up. Sit here.

934
00:58:56,957 --> 00:58:58,709
-I'm okay.
-Are you okay?

935
00:58:59,043 --> 00:59:01,962
Wait. His body is burning up.

936
00:59:02,046 --> 00:59:03,756
He must've worked too hard
the past few days.

937
00:59:06,050 --> 00:59:07,217
-What should we do?
-All right.

938
00:59:07,843 --> 00:59:11,388
I'll take him home. You clean up.

939
00:59:11,472 --> 00:59:13,057
-What?
-Come here. Let's go.

940
00:59:13,140 --> 00:59:15,642
Hey. Can you take him alone?

941
00:59:15,726 --> 00:59:16,602
Bye.

942
00:59:16,685 --> 00:59:18,437
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

943
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:19,438
Okay.

944
00:59:20,147 --> 00:59:21,940
Call me if anything happens.

945
00:59:25,402 --> 00:59:26,779
Kang-bae.

946
00:59:27,821 --> 00:59:28,864
Hey.

947
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:32,701
Is the part-timer sick?
Where are they going?

948
00:59:32,785 --> 00:59:35,245
Yes, I think he's sick
because he's overworked.

949
00:59:37,998 --> 00:59:39,875
No wonder he has no energy.

950
00:59:40,459 --> 00:59:42,044
A living person crossed

951
00:59:42,127 --> 00:59:45,172
the River of Oblivion to the Afterlife
and came back to the Living Realm.

952
00:59:46,048 --> 00:59:47,758
He's really unusual, isn't he?

953
00:59:48,717 --> 00:59:51,929
Anyway, Choi Seok-pan says thanks.

954
00:59:52,262 --> 00:59:54,556
Kim Du-yeong was sentenced accordingly.

955
00:59:54,681 --> 00:59:55,766
I see.

956
00:59:58,644 --> 01:00:01,814
By the way, how did you end up
removing anchovy poop?

957
01:00:03,649 --> 01:00:06,276
Say no more. I've heard enough.

958
01:00:07,903 --> 01:00:10,697
Gosh, you used to be
a detective squad chief

959
01:00:10,781 --> 01:00:12,241
catching evil spirits.

960
01:00:13,784 --> 01:00:15,828
Well, this is fun, too.

961
01:00:15,911 --> 01:00:18,080
-Would you like to try?
-No.

962
01:00:18,622 --> 01:00:19,623
By the way,

963
01:00:19,832 --> 01:00:23,544
the police chief mentioned about
your reinstatement.

964
01:00:30,092 --> 01:00:32,261
Later. It's too soon.

965
01:00:34,096 --> 01:00:35,097
Come on.

966
01:00:39,434 --> 01:00:42,020
Well, talk of the Devil.

967
01:00:43,147 --> 01:00:44,690
Hello? Yes, Chief.

968
01:00:45,357 --> 01:00:46,191
Where?

969
01:00:47,526 --> 01:00:49,528
Okay. I'll be there, sir.

970
01:00:52,406 --> 01:00:54,992
Hey, there's an evil spirit in the area.

971
01:00:55,742 --> 01:00:56,785
Let's go.

972
01:00:56,869 --> 01:00:58,078
Me?

973
01:00:59,663 --> 01:01:02,416
Having wrestled Weol-ju at this age

974
01:01:02,499 --> 01:01:04,209
really wore me out.

975
01:01:04,293 --> 01:01:07,421
Think of it as being respectful
to your elders and come with me.

976
01:03:03,036 --> 01:03:05,497
Gosh, my back.

977
01:03:25,809 --> 01:03:28,645
