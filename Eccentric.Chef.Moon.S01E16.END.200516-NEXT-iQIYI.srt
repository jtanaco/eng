<b>Are you leaving already?</b>

354
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:38,755
<b>I'm afraid I have to. I have work to do.</b>

355
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,555
<b>Why don't you have some food
before you go?</b>

356
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:44,289
<b>I wish I could.
I don't get to eat your food often.</b>

357

<b>What a shame.</b>

358
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,865
<b>But there's nothing we can do about it.
He's the chairman now. He's busy.</b>

359
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:52,735
<b>Come on, Gun-woo.
I will come back some other time.</b>

<b>Okay.</b>

361
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:57,139
<b>I heard Hyun-a was released
from the police station.</b>

362
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,535
<b>So I think I should go.</b>

363
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:01,675
<b>- Chef Moon, sorry I have to leave early.
- Don't worry.</b>

364

<b>- Keep me updated.
- I will. Let's go.</b>

365
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:07,315
<b>Okay. We will get going then.</b>

366
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:09,889
<b>- The soup smells great.
- Come on.</b>

367
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:10,985
<b>Bye.</b>

368
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:18,629
<b>Guys, I think we should get started.</b>

369
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:20,629
<b>- Okay.
- When should we start?</b>

370
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:22,429
<b>Two dishes after this,
we're getting desserts.</b>

371
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:25,639
<b>When we get the desserts,
we will introduce Chef Moon and Byeol-na.</b>

372
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,069
<b>- Then boom!
- Exactly.</b>

373
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:30,339
<b>That's the moment of tears.</b>

374
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,575
<b>- Exactly.
- Right.</b>

375
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:35,345
<b>Now, let's start getting ready.</b>

376
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:37,275
<b>Gosh, this is exciting.</b>

377
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:41,485
<b>What's wrong?</b>

378
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:46,959
<b>We are in trouble.
The flash drive is gone.</b>

379
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,359
<b>- What?
- Hey!</b>

380
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,829
<b>Did you search everywhere?</b>

381
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:52,659
<b>- It's gone.
[ - What do we do now? ]</b>

382
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:53,999
<b>Does that mean we can't play it now?</b>

383
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,599
<b>But now is the perfect time to play it.</b>

384
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,199
<b>I have the file at home.
I will quickly go and get it.</b>

385
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,309
<b>Da-hoon, let me come with you.</b>

386
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:02,539
<b>No, you're too slow.</b>

387
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:04,935
<b>But I can't trust you!</b>

388
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:07,339
<b>What if you drop it somewhere
on your way back?</b>

389
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:10,279
<b>- Hurry up.
- Just go already. We don't have time.</b>

390
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,715
<b>- Make sure to come back in 10.
- Now go.</b>

391
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,315
<b>- Is everything okay?
- Yes.</b>

392
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:33,099
<b>This is why I said I can't trust you.</b>

393
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:35,605
<b>Seol-a, I don't think I can do this.</b>

394
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:40,139
<b>Go and bring the laptop on my desk.</b>

395
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:42,505
<b>Okay. You can count on me!</b>

396
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:17,875
<b>Who are you?</b>

397
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:33,159
<b>- What do we do?
- What's taking them so long?</b>

398
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,825
<b>The dinner is almost over.
Why aren't they coming?</b>

399
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:37,895
<b>Call him.</b>

400
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:43,605
<b>Hold on.</b>

401
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:46,679
<b>He left his phone here.</b>

402
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:49,149
<b>When they get back,
no one will be left here.</b>

403
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:50,579
<b>What should we do?</b>

404
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:54,279
<b>- I guess it's time for me to step up.
- What?</b>

405
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:57,915
<b>I, Bong-doo, am the master of stalling.</b>

406
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:03,055
<b>Ladies and gentlemen.</b>

407
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:06,855
<b>- Well...
- Fire!</b>

408
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:08,569
<b>- What?
- Pungcheonok!</b>

409
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:10,969
<b>- There's a fire at Pungcheonok!
- What?</b>

410
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:13,299
<b>- What?
- But Da-hoon and Seol-a are there!</b>

411
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,905
<b>- What?
- What happened?</b>

412
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,509
<b>Did Seol-a and Da-hoon go to Pungcheonok?</b>

<b>Da-hoon!</b>

420
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:32,089
<b>What are you doing here?</b>

421
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:33,289
<b>I'm waiting for Seol-a.</b>

422
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:35,259
<b>I got tired, so I asked her

<b>Hey!</b>

424
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:39,299

00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,065

<b>I know you want to kill me right now.</b>

<b>You're right.</b>

513
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:16,185
<b>I changed so much after meeting you.</b>

514
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:19,085
<b>I'm no longer anorexic,</b>

515
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,755
<b>and I'm no longer afraid

516
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:24,025
<b>And you're now a designer with a face.</b>

517
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:26,525
<b>You changed a lot too.</b>

518
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:28,525
<b>How?</b>

519
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:33,765
<b>You're now Chef Moon and a dad.</b>

520
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,405
<b>You're right.</b>

521
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:41,275
<b>Before I met you,</b>

522
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:44,605
<b>I was just a wandering chef.</b>

523
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:48,985
<b>But now, I'm rooted in Seoha Village,</b>

524

<b>am a father of a child,</b>

525

<b>own a restaurant

527
00:37:58,730 --> 00:38:02,865
<b>and Yoo Byeol-na's love, Chef Moon.</b>

528
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,495
<b>You're right.</b>

529
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:07,665
<b>To be honest,</b>

530
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:10,965
<b>I never thought I'd become who I am now.</b>

531
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:15,005
<b>Even as a child,
I was more comfortable away from home.</b>

532
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:19,845
<b>Once I decided to become a chef,</b>

533
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:23,485
<b>I rarely came home
and traveled all across the country.</b>

534
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:26,185
<b>That's when I met great people</b>

535
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,555
<b>like Mr. Song.</b>

536
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:33,055
<b>After learning to cook Korean cuisine,
I went abroad.</b>

537
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:38,165
<b>I wanted to make Korean food for people
who don't even know where Korea is.</b>

538
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:41,935
<b>But isn't it weird</b>

539
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:45,675
<b>that all that time away from home,</b>

540
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:49,475
<b>I never thought I was lonely,</b>

541
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:53,145
<b>because I knew that my parents are
always here</b>

542
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:55,275
<b>and that there is Pungcheonok.</b>

543
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:57,815
<b>I realized this only recently.</b>

544
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:02,555
<b>The reason I could do whatever I wanted is</b>

545
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,895
<b>because I knew</b>

546
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:10,365
<b>that I had a home to come back to.</b>

547
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:14,735
<b>What are you saying?</b>

548
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:19,005
<b>Everyone is talking</b>

549
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:24,175
<b>about how the genius designer Bella is
reborn as Yoo Yu-jin.</b>

550

<b>They're all waiting for her next show.</b>

551
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:32,415
<b>- Chef Moon, I...
- I thought about it,</b>

552

<b>and this is</b>

553
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:37,955
<b>the only thing I can do for you.</b>

554
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:46,935
<b>Yu-jin,</b>

555
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:51,265
<b>don't worry and just leave.</b>

556
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:54,135
<b>Do whatever you want,</b>

<b>make whatever clothes you'd like,</b>

<b>home.</b>

560

<b>The village people have prepared

00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,869
<b>Here are some dumplings too.</b>

620
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:53,039
<b>- Hey, there.
- This is some gochujang.</b>

621
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,969
<b>That's good.</b>

622
00:45:55,970 --> 00:45:58,769
<b>Koreans can't live without gochujang.</b>

623
00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:00,109
<b>That's right.</b>

624
00:46:00,110 --> 00:46:01,509
<b>Should we pack her some more, then?</b>

625
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:03,075
<b>So, this is the end.</b>

626
00:46:04,210 --> 00:46:07,075
<b>It won't be if you come back.</b>

627
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:09,245
<b>What's that?</b>

628
00:46:09,290 --> 00:46:10,885
<b>Were you planning on
never seeing us again?</b>

629
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,015
<b>I don't do that.</b>

630
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:16,855
<b>If it's the end, it's the end.
If it's not, it's not.</b>

631
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:20,195
<b>Let's not make a promise.</b>

632
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:22,155
<b>That way,</b>

633
00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:24,995
<b>we'll try our best.</b>

634
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:30,735
<b>I love you.</b>

635
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:32,535
<b>What?</b>

636
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,515
<b>I love you.</b>

637
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:48,755
<b>How can I leave with you saying that?</b>

638
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:52,055
<b>We can't have</b>

639
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:54,425
<b>either of us regretting anything.</b>

640
00:46:55,830 --> 00:46:57,595
<b>So, here I am, checking for the last time.</b>

641
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:34,095
<b>Me too.</b>

642
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:36,665
<b>Checking for one last time.</b>

643
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:41,275
<b>Goodbye.</b>

644
00:47:44,650 --> 00:47:46,145
<b>Goodbye, everyone.</b>

645
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,445
<b>- Yes.
- Of course.</b>

646
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:51,585
<b>Seol-a, you too.</b>

647
00:47:59,730 --> 00:48:01,095
<b>Bye, Seol-a.</b>

648
00:48:04,370 --> 00:48:05,625
<b>Bye now.</b>

649
00:48:05,770 --> 00:48:07,235
<b>Drive safe.</b>

650
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:08,639
<b>Bye.</b>

651
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:11,005
<b>- Bye now!
- Drive safe.</b>

652
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:31,429
<b>Hello!</b>

653
00:48:31,430 --> 00:48:34,259
<b>You're back from school!</b>

654
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:35,355
<b>Yes, I am.</b>

655
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,729
<b>I hear that the kitchen renovation
at Pungcheonok is all done.</b>

656
00:48:37,730 --> 00:48:38,799
<b>Yes.</b>

657
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,499
<b>All we need is the ssi-ganjang, then.</b>

658
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,709
<b>Let's start with the Hwangs.
I'll lead the way.</b>

659
00:48:42,710 --> 00:48:45,935
<b>Do you really think there's something
so precious as the ssi-ganjang</b>

660
00:48:46,110 --> 00:48:47,539
<b>in our village?</b>

661
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:49,335
<b>Exactly.</b>

662
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,349
<b>My heart was broken</b>

663
00:48:51,350 --> 00:48:52,849
<b>when all of our ssi-ganjang dried out</b>

664
00:48:52,850 --> 00:48:55,245
<b>from the kitchen fire at Pungcheonok.</b>

665
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:57,545
<b>That's why I'm going to try to look</b>

666
00:48:57,790 --> 00:48:59,555
<b>for our own ssi-ganjang in the village.</b>

667
00:48:59,790 --> 00:49:02,119
<b>That's meaningful, too.</b>

668
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:04,589
<b>Come on in first.
We have some old ganjang at home too.</b>

669
00:49:04,590 --> 00:49:06,099
<b>Come and give it a try.</b>

670
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:07,195
<b>Let's go.</b>

671
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:09,625
<b>May I give it a try?</b>

672
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:11,525
<b>Of course.</b>

673
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,235
<b>We don't even need to try it.</b>

674
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:16,535
<b>This isn't it.</b>

675
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:18,705
<b>But you still have to give it a try.</b>

676
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:20,005
<b>Here.</b>

677
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:21,609
<b>Chef Moon, here.</b>

678
00:49:21,610 --> 00:49:22,949
<b>Where's the next house?</b>

679
00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:24,305
<b>Ms. Byung-chun's house.</b>

680
00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:27,149
<b>Let's start over there
and make our way down.</b>

681
00:49:27,150 --> 00:49:28,515
<b>Sure.</b>

682
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:31,115
<b>- This is not it.
- That's too bad.</b>

683
00:49:33,290 --> 00:49:34,419
<b>Hello there.</b>

684
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:36,325
<b>You're here.</b>

685
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:39,355
<b>- What are you doing?
- Hey there.</b>

686
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:42,255
<b>I'm just getting my husband lessons.</b>

687
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:45,299
<b>What are you saying?</b>

688
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:47,665
<b>- You're looking for the ssi-ganjang?
- Yes.</b>

689
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:02,215
<b>Is this not it?</b>

690
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:06,189
<b>Come this way.</b>

691
00:50:06,190 --> 00:50:07,759
<b>This family has good ganjang too.</b>

692
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:09,155
<b>Hyuk's mom!</b>

693
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:15,629
<b>Well, in that case, right this way.</b>

694
00:50:15,630 --> 00:50:17,325
<b>Here.</b>

695
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:19,365
<b>Jang-su!</b>

696
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:20,869
<b>I'm here.</b>

697
00:50:20,870 --> 00:50:22,809
<b>Hello there.</b>

698
00:50:22,810 --> 00:50:24,869
<b>Thank you so much. Bye now!</b>

699
00:50:24,870 --> 00:50:26,179
<b>You can stay for longer.</b>

700
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:27,335
<b>This way.</b>

701
00:50:29,210 --> 00:50:30,945
<b>Bye now.</b>

702
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:32,549
<b>Goodness.</b>

703
00:50:32,550 --> 00:50:34,245
<b>Bye!</b>

704
00:50:34,550 --> 00:50:36,745
<b>This isn't it either?</b>

705
00:50:36,790 --> 00:50:38,945
<b>Yoon-ja's home is the only one left.</b>

706
00:50:39,290 --> 00:50:40,585
<b>Come on. Let's go.</b>

707
00:50:41,690 --> 00:50:42,825
<b>Let's go.</b>

708
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:45,685
<b>- Sure.
- When are we going to find it?</b>

709
00:50:45,730 --> 00:50:46,999
<b>Let's go.</b>

710
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,095
<b>It's that way.</b>

711
00:50:52,370 --> 00:50:53,899
<b>It smells good.</b>

712
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:54,999
<b>- What?
- What?</b>

713
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,269
<b>Dad, it smells very similar</b>

714
00:50:57,270 --> 00:50:58,969
<b>to the old ssi-ganjang.</b>

715
00:50:58,970 --> 00:51:00,135
<b>Really?</b>

716
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:23,695
<b>I think we've found it.</b>

717
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:27,895
<b>Really?</b>

718
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:31,009
<b>My grandmother made this ssi-ganjang,</b>

719
00:51:31,010 --> 00:51:33,775
<b>and I've just been adding more to it
when I run out.</b>

720
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:35,575
<b>Is this really good?</b>

721
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,405
<b>The secret behind your amazing food was</b>

722
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:39,349
<b>this ganjang all along?</b>

723
00:51:39,350 --> 00:51:40,915
<b>If you'd let me,</b>

724
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:43,315
<b>I'd like to use this
as Pungcheonok's ssi-ganjang.</b>

725
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:44,549
<b>Goodness!</b>

726
00:51:44,550 --> 00:51:47,115
<b>Pungcheonok belongs to all of us.</b>

727
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:50,589
<b>If we can re-open the restaurant
with this ssi-ganjang,</b>

728
00:51:50,590 --> 00:51:52,655
<b>I'd be more than happy to see that.</b>

729
00:51:52,690 --> 00:51:55,755
<b>Does that mean that we can open
Pungcheonok once again?</b>

730
00:51:57,570 --> 00:51:59,095
<b>- Awesome!
- Great!</b>

731
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,599
<b>We found it!</b>

732
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:03,469
<b>It was right here all along.</b>

733
00:52:03,470 --> 00:52:04,739
<b>What a surprise!</b>

734
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:07,775
<b>Let's all try some.</b>

735
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:23,025
<b>Yes, Jang Madam?</b>

736
00:52:32,010 --> 00:52:33,475
<b>Yes, Jang Madam?</b>

737
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:35,179
<b>I told you,</b>

738
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:37,045
<b>it's Madam Jang.</b>

739
00:52:37,150 --> 00:52:39,179
<b>Who says Jang Madam?</b>

740
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:40,979
<b>That doesn't sound respectable at all.</b>

741
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:42,945
<b>Jang Madam, Madam Jang, same thing.</b>

742
00:52:44,050 --> 00:52:46,019
<b>I'm busy designing some things. What's up?</b>

743
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:47,615
<b>Let's make this brief.</b>

744
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:51,685
<b>Why did you have to buy a winery
all the way in Australia?</b>

745
00:52:51,690 --> 00:52:53,795
<b>There are so many wineries in France too.</b>

746
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:55,929
<b>You used to give me such a hard time</b>

747
00:52:55,930 --> 00:52:58,799
<b>because you couldn't work anywhere else
other than at your studio,</b>

748
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,735
<b>[ but now, you're always there. ]</b>

749
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:02,865
<b>[ You're doing this on purpose,
aren't you? ]</b>

750
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:05,265
<b>This is so frustrating.</b>

751
00:53:05,570 --> 00:53:07,235
<b>Stop beating around the bush.</b>

752
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,105
<b>Why did you call?</b>

753
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:10,305
<b>What?</b>

754
00:53:10,410 --> 00:53:12,205
<b>Right.</b>

755
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:14,079
<b>When are you going to come back?</b>

756
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:15,619
<b>It takes over 24 hours</b>

757
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:17,519
<b>to get from the Gold Coast to Paris.</b>

758
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:18,889
<b>[ You should've prepared sooner! ]</b>

759
00:53:18,890 --> 00:53:20,815
<b>Stop nagging!</b>

760
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:22,915
<b>I'm not a kid.
I can take care of it on my own.</b>

761
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:24,285
<b>I'm sick of your nagging.</b>

762
00:53:24,530 --> 00:53:26,185
<b>You're sick of it, aren't you?</b>

763
00:53:26,230 --> 00:53:28,455
<b>I'm mortified by it.</b>

764
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:31,069
<b>Had I picked up a rock from the ground</b>

765
00:53:31,070 --> 00:53:33,029
<b>and gave it as much attention
as what I've given you,</b>

766
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:35,895
<b>the rock would've been flying in the air
by now.</b>

767
00:53:37,270 --> 00:53:38,535
<b>Fine.</b>

768
00:53:39,110 --> 00:53:40,635
<b>I'm going to start packing now.</b>

769
00:53:41,710 --> 00:53:42,805
<b>By the way,</b>

770
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:45,545
<b>how is the other rock doing?</b>

771
00:53:45,850 --> 00:53:46,945
<b>Is she good?</b>

772
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:52,345
<b>The other rock is quite a girl too.</b>

773
00:53:52,690 --> 00:53:54,389
<b>She struggled at first,</b>

774
00:53:54,390 --> 00:53:56,985
<b>but she's doing quite well now.</b>

775
00:53:57,060 --> 00:53:58,385
