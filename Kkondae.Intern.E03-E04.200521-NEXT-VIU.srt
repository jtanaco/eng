(Internship, Ssukussuku, June 2019 to December 2019)

5
00:00:17,968 --> 00:00:20,538
You did an internship at Ssukussuku.

6
00:00:20,538 --> 00:00:23,169
I see. Ssukussuku in Indonesia?

7
00:00:23,169 --> 00:00:27,139
Yes, I'm a guy who has had quite a lot of ramyeon in Indonesia.

8
00:00:27,139 --> 00:00:28,479
Indonesia is big on ramyeon,

9
00:00:28,479 --> 00:00:31,209
recording the second place in the world ramyeon consumption.

10
00:00:31,209 --> 00:00:33,878
They eat about 12.5 billion ramyeon in a year.

11
00:00:33,878 --> 00:00:37,988
And Ssukussuku dominates 70 percent of that huge industry.

12
00:00:37,988 --> 00:00:40,189
Okay. He's our guy.

Hello! I'm Lee Tae Lee.

16
00:00:54,698 --> 00:00:56,098
You're right.

17
00:00:56,098 --> 00:00:58,939
My name sounds like "Italy", Lee Tae Lee.

18
00:00:58,939 --> 00:01:02,109
But I haven't been there yet.

19
00:01:02,539 --> 00:01:04,179
Nice to meet you.

20
00:01:04,179 --> 00:01:05,909
Tae Lee, Tae Lee, Lee Tae Lee.

21
00:01:09,049 --> 00:01:11,648
What's with this awful introduction?

22
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:17,359
I see.

23
00:01:17,958 --> 00:01:19,758
- Ms. Lee? - Yes?

24
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:22,159
Why is your hair dyed in that color?

25
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,928
Don't you know what ombre hair is?

26
00:01:23,928 --> 00:01:26,029
This is the hottest style right now.

27
00:01:26,029 --> 00:01:28,699
I believe people who make food...

28
00:01:28,699 --> 00:01:30,738
should be sensitive about trends.

29
00:01:30,738 --> 00:01:34,678
Not only that, but we should also be the leaders who make trends.

30
00:01:34,809 --> 00:01:35,809
You fail.

31

I'm Joo Yoon Soo. Nice to meet you.

37
00:01:57,199 --> 00:01:59,798
Why does he sound like a goat?

38
00:02:00,699 --> 00:02:03,239
What do you think about our Spicy Chicken Ramyeon?

39
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:04,369
Well...

40
00:02:06,938 --> 00:02:09,209
May I be honest?

41
00:02:10,278 --> 00:02:11,278
Sure.

42
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:16,948
Why do people like something that's painfully spicy?

43
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:23,959
You fail.

I'm meeting him tonight.

50
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:54,619
How dare a company like Joonsu Food...

51
00:02:54,619 --> 00:02:57,559
call out a man who's with the great Ongol?

52
00:02:57,929 --> 00:02:58,989
How dare you?

53
00:03:01,128 --> 00:03:04,299
Goodness, Man Sic. You still got your game.

54
00:03:04,628 --> 00:03:06,769
You and your Ongol pride.

55
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:07,839
Drink up.

56
00:03:07,839 --> 00:03:10,068
People will get suspicious...

57
00:03:10,438 --> 00:03:12,739
if you and I sit around like this.

58
00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:15,538
They'll think we're in league or one of us is an industrial spy.

59
00:03:16,109 --> 00:03:18,079
Don't you know that people talk?

60
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:19,079
Hey.

61
00:03:19,609 --> 00:03:22,248
You said you quit. What are you so worried about?

62
00:03:23,218 --> 00:03:24,218
Drink up.

63
00:03:27,859 --> 00:03:28,919
So what is it?

64
00:03:34,728 --> 00:03:35,829
Man Sic.

65
00:03:36,728 --> 00:03:38,769
Do you want to work for our company?

66
00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:40,299
Darn it.

67
00:03:41,538 --> 00:03:42,538
What?

68
00:03:43,339 --> 00:03:45,068
Are you telling me to become a traitor?

69
00:03:45,068 --> 00:03:46,869
You're hardly a traitor.

70
00:03:47,008 --> 00:03:50,008
Your country abandoned you first.

71
00:03:50,649 --> 00:03:52,008
Once your country abandons you,

72
00:03:52,008 --> 00:03:53,778
you abandon your country too.

73
00:03:56,179 --> 00:03:58,688
So? Will you trust me...

74
00:03:59,248 --> 00:04:02,158
and get a fresh start in a new country?

75
00:04:07,399 --> 00:04:10,968
You know what? Joonsu Food copied everything we made!

76
00:04:10,968 --> 00:04:14,068
- Hey, man! - What? We didn't copy anything.

77
00:04:14,369 --> 00:04:18,969
You always say Joonsu Food copied everything you made!

78
00:04:18,969 --> 00:04:20,169
Hey!

79
00:04:20,679 --> 00:04:24,148
You jerk! If you're that good, why did you copy...

80
00:04:24,148 --> 00:04:26,279
King Jjambbong?

81
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:29,279
Hey, no matter how much you people try to copy it,

82
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:31,818
you can't recreate that flavor.

83
00:04:31,818 --> 00:04:36,588
This is... This is why people like the original stuff better.

84
00:04:36,588 --> 00:04:38,529
- Do you know what that means? - Hey, you jerk.

85
00:04:38,529 --> 00:04:40,698
We didn't copy anything, you jerk.

86
00:04:40,698 --> 00:04:41,828
Listen to this guy.

87
00:04:41,828 --> 00:04:46,198
Hey, everyone in this industry can think of jjambbong ramyeon.

88
00:04:46,498 --> 00:04:49,239
Is that why you copied ours?

89
00:04:49,239 --> 00:04:51,068
- What? - You copied Jjapaguri...

90
00:04:51,068 --> 00:04:53,109
and made Dripping Chunjang.

91
00:04:53,109 --> 00:04:56,138
You jerk. Are you all finished?

92
00:04:56,138 --> 00:04:58,609
Yes, so what? I'm all done.

93
00:04:58,748 --> 00:05:01,919
You make something ridiculous like Dripping Chunjang.

94
00:05:02,318 --> 00:05:05,888
How dare you stand up against this Lee Man Sic?

95
00:05:06,388 --> 00:05:09,559
I wouldn't work there even if I was a board member!

96
00:05:09,818 --> 00:05:11,989
What? An internship?

97
00:05:12,559 --> 00:05:13,628
An internship?

98
00:05:15,198 --> 00:05:16,659
Go play badminton, you jerk.

99
00:05:16,659 --> 00:05:17,698
Intern, badminton?

100
00:05:18,969 --> 00:05:20,469
Internship, my foot.

101
00:05:20,469 --> 00:05:23,469
Hey, that's my jacket, you thief!

102
00:05:24,469 --> 00:05:25,708
What's with you?

103
00:05:26,109 --> 00:05:29,208
This guy copied every single product we made.

104
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:32,148
This guy got fired from Ongol.

105
00:05:32,148 --> 00:05:34,179
Hey, man. Come here.

106
00:05:45,828 --> 00:05:47,458
It's not just an internship.

107
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,429
It's a pre-employment internship.

108
00:05:49,429 --> 00:05:51,198
Call me if you change your mind.

109
00:06:09,148 --> 00:06:11,148
How long have you been working here?

110
00:06:12,719 --> 00:06:14,789
About three years now.

111
00:06:15,619 --> 00:06:16,818
Over the last three years,

112
00:06:17,018 --> 00:06:20,088
did you ever think that you work for...

113
00:06:20,628 --> 00:06:21,929
such a great company?

114
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:26,869
No, I often thought that I work for...

115
00:06:26,869 --> 00:06:29,099
such an awful company.

116
00:06:32,138 --> 00:06:33,739
Back when I worked for my old company,

117
00:06:34,578 --> 00:06:36,378
it'd get steaming hot outside,

118
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:40,409
but I'd sit in my office with the air conditioner blowing on max.

119
00:06:40,948 --> 00:06:45,248
That was one time when I had a thought...

120
00:06:46,219 --> 00:06:47,789
I work for a great company.

121
00:06:47,789 --> 00:06:50,789
You should forget those days as soon as possible.

122
00:06:51,489 --> 00:06:54,099
How can someone park here?

123
00:06:54,099 --> 00:06:55,958
Where is he? Where are the guards?

124
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:57,529
- Guards! - Darn it.

125
00:06:57,529 --> 00:06:58,568
- Guards! - We should go.

126
00:06:58,568 --> 00:06:59,799
You don't see him, do you?

127
00:06:59,799 --> 00:07:03,268
See? I'm working for such an awful company.

128
00:07:03,268 --> 00:07:06,169
- Guards! - We're running late.

129
00:07:06,169 --> 00:07:07,638
- My gosh. - Goodness.

130

(Joonsu Food)

131
00:07:16,518 --> 00:07:19,018
Hey, what is this?

132
00:07:19,018 --> 00:07:20,688
Are you sure you persuaded him?

133
00:07:22,188 --> 00:07:23,989
Gosh, it's...

134
00:07:25,828 --> 00:07:29,229
We did get into a bit of a quarrel.

135
00:07:31,469 --> 00:07:32,469
Hey.

136
00:07:33,969 --> 00:07:35,099
- You're late. - I'm sorry.

137
00:07:38,109 --> 00:07:39,268
Mr. Lee Man Sic.

138
00:07:39,508 --> 00:07:40,508
Yes, sir.

139

(Marketing and Sales Department)

140
00:07:56,719 --> 00:07:57,828
Hello!

141
00:07:58,828 --> 00:08:00,388
I'm the senior intern...

142
00:08:00,388 --> 00:08:03,029
who'll begin as of today, Lee Man Sic.

143
00:08:15,878 --> 00:08:17,979
Why are you here, Mr. Lee?

144
00:08:19,008 --> 00:08:20,008
Who are you?

145
00:08:22,119 --> 00:08:23,518
Do you know me?

146
00:08:29,818 --> 00:08:30,818
You're...

147
00:08:32,029 --> 00:08:33,129
You're...

148
00:08:42,968 --> 00:08:47,169
- I can work somewhere else. - Man Sic, don't go anywhere.

149
00:08:47,169 --> 00:08:49,509
- Let me go! - My goodness, man.

150
00:08:49,509 --> 00:08:51,409
Hey! Come on.

151
00:08:51,848 --> 00:08:55,118
Do you expect me to work for that kid?

152
00:08:55,249 --> 00:08:58,419
Is that why you asked me so much about Ga Yeol Chan?

153
00:08:59,019 --> 00:09:00,958
What kind of nonsense is this?

154
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:03,759
Hey. Calm down, okay?

155
00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:05,259
- Okay? - Darn it.

156
00:09:06,259 --> 00:09:07,389
Do you know him?

157
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:11,169
Who is this man...

158
00:09:11,169 --> 00:09:14,539
that you want to pressure the human resources...

159
00:09:14,539 --> 00:09:17,039
without staying within your boundaries?

160
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:19,139
- It's not like that... - I know it's you,

161
00:09:19,139 --> 00:09:20,669
but you can't do that.

162
00:09:25,448 --> 00:09:29,348
I was complimented for once by our chairman...

163
00:09:29,348 --> 00:09:31,249
after I suggested we implement a senior internship.

164
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:36,358
So it doesn't matter even if this is you.

165
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,559
I can't call this off.

166
00:09:41,228 --> 00:09:44,159
Then I'll have to understand.

167
00:09:46,868 --> 00:09:48,868
You shouldn't be focused on saving face.

168
00:09:50,438 --> 00:09:52,838
I heard you spent all your severance pay...

169
00:09:52,838 --> 00:09:54,879
on your ill parent.

170
00:09:56,509 --> 00:10:00,179
You won't be an intern forever.

171
00:10:01,448 --> 00:10:02,948
You know that our company has a high percentage...

172
00:10:02,948 --> 00:10:04,488
of turning contract workers into full-time employees.

173
00:10:08,618 --> 00:10:11,629
I work directly under the CEO.

174
00:10:12,328 --> 00:10:13,559
I'll help you.

175
00:10:15,098 --> 00:10:16,129
Why?

176
00:10:17,629 --> 00:10:19,468
Why are you doing this?

177
00:10:20,299 --> 00:10:21,399
Because I'm afraid.

178
00:10:24,368 --> 00:10:28,478
As long as he's here, I won't be able to get a promotion.

179
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:34,718
Let's oust Yeol Chan and climb up the ladder together.

180
00:10:35,149 --> 00:10:36,718
What do you say, Man Sic?

181
00:10:39,688 --> 00:10:42,088
Hey, is he that powerful?

182
00:10:42,858 --> 00:10:45,088
I don't know what he did,

183
00:10:45,088 --> 00:10:46,529
but the chairman dotes on him.

184
00:10:46,529 --> 00:10:48,529
Rumors say that not only did he give him a house and a car,

185
00:10:48,529 --> 00:10:50,399
but also some of his stocks.

186
00:10:51,929 --> 00:10:53,999
How did he become so successful?

187
00:10:59,169 --> 00:11:01,639
The CEO would like to see you soon.

188
00:11:13,718 --> 00:11:15,019
You haven't quit your job?

189
00:11:15,019 --> 00:11:17,789
How dare you join us? How dare you?

190
00:11:17,789 --> 00:11:19,659
Hey, get rid of that thing.

191
00:11:20,828 --> 00:11:22,999
That useless idiot. Why did you call him here?

192
00:11:23,529 --> 00:11:24,669
Who called him?

193
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:28,198
Hey, did you call him? Why would you?

194
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:42,818
What year were you guys born in?

195
00:11:44,448 --> 00:11:46,149
I was born in 1993.

196
00:11:46,149 --> 00:11:47,249
I was born in 1992.

197
00:11:47,249 --> 00:11:48,289
I see.

198
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:51,188
Since you guys are younger than me, I'll speak casually.

199
00:11:51,629 --> 00:11:53,129
- Okay. - Okay.

200
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,629
I'm not trying to intimidate you.

201
00:11:54,629 --> 00:11:56,929
It's just more convenient when teaching things to my juniors.

202
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:59,529
By the way, what year were you born in?

203
00:11:59,629 --> 00:12:01,338
Why would you ask that?

204
00:12:01,868 --> 00:12:02,938
I was born in 1992.

205
00:12:02,938 --> 00:12:05,269
- Sorry? - What?

206
00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:08,279
I was born near the beginning of 1992.

207
00:12:09,738 --> 00:12:11,179
He was born in 1992?

208
00:12:13,779 --> 00:12:16,919
By the way, may I ask you your age?

209
00:12:19,419 --> 00:12:22,618
People live up to 100 years these days. I'm still young.

210
00:12:22,618 --> 00:12:23,818
You don't have to be so formal with me.

211
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:25,559
Just call me sir.

212
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:27,659
Right.

213
00:12:28,598 --> 00:12:31,968
How should I address you?

214
00:12:32,328 --> 00:12:34,269
How should we address you?

215
00:12:34,269 --> 00:12:36,639
Intern Lee? Sir?

216
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:37,669
Mr. Lee Man Sic.

217
00:12:41,438 --> 00:12:44,309
That's his name. How else should we call him?

218
00:12:49,218 --> 00:12:52,889
You're right. It's his name, all right.

219
00:12:52,889 --> 00:12:55,019
But why do I feel so uncomfortable?

220
00:12:55,218 --> 00:12:56,458
Goodness.

221
00:12:56,659 --> 00:12:59,488
I'll only feel uncomfortable if you think that way.

222
00:12:59,488 --> 00:13:02,499
Please treat me the same way you'd treat them.

223
00:13:02,499 --> 00:13:05,568
This is my motto. "Be an adult, not a kkondae."

224
00:13:05,568 --> 00:13:07,399
You're not old-fashioned at all.

225
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:11,208
I really enjoyed that movie starring Robert Downey, Jr.

226
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:12,738
- That's Robert De Niro. - By the way,

227
00:13:12,738 --> 00:13:15,438
how do you and Mr. Ga know each other?

228
00:13:21,249 --> 00:13:22,348
Us?

229
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:30,389
He said I looked exactly like someone he knew.

230
00:13:37,429 --> 00:13:39,198
(Ga Yeol Chan)

231
00:13:40,299 --> 00:13:41,999
I need to speak with you on the rooftop.

232
00:13:56,478 --> 00:13:59,149
It's you, right, Yeol Chan?

233
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:04,419
You've changed so much.

234
00:14:04,688 --> 00:14:06,688
I wouldn't have recognized you while passing by.

235
00:14:07,588 --> 00:14:08,799
By the way,

236
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:12,368
shouldn't I take some credit for your Spicy Chicken Ramyeon?

237
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:15,568
It's obvious that you got that from my Fiery Squid Ramyeon.

238
00:14:17,838 --> 00:14:19,509
You haven't changed one bit.

239
00:14:20,608 --> 00:14:21,639
Is that so?

240
00:14:23,539 --> 00:14:25,509
How are you here as a senior intern?

241
00:14:25,779 --> 00:14:30,078
Well, after retiring, I wasn't happy with my life.

242
00:14:30,478 --> 00:14:31,519
Why did you leave Ongol?

243
00:14:32,889 --> 00:14:34,659
I decided to quit.

244
00:14:35,188 --> 00:14:38,958
Because of me, those below me couldn't get promoted.

245
00:14:39,728 --> 00:14:40,929
You know what I mean.

246
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:44,669
I didn't know you cared so much for your juniors.

247
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:51,468
Then why did you treat me that way?

248
00:14:53,608 --> 00:14:54,779
Gosh.

249
00:14:55,879 --> 00:14:57,809
Are you still upset about that?

250
00:15:02,618 --> 00:15:03,649
I just don't get it.

251
00:15:03,818 --> 00:15:06,848
You could've opened up a small store with your severance pay.

252
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:10,118
Or you could've joined some other company.

253
00:15:10,358 --> 00:15:12,358
Do you think you can work under me?

254
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:15,728
Why not?

255
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:17,559
I'm completely fine.

256
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:23,169
Is that so?

257
00:15:23,299 --> 00:15:24,338
Sure thing.

258
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:27,269
Then try holding out.

259
00:15:29,539 --> 00:15:30,578
All right.

260
00:15:34,149 --> 00:15:36,379
I'd like to make one more thing clear.

261
00:15:38,318 --> 00:15:39,448
You and I...

262
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:43,919
Mr. Lee, you and I...

263
00:15:44,789 --> 00:15:46,088
have never met before.

264
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:48,899
Do you understand?

265
00:15:50,029 --> 00:15:51,029
Sure.

266
00:15:51,029 --> 00:15:53,098
I'm your superior. Where are your manners?

267
00:15:54,968 --> 00:15:55,999
Yes, sir.

268
00:16:04,978 --> 00:16:06,249
Also, "senior intern"?

269
00:16:07,249 --> 00:16:08,448
I don't care about that.

270
00:16:09,618 --> 00:16:10,749
Don't expect...

271
00:16:11,389 --> 00:16:12,389
to be treated well...

272
00:16:14,049 --> 00:16:15,419
just because you're old.

273
00:16:18,828 --> 00:16:19,828
Yes, sir.

274
00:16:33,938 --> 00:16:36,679
He's completely changed.

275
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:15,019
Cheer up.

276
00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:20,449
(Analysis of Joonsu's Products)

277
00:17:20,989 --> 00:17:25,259
Mr. Ga, I've personally analyzed our products.

278
00:17:25,259 --> 00:17:26,759
- You did? - Yes, sir.

279
00:17:32,368 --> 00:17:33,999
(Analysis of Joonsu's Products)

280
00:17:39,009 --> 00:17:40,108
300 pages?

281
00:17:43,078 --> 00:17:47,209
How could he attach these to all 300 pages?

282
00:17:51,689 --> 00:17:53,888
Why did he highlight everything?

283
00:18:00,358 --> 00:18:04,029
I'll take my time to read through this.

284
00:18:05,299 --> 00:18:06,328
Yes, sir.

285
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:08,838
Thank you, sir.

286
00:18:18,878 --> 00:18:20,578
Ms. Lee, are you eating something?

287
00:18:21,678 --> 00:18:22,719
No, sir.

288
00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:29,259
- Can you give that to me? - Okay.

289
00:18:29,259 --> 00:18:30,789
Please do that.

290
00:18:31,019 --> 00:18:33,888
Okay, please make it quick. Thank you.

291
00:18:34,689 --> 00:18:35,759
- Mr. Oh. - Yes?

292
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:37,059
About what I told you yesterday...

293
00:18:37,259 --> 00:18:38,769
A group of idiots...

294
00:18:39,469 --> 00:18:40,598
joined my team.

295
00:18:40,598 --> 00:18:42,838
Thank you, Ms. Tak.

296
00:18:43,668 --> 00:18:44,668
Attention, please.

297
00:18:45,809 --> 00:18:47,539
Shall we gather in the meeting room?

298
00:18:47,539 --> 00:18:49,078
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

299
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:52,779
We have new family members.

300
00:18:53,449 --> 00:18:54,479
I'd like to welcome our interns,

301
00:18:55,348 --> 00:18:57,878
Mr. Joo Yoon Soo, Ms. Lee Tae Lee,

302
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:00,648
and Mr. Lee Man Sic.

303
00:19:03,219 --> 00:19:05,088
This is the Marketing and Sales Department, and I'm...

304
00:19:05,428 --> 00:19:06,828
The leader!

305
00:19:06,828 --> 00:19:09,959
Yes, I'm the leader. My name is Ga Yeol Chan.

306
00:19:10,059 --> 00:19:11,628
- Clap. - Clap.

307
00:19:11,628 --> 00:19:13,499
(Marketing and Sales Department)

308
00:19:14,199 --> 00:19:15,199
Okay.

309
00:19:16,838 --> 00:19:18,269
Let's cut to the chase.

310
00:19:18,668 --> 00:19:22,138
I'll brief you guys on what you'll be doing.

311
00:19:22,838 --> 00:19:25,979
Many people think interns only do trivial tasks.

312
00:19:26,378 --> 00:19:27,408
That's right.

313
00:19:27,408 --> 00:19:30,249
To be frank, that's the basis and the main job of an intern.

314
00:19:31,178 --> 00:19:32,949
Someone needs to do that.

315
00:19:33,588 --> 00:19:36,259
Mr. Lee, you're not an exception.

316
00:19:38,388 --> 00:19:39,989
However,

317
00:19:40,928 --> 00:19:43,898
giving only menial tasks to you guys...

318
00:19:43,898 --> 00:19:46,769
is a loss to the company and a waste of our resources.

319
00:19:47,299 --> 00:19:50,098
So you will be able to participate in real projects as well.

320
00:19:52,509 --> 00:19:54,939
Your attitude, projects, and performance will be...

321
00:19:54,939 --> 00:19:57,338
reflected on your evaluation for the full-time positions. Okay?

322
00:19:57,338 --> 00:19:58,378
- Okay. - Okay.

323
00:19:58,378 --> 00:20:00,178
Up until now, the assistant manager, Mr. Oh Dong Geun,

324
00:20:00,178 --> 00:20:02,678
was in charge of supervising the interns.

325
00:20:02,678 --> 00:20:05,219
But as there are three interns in this quarter,

326
00:20:05,219 --> 00:20:07,489
we will divide the roles again.

327
00:20:08,049 --> 00:20:10,719
In order to help the interns participate in our projects...

328
00:20:10,719 --> 00:20:11,928
as soon as possible,

329
00:20:11,928 --> 00:20:13,459
we will proceed...

330
00:20:13,459 --> 00:20:16,529
with a mentor-mentee program where each intern will get a mentor.

331
00:20:17,059 --> 00:20:19,568
I will now announce each mentee's mentor...

332
00:20:19,568 --> 00:20:21,668
who will partner up with them and work as their supervisor.

333
00:20:23,699 --> 00:20:25,838
- Mr. Joo Yoon Soo is with... - I hope we can work well together.

334
00:20:25,838 --> 00:20:27,269
- Mr. Oh Dong Geun. - Same here.

335
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:29,408
- Ms. Lee Tae Lee is with... - I hope we can work well together.

336
00:20:29,408 --> 00:20:30,779
Ms. Tak Jung Eun.

337
00:20:32,178 --> 00:20:34,479
And lastly, Mr. Lee Man Sic is with...

338
00:20:39,088 --> 00:20:40,088
me.

339
00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:47,059
Mr. Kim Seung Jin, try to help them out as much as you can.

340
00:20:47,059 --> 00:20:48,059
Yes, sir.

341
00:20:48,189 --> 00:20:51,799
As Mr. Kim was an intern like yourselves only a year ago,

342
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:54,328
you should try to get tips on how to become a full-time position.

343
00:20:54,568 --> 00:20:55,568
- Okay. - Okay.

344
00:20:55,568 --> 00:20:57,668
My gosh. I hope we can work well together.

345
00:21:08,578 --> 00:21:11,279
First of all, Mr. Oh talks too much.

346
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:13,388
Whenever he talks, it just ends up ruining his image. You know?

347
00:21:13,388 --> 00:21:16,418
He speaks thoughtlessly once a day. And he's a cheapskate too.

348
00:21:16,418 --> 00:21:19,328
He likes to use everyone else's stuff as if it's his.

349
00:21:19,328 --> 00:21:20,959
But he catches on really fast.

350
00:21:20,959 --> 00:21:22,199
So keep a straight face.

351
00:21:22,199 --> 00:21:23,199
Okay.

352
00:21:23,499 --> 00:21:26,428
After returning from his paternity leave, he became so cheap.

353
00:21:28,898 --> 00:21:30,969
What are you doing? Are you taking care of your health alone again?

354
00:21:30,969 --> 00:21:32,668
I'm just using eye drops because my eyes are dry.

355
00:21:32,668 --> 00:21:35,378
Hey, Yoon Soo. You got a haircut because it's your first day of work.

356
00:21:35,378 --> 00:21:37,378
- Yes, I did. - Where did you get it?

357
00:21:37,378 --> 00:21:39,148
Are you planning to go there?

358
00:21:39,148 --> 00:21:40,779
My gosh, you think I'm crazy?

359
00:21:40,779 --> 00:21:43,219
I was just wondering where you got that ridiculous haircut from.

360
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:46,118
You need to trim your bangs, right? You look stuffy.

361
00:21:46,118 --> 00:21:48,459
It looks like you'll keep having a frustrating life. Okay.

362
00:21:48,459 --> 00:21:51,559
Right. If he acts all friendly and is nice to you,

363
00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:53,229
he's trying to give you his work.

364
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:55,598
- So be careful. - Your haircut looks great. Okay?

365
00:21:56,158 --> 00:21:57,158
Yoon Soo.

366
00:21:57,628 --> 00:21:59,868
Do you want to analyze on the dry noodles?

367
00:21:59,868 --> 00:22:01,269
I can do it myself,

368
00:22:01,668 --> 00:22:03,299
but I thought you'd be good at it.

369
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:05,709
I don't ask anyone to do this, you know.

370
00:22:07,739 --> 00:22:09,039
- Is that so? - Yes.

371
00:22:10,279 --> 00:22:11,309
Let's give it a try.

372
00:22:11,309 --> 00:22:12,878
All right. As for Ms. Tak,

373
00:22:12,878 --> 00:22:15,848
she's a contract worker which is rare at our company...

374
00:22:15,848 --> 00:22:18,789
since 95 percent of our employees have permanent positions.

375
00:22:18,789 --> 00:22:20,719
And it's her fifth year here.

376
00:22:20,719 --> 00:22:22,158
Can you guess what kind of person she is?

377
00:22:22,588 --> 00:22:23,588
Yes.

378
00:22:25,828 --> 00:22:27,229
(Restroom, Lee Tae Lee)

379
00:22:27,229 --> 00:22:29,128
She thinks interns and other contract workers...

380
00:22:29,128 --> 00:22:31,059
are her competition.

381
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:33,828
She doesn't befriend anyone, so don't be offended by that.

382
00:22:33,898 --> 00:22:35,838
Right. And she won't give you proper projects.

383
00:22:35,838 --> 00:22:39,068
Why? Because projects will lead to your performance.

384
00:22:43,939 --> 00:22:45,449
I'm the queen of the copy machine.

385
00:22:46,309 --> 00:22:49,479
No matter how menial a task is, if I work hard, I'll have a chance.

386
00:22:55,888 --> 00:22:57,759
But it looks like...

387
00:22:58,459 --> 00:23:01,128
all I'll be doing is copying documents.

388
00:23:01,628 --> 00:23:03,128
This is the office pantry.

389
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:05,868
You don't have to worry about Mr. Ga at all.

390
00:23:05,868 --> 00:23:07,969
He's the best boss ever.

391
00:23:08,299 --> 00:23:10,969
He's such an angel.

392
00:23:12,068 --> 00:23:14,168
Is that so?

393
00:23:14,168 --> 00:23:16,279
Yes. This is the coffee machine.

394
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:18,239
You can just press the button for Americano.

395
00:23:18,239 --> 00:23:19,309
What's the order?

396
00:23:19,678 --> 00:23:21,178
- Mr. Ga. - Next.

397
00:23:22,078 --> 00:23:23,178
- And who's next? - No.

398
00:23:23,178 --> 00:23:25,049
- It's you, Mr. Oh. - Okay.

399
00:23:25,049 --> 00:23:28,088
- And next? - And there are employees.

400
00:23:28,088 --> 00:23:30,158
- Right. They are mere employees. - Yes.

401
00:23:30,618 --> 00:23:31,959
You're very good.

402
00:23:32,259 --> 00:23:35,598
You have already understood the dynamic of our office.

403
00:23:35,598 --> 00:23:37,229
That's great.

404
00:23:37,699 --> 00:23:38,699
Mr. Ga.

405
00:23:39,568 --> 00:23:40,828
What should I do?

406
00:23:48,108 --> 00:23:49,908
Don't do anything.

407
00:23:50,709 --> 00:23:51,979
Don't do anything.

408
00:23:57,178 --> 00:23:58,588
It's your first day here.

409
00:23:58,588 --> 00:24:01,118
Rest up. And try to observe the tasks...

410
00:24:01,118 --> 00:24:02,759
other employees are on.

411
00:24:04,019 --> 00:24:05,259
I see.

412
00:24:09,658 --> 00:24:11,529
Should I learn about their tasks?

413
00:24:12,398 --> 00:24:13,628
On my own?

414
00:24:15,469 --> 00:24:16,469
Yes.

415
00:24:16,739 --> 00:24:18,568
- Well, we need to make a profit. - But the date...

416
00:24:18,568 --> 00:24:20,668
- I don't think it will work. - Okay.

417
00:24:20,668 --> 00:24:23,338
- Can you wait until the first? - Okay.

418
00:24:23,338 --> 00:24:25,779
- Okay. I see. Now... - Give me that.

419
00:24:25,779 --> 00:24:27,209
Hold on.

420
00:24:28,479 --> 00:24:30,519
Wait. I'll call you right back.

421
00:24:30,749 --> 00:24:32,118
Yes, sir.

422
00:25:27,868 --> 00:25:29,638
(Get ready to turn off the computer.)

423
00:25:30,638 --> 00:25:32,078
All right. It's over.

424
00:25:32,709 --> 00:25:34,309
- How nice. - Good work.

425
00:25:34,309 --> 00:25:36,148
- Good work. - Good work, everyone.

426
00:25:36,148 --> 00:25:37,678
All right. Good job today.

427
00:25:50,158 --> 00:25:51,158
What's this?

428
00:25:51,158 --> 00:25:52,598
I analyzed the pros and cons...

429
00:25:52,598 --> 00:25:56,539
of our products and wrote how we can improve our products.

430
00:25:58,739 --> 00:26:00,039
(Chapter 6: Conclusion)

431
00:26:00,039 --> 00:26:01,739
(Chapter 1: Introduction)

432
00:26:04,309 --> 00:26:05,779
Did you write this yourself?

433
00:26:05,979 --> 00:26:09,719
My gosh. You've been working in this industry for 30 years.

434
00:26:09,719 --> 00:26:11,019
I can tell you're experienced.

435
00:26:11,878 --> 00:26:12,888
You are indeed.

436
00:26:14,989 --> 00:26:16,059
Indeed.

437
00:26:37,678 --> 00:26:38,779
It's awful.

438
00:26:39,608 --> 00:26:41,108
I can't use any of it.

439
00:26:42,719 --> 00:26:43,719
Right.

440
00:27:01,928 --> 00:27:03,269
Mr. Ga is back.

441
00:27:03,969 --> 00:27:04,999
All right.

442
00:27:05,908 --> 00:27:06,969
Let's call it a day.

443
00:27:07,469 --> 00:27:10,709
You said we're having a company dinner with the interns today.

444
00:27:10,908 --> 00:27:13,279
I'm sorry. I got a last-minute meeting.

445
00:27:13,648 --> 00:27:14,809
Let's have it some other time.

446
00:27:15,318 --> 00:27:16,318
Okay.

447
00:27:17,118 --> 00:27:18,118
My gosh.

448
00:27:19,648 --> 00:27:22,059
Number one, laugh.

449
00:27:22,459 --> 00:27:24,189
Number two, laugh louder.

450
00:27:24,588 --> 00:27:26,628
Number three, laugh really loud.

451
00:27:27,289 --> 00:27:30,959
- All right. I'm on my way home. - Bring us snacks!

452
00:27:30,959 --> 00:27:32,029
My gosh.

453
00:27:34,229 --> 00:27:36,138
Didn't Mr. Ga seem a bit off today?

454
00:27:37,098 --> 00:27:38,939
What about Mr. Ga?

455
00:27:39,509 --> 00:27:42,739
Think about it. He said he'd be a mentor to the senior intern.

456
00:27:42,739 --> 00:27:45,378
But he didn't talk to the intern at all.

457
00:27:45,949 --> 00:27:47,049
That's not true.

458
00:27:47,049 --> 00:27:48,918
He read the intern's analysis of our products.

459
00:27:48,918 --> 00:27:51,418
Mr. Ga complimented on it. He was really considerate.

460
00:27:51,418 --> 00:27:52,789
- Exactly, my point. - Right.

461
00:27:53,019 --> 00:27:54,019
Really?

462
00:27:54,348 --> 00:27:55,689
I didn't know.

463
00:27:56,888 --> 00:27:59,059
Why did they hire someone like him?

464
00:27:59,059 --> 00:28:00,689
How can I order around an intern as old as him?

465
00:28:00,689 --> 00:28:02,699
His presence is making me feel very uncomfortable.

466
00:28:13,809 --> 00:28:16,509
Do you want to get drinks? Just us, the interns?

467
00:28:16,509 --> 00:28:18,509
- Why? - It's our first day at work,

468
00:28:18,509 --> 00:28:19,809
so I don't want to go home yet.

469
00:28:21,549 --> 00:28:22,818
Mr. Lee, do you want to come...

470
00:28:32,828 --> 00:28:33,828
Should we clink our glasses?

471
00:28:35,229 --> 00:28:36,229
Cheers.

472
00:28:39,799 --> 00:28:42,838
I'll have only one glass and go home after I finish.

473
00:28:42,838 --> 00:28:45,969
I came with you because it seemed you desperately wanted to drink.

474
00:28:46,739 --> 00:28:49,979
If we drink beer together, people might talk behind our backs.

475
00:28:50,138 --> 00:28:51,138
What?

476
00:28:51,809 --> 00:28:53,309
Let me explain.

477
00:28:53,309 --> 00:28:55,309
If we were having a get-together,

478
00:28:55,309 --> 00:28:58,118
we should have invited Mr. Lee too. I was wondering why you didn't.

479
00:28:58,118 --> 00:29:00,388
I just thought you might have an ulterior motive.

480
00:29:00,388 --> 00:29:01,648
It's not that, you know.

481
00:29:02,189 --> 00:29:04,888
If he joins us, it will be just uncomfortable.

482
00:29:05,628 --> 00:29:09,029
Besides, I saw that you two were talking earlier.

483
00:29:09,029 --> 00:29:11,098
And he kept asking personal questions.

484
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:14,898
He did. It's a good thing you didn't invite him.

485
00:29:14,898 --> 00:29:17,939
I don't know why he's so interested in my father's job.

486
00:29:18,769 --> 00:29:21,969
By the way, when they get new interns,

487
00:29:21,969 --> 00:29:24,479
are they supposed to treat us as if we're nobodies?

488
00:29:24,479 --> 00:29:26,848
And is it normal for them to skip our welcoming party?

489
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:29,848
Well, other companies don't throw us a grand welcoming party.

490
00:29:30,118 --> 00:29:32,049
Why? Did you expect a party?

491
00:29:32,549 --> 00:29:34,588
- Yes. - That's interesting.

492
00:29:34,588 --> 00:29:36,388
I guess some people look forward to those parties.

493
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:38,588
That kind of an occasion is more uncomfortable for me.

494
00:29:38,588 --> 00:29:39,858
It makes me feel uncomfortable too.

495
00:29:40,858 --> 00:29:41,959
Then why...

496
00:29:41,959 --> 00:29:44,098
I wanted to eat meat.

497
00:29:44,828 --> 00:29:45,868
Meat?

498
00:29:45,868 --> 00:29:47,529
I wanted beef.

499
00:29:49,969 --> 00:29:52,439
And it's my first time...

500
00:29:52,568 --> 00:29:54,739
working for such a big-name company.

501
00:29:55,239 --> 00:29:57,578
I think there are things that are meant to happen.

502
00:29:57,739 --> 00:29:59,878
I kind of expected to make it this time.

503
00:29:59,878 --> 00:30:03,678
It seemed like Mr. Ga had a connection with me.

504
00:30:03,848 --> 00:30:07,818
Of course. He seemed very open just as I have heard.

505
00:30:08,648 --> 00:30:11,559
I regretted having said something bad about Spicy Chicken Ramyeon,

506
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:13,959
but I think that captured his heart.

507
00:30:14,789 --> 00:30:17,658
So I plan to continue...

508
00:30:17,658 --> 00:30:21,328
to share my honest opinion with Mr. Ga.

509
00:30:21,799 --> 00:30:22,799
Sounds great.

510
00:30:23,368 --> 00:30:24,368
Cheers.

511
00:30:32,178 --> 00:30:33,949
I'll update it right now and re-print this.

512
00:30:33,949 --> 00:30:36,449
Just stay still! Don't do anything!

513
00:30:36,449 --> 00:30:38,118
Don't do anything from now on, okay?

514
00:30:38,178 --> 00:30:40,549
Mr. Ga? What should I do?

515
00:30:40,549 --> 00:30:42,219
Don't do anything.

516
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:43,689
Don't do anything.

517
00:30:46,259 --> 00:30:48,828
It's awful. I can't use any of it.

518
00:30:50,358 --> 00:30:53,499
Is that all you got? Repeating everything that I did?

519
00:30:54,199 --> 00:30:57,098
You're no match for me.

520
00:30:58,269 --> 00:31:00,638
- Thank you for dinner! - Thank you!

521
00:31:00,638 --> 00:31:01,969
Let's go for another drink!

522
00:31:01,969 --> 00:31:03,739
- Round 2! Round 2! - Round 2! Round 2!

523
00:31:03,739 --> 00:31:05,709
- Round 2! Round 2! - Okay, let's go!

524
00:31:05,709 --> 00:31:08,049
- All right! - Let's go for round two!

525
00:31:18,118 --> 00:31:20,059
Our son just became first place in school.

526
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:25,328
Does he want to eat anything?

528
00:31:32,539 --> 00:31:33,568
My son!

529
00:31:34,668 --> 00:31:36,439
I'm so proud of you.

530
00:31:36,578 --> 00:31:37,608
Sure.

531
00:31:37,678 --> 00:31:39,749
I heard our family will have a doctor one day.

532
00:31:39,749 --> 00:31:42,279
I knew it would be you, Man Sae.

533
00:31:42,378 --> 00:31:45,648
My son! Make sure you get into Seoul National University.

534
00:31:46,618 --> 00:31:48,289
It's a national university, so it's much cheaper.

535
00:31:48,289 --> 00:31:52,059
Life would be wonderful if it's always like this.

536
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:55,898
My husband just got a job as a director,

537
00:31:56,098 --> 00:31:59,668
and my son just became first place in school.

538
00:32:01,199 --> 00:32:03,068
I couldn't believe my luck,

539
00:32:03,068 --> 00:32:04,868
so I suddenly got scared today.

540
00:32:04,868 --> 00:32:06,668
Don't get scared over nothing.

541
00:32:07,908 --> 00:32:09,709
My son.

542
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:12,479
Have some fruit before you go in.

("Science", Man Sae, year 2, class 2, number 36)

544
00:32:31,098 --> 00:32:34,068
Man Sae.

545
00:32:42,578 --> 00:32:46,378
I need to hold out until he goes to college.

(Lee Man Sic)

547
00:33:07,628 --> 00:33:10,138
There are no relationships that are 100 percent bad.

548
00:33:10,199 --> 00:33:12,539
Life is full of ironies.

549
00:33:12,709 --> 00:33:16,408
Something good that happens now might begin something bad,

550
00:33:16,408 --> 00:33:18,638
and something that's seemingly bad now...

551
00:33:18,638 --> 00:33:21,479
may become the beginning of something good.

552
00:33:22,049 --> 00:33:25,019
Relationships between people are also as such.

553
00:33:25,049 --> 00:33:29,588
One day, you can smile thinking of your ill-fated relationships and...

554
00:33:36,699 --> 00:33:39,328
His elder is offering him a hand first.

555
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:42,269
There's no way he can turn that down.

(Episode 4)

557
00:33:53,465 --> 00:33:55,305
There's Mr. Ga.

558
00:33:55,305 --> 00:33:57,205
- Good morning. - Hello.

559
00:33:57,205 --> 00:33:59,205
- Hello. - You're here, Mr. Ga.

560
00:33:59,635 --> 00:34:02,145
Mr. Ga, would you like a cup of morning coffee?

561
00:34:02,145 --> 00:34:04,245
Do you want a cup of cold iced coffee?

562
00:34:08,384 --> 00:34:10,445
So this is your plan?

563
00:34:11,985 --> 00:34:15,055
I don't drink the coffee here.

564
00:34:15,254 --> 00:34:16,884
- Should I go and buy one instead? - Would you?

565
00:34:16,884 --> 00:34:18,695
Of course, let me know.

566
00:34:18,954 --> 00:34:23,524
Well. I take an espresso lungo,

567
00:34:23,524 --> 00:34:25,695
then make it into dry cappuccino with whipped cream,

568
00:34:25,695 --> 00:34:28,164
topped with chocolate drizzle and powdered cinnamon.

569
00:34:30,935 --> 00:34:31,935
Everyone, make your order.

570
00:34:31,935 --> 00:34:34,534
Goodness. How can an old man like him get that?

571
00:34:34,534 --> 00:34:37,075
You should either make Ms. Lee or Ms. Joo do it.

572
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:39,015
- Yes, we'll go. - Yes.

573
00:34:40,774 --> 00:34:41,844
What should I do, Mr. Lee?

574
00:34:41,844 --> 00:34:43,384
I'll go.

575
00:34:43,384 --> 00:34:45,655
See that? Make your order.

576
00:34:46,055 --> 00:34:47,055
Here's my credit card.

577
00:34:48,784 --> 00:34:50,954
Then iced Americano with an extra shot for me.

578
00:34:51,254 --> 00:34:53,924
- I'll take iced Americano too. - Iced Americano for me too.

579
00:34:54,765 --> 00:34:57,064
- Iced Americano. - Caramel macchiato, iced.

580
00:34:57,064 --> 00:34:58,495
Please stamp my card.

581
00:34:59,665 --> 00:35:00,795
Okay.

582
00:35:01,605 --> 00:35:05,804
One iced caramel macchiato.

583
00:35:06,034 --> 00:35:09,605
Five iced Americano.

584
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,444
- One second. - Pardon?

585
00:35:13,275 --> 00:35:15,985
Espresso doppio...

586
00:35:16,885 --> 00:35:17,885
Londo.

587
00:35:18,655 --> 00:35:21,325
Let's see. Very dry...

588
00:35:21,985 --> 00:35:23,355
cappuccino.

589
00:35:24,825 --> 00:35:27,625
- What does this... - I'll take that.

590
00:35:28,424 --> 00:35:29,625
One iced macchiato.

591
00:35:29,625 --> 00:35:31,334
5 iced Americano, but 1 with an extra shot.

592
00:35:31,334 --> 00:35:34,235
Espresso doppio in lungo, dry cappuccino with whipped cream,

593
00:35:34,235 --> 00:35:36,064
topped with chocolate drizzle and cinnamon powder.

594
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:37,064
Okay.

595
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,135
Is that all?

596
00:35:39,075 --> 00:35:41,075
- Next, please. - The coupon.

597
00:35:44,444 --> 00:35:47,375
Mr. Lee asked me yesterday...

598
00:35:47,375 --> 00:35:50,545
to make him work exactly like other young interns.

599
00:35:51,114 --> 00:35:52,855
He said that's how I can help him.

600
00:35:53,554 --> 00:35:54,954
I knew it, Mr. Ga.

601
00:35:56,054 --> 00:35:59,355
We were prejudice against him because he was too old.

602
00:35:59,355 --> 00:36:02,265
We didn't make him work, but we talked behind his back.

603
00:36:03,124 --> 00:36:05,135
We learn from you yet again, Mr. Ga.

604
00:36:05,765 --> 00:36:08,065
You can never learn enough. Isn't that so?

605
00:36:08,434 --> 00:36:09,804
- Yes. - Yes.

606
00:36:09,934 --> 00:36:11,334
Good. You two answer me so well too.

607
00:36:21,485 --> 00:36:23,345
What's taking the coffee this long?

608

(Marketing and Sales Department)

609
00:36:42,005 --> 00:36:43,005
Thanks.

610
00:36:44,975 --> 00:36:46,334
- Here. - Thank you.

611
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:49,975
Oh, right.

612
00:36:51,045 --> 00:36:53,445
I should've asked you to get us some sandwiches.

613
00:36:53,545 --> 00:36:55,515
I don't have enough time to eat.

614
00:36:58,684 --> 00:37:00,214
I'll go back.

615
00:37:00,315 --> 00:37:01,385
Will you?

616
00:37:01,985 --> 00:37:04,524
Then can you go to the Metro Sandwich...

617
00:37:04,524 --> 00:37:07,595
and get me bacon basil shrimp BLT?

618
00:37:10,894 --> 00:37:13,635
Don't let the bread get too crispy. A medium crisp will do.

619
00:37:13,635 --> 00:37:17,204
Double cheese, no cucumbers, add jalapenos, and raw onion.

620
00:37:17,204 --> 00:37:20,105
Hot chili sauce and Thousand Island in 3 to 7 ratio...

621
00:37:20,105 --> 00:37:21,704
No, in 4 to 6 ratio.

622
00:37:21,704 --> 00:37:25,744
Then top it with a bit of truffle oil, salt, and pepper.

623
00:37:28,915 --> 00:37:30,084
Okay?

624
00:37:30,865 --> 00:37:33,104
If anyone else wants a sandwich, go ahead and order.

625
00:37:34,104 --> 00:37:35,104
It's on me.

626
00:37:35,974 --> 00:37:38,645
Goodness, how can an old man like him get that order?

627
00:37:38,645 --> 00:37:42,515
No, no! Enough with your prejudice.

628
00:37:42,515 --> 00:37:44,745
You just learned from Mr. Ga.

629
00:37:45,585 --> 00:37:47,284
Here. Take the card.

630
00:37:49,754 --> 00:37:52,784
Hot chili sauce and Thousand Island in 3 to 7 ratio...

631
00:37:52,784 --> 00:37:54,455
No, in 4 to 6 ratio.

632
00:37:54,455 --> 00:37:58,395
Then top it with a bit of truffle oil, salt, and pepper.

633
00:37:58,465 --> 00:38:01,295
Okay? If anyone else wants some, go ahead and order.

634
00:38:01,295 --> 00:38:02,295
It's on me.

635
00:38:02,295 --> 00:38:04,435
Goodness, how can an old man like him get that order?

636
00:38:04,435 --> 00:38:08,175
No, no! Enough with your prejudice.

637
00:38:17,115 --> 00:38:20,485
That jerk has it in for me.

638
00:38:36,064 --> 00:38:38,035
What is this energy?

639
00:38:38,964 --> 00:38:41,035
This isn't enough.

640
00:38:45,374 --> 00:38:48,475
Gosh, it's raining. When did it start raining?

641
00:38:49,615 --> 00:38:51,685
I was too focused to notice.

642
00:38:52,785 --> 00:38:54,915
Sir, what should we have for dinner?

643
00:38:55,754 --> 00:38:56,785
Any ideas?

644
00:38:56,785 --> 00:39:00,124
Since it's raining, how about we have some hot pollack soup?

645
00:39:00,324 --> 00:39:02,295
How about seafood kalguksu?

646
00:39:02,295 --> 00:39:03,725
There's that tasty place nearby.

647
00:39:04,624 --> 00:39:05,894
What do you think, Mr. Lee?

648
00:39:06,264 --> 00:39:10,394
I like both pollack soup and seafood kalguksu.

649
00:39:13,134 --> 00:39:16,334
Since it's raining, let's have something hot and spicy.

650
00:39:16,535 --> 00:39:18,004
How about hot, spicy pizza?

651
00:39:20,105 --> 00:39:22,345
"Hot, spicy pizza"?

652
00:39:23,415 --> 00:39:26,285
That guy always needs some kind of broth when eating.

653
00:39:28,655 --> 00:39:31,155
Are you trying to kill me with bread?

654
00:39:31,254 --> 00:39:33,285
You forced me to eat it for lunch as well.

655
00:39:36,194 --> 00:39:38,124
(Yes, you are amazing today once again.)

656
00:39:41,595 --> 00:39:45,964
It's not bad to have hot, spicy pizza on a rainy day.

657
00:39:46,435 --> 00:39:47,605
Right, Ms. Lee?

658
00:39:50,574 --> 00:39:52,805
Yes, it's scrumptious.

659
00:39:55,644 --> 00:39:56,874
You're eating really well.

660
00:39:56,874 --> 00:39:58,115
It's delicious.

661
00:39:59,245 --> 00:40:00,685
It's really good.

662
00:40:03,655 --> 00:40:04,785
You're eating so well.

663
00:40:08,995 --> 00:40:10,155
- Come here and eat. - Okay.

664
00:40:10,655 --> 00:40:14,394
There should always be some broth during a meal.

665
00:40:15,365 --> 00:40:17,964
Hot, spicy pizza, my foot.

666
00:40:18,665 --> 00:40:20,564
What are you doing here?

667
00:40:23,035 --> 00:40:25,845
I was going to tell you anyway.

668
00:40:26,874 --> 00:40:28,874
He and I are childhood friends.

669
00:40:29,374 --> 00:40:32,045
I just got him something to eat while ordering mine.

670
00:40:32,045 --> 00:40:33,045
What's wrong?

671
00:40:34,084 --> 00:40:36,185
Well... You see...

672
00:40:36,454 --> 00:40:40,225
He wanted both jjamppong and tangsuyuk.

673
00:40:40,454 --> 00:40:43,624
But the set menu required him to order two bowls of jjamppong.

674
00:40:43,624 --> 00:40:46,124
They sold beef brisket jjamppong as a set menu?

675
00:40:51,735 --> 00:40:53,865
What are you doing here?

676
00:40:53,865 --> 00:40:56,935
How dare you come in here and scold him?

677
00:40:57,105 --> 00:40:58,874
Can't you see that we're eating?

678
00:40:58,874 --> 00:41:01,274
Stop it. I'm fine.

679
00:41:01,444 --> 00:41:04,675
You're not helping me at all.

680
00:41:04,845 --> 00:41:05,944
Sang Jong.

681
00:41:06,144 --> 00:41:07,915
This is no place for your personal relationships.

682
00:41:08,584 --> 00:41:09,584
"Sang Jong"?

683
00:41:09,584 --> 00:41:11,785
Hey! This is my room!

684
00:41:11,785 --> 00:41:14,555
He's calling me by my first name in my room,

685
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:16,124
so what's it to you?

686
00:41:16,925 --> 00:41:17,925
Not at all, sir.

687
00:41:18,865 --> 00:41:21,595
I'm sorry, sir. I am.

688
00:41:23,295 --> 00:41:24,964
Let's talk outside, sir.

689
00:41:25,165 --> 00:41:26,464
Where do you think you're going?

690
00:41:26,935 --> 00:41:28,334
Aren't you going to eat this?

691
00:41:32,305 --> 00:41:36,045
May I quickly eat first?

692
00:41:37,274 --> 00:41:41,144
Your colleagues are stuffing dry bread in their mouths.

693
00:41:43,415 --> 00:41:46,324
How could you even think about slurping on that broth?

694
00:41:52,595 --> 00:41:54,264
I'm not the one who ordered pizza.

695
00:41:56,264 --> 00:41:58,964
What? Hey, eat this first.

696
00:41:59,735 --> 00:42:00,805
Just take it home.

697
00:42:11,014 --> 00:42:14,084
It's raining today. We haven't had a drink in a while.

698
00:42:20,954 --> 00:42:25,094
- Here you go. - Thank you.

699
00:42:28,964 --> 00:42:32,165
I heard that some interesting interns joined you.

700
00:42:34,535 --> 00:42:35,704
Yes.

701
00:42:38,844 --> 00:42:42,145
All those oddballs during the interviews...

702
00:42:42,145 --> 00:42:44,214
joined your team. Will you be all right?

703
00:42:44,944 --> 00:42:48,885
If I guide them properly, I'm sure they'll be outstanding.

704
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:52,755
You're amazing. There's no boss like you.

705
00:42:53,324 --> 00:42:54,454
You're flattering me.

706
00:42:55,625 --> 00:42:58,194
By the way, are you fine with drinking alone with me?

707
00:42:58,464 --> 00:42:59,824
- Sorry? - I mean,

708
00:42:59,824 --> 00:43:02,594
there were rumors at the company about us dating.

709
00:43:03,035 --> 00:43:04,895
It's possible since we're both good-looking.

710
00:43:06,864 --> 00:43:08,635
Why? Why are you laughing?

711
00:43:09,204 --> 00:43:10,775
I don't feel that great.

712
00:43:14,104 --> 00:43:15,474
Anyway,

713
00:43:16,415 --> 00:43:18,484
even if people talk about you,

714
00:43:18,484 --> 00:43:21,415
you can easily subdue them through your competence.

715
00:43:21,415 --> 00:43:22,454
You know that, right?

716
00:43:23,454 --> 00:43:24,484
I do.

717
00:43:27,755 --> 00:43:28,895
I'm always grateful.

718
00:43:29,694 --> 00:43:31,155
You know you're a great supporter, right?

719
00:43:31,155 --> 00:43:34,525
Don't be ridiculous. I'm the one who's grateful.

720
00:43:35,194 --> 00:43:36,895
Thanks to you, I'm in this position.

721
00:43:40,035 --> 00:43:42,135
Did you say people from Hauhau are visiting us tomorrow?

722
00:43:42,234 --> 00:43:43,234
Yes.

723
00:43:43,635 --> 00:43:46,104
Those from Mongolia are after them as well.

724
00:43:46,104 --> 00:43:47,244
Will you be all right?

725
00:43:49,645 --> 00:43:50,744
I'm not too sure,

726
00:43:51,785 --> 00:43:52,785
but I'll have to try.

727
00:44:05,265 --> 00:44:06,295
Ma'am.

728
00:44:06,795 --> 00:44:08,224
Here.

729
00:44:08,224 --> 00:44:09,234
Thank you.

730
00:44:09,464 --> 00:44:10,464
Thank you.

731
00:44:19,344 --> 00:44:20,675
You look so haggard.

732
00:44:21,175 --> 00:44:22,714
Mr. Ga must be giving you a hard time.

733
00:44:25,344 --> 00:44:26,415
Not at all, sir.

734
00:44:29,285 --> 00:44:32,525
I wanted to see you in private for some time now.

735
00:44:32,525 --> 00:44:33,885
I'm sorry it took so long.

736
00:44:34,385 --> 00:44:35,925
I had no idea you were struggling so much.

737
00:44:38,055 --> 00:44:40,564
So why did you want to see me?

738
00:44:40,564 --> 00:44:43,295
I'm going to be straightforward with you.

739
00:44:46,505 --> 00:44:48,875
- Make Mr. Ga struggle. - Sorry?

740
00:44:48,875 --> 00:44:51,875
Six months from now, they'll be voting for the CEO.

741
00:44:51,875 --> 00:44:53,675
They'll be picking the board members.

742
00:44:53,675 --> 00:44:56,915
Please make sure he doesn't undermine me.

743
00:44:59,344 --> 00:45:00,844
I'm a mere intern.

744
00:45:01,785 --> 00:45:03,314
I have no power.

745
00:45:03,584 --> 00:45:07,854
Not at all. You're the only one who can do this.

746
00:45:07,854 --> 00:45:09,425
Goodness.

747
00:45:09,895 --> 00:45:11,755
What could I do?

748
00:45:11,755 --> 00:45:13,625
Nothing.

749
00:45:14,194 --> 00:45:15,234
Sorry?

750
00:45:16,035 --> 00:45:17,265
I don't understand.

751
00:45:17,265 --> 00:45:20,834
From the way I see it, he's already struggling.

752
00:45:20,964 --> 00:45:23,834
When you're having a hard time, you're bound to make a mistake.

753
00:45:24,604 --> 00:45:25,875
Just hang in there.

754
00:45:26,104 --> 00:45:28,814
Don't whine and talk about quitting.

755
00:45:28,814 --> 00:45:31,775
If you hold out, I'll repay you in any way you want.

756
00:45:34,415 --> 00:45:35,984
By "repay",

757
00:45:36,954 --> 00:45:40,655
do you mean you could hire me as a full-time employee?

758
00:45:40,655 --> 00:45:41,724
"Full-time"?

759
00:45:42,525 --> 00:45:45,425
Hey, that's not a big deal.

760
00:45:45,425 --> 00:45:47,694
Come on, I'm the boss here.

761
00:45:47,694 --> 00:45:49,334
What's with you? Goodness.

762
00:45:49,635 --> 00:45:51,765
Here, have some soju.

763
00:45:51,765 --> 00:45:52,765
Thank you.

764
00:45:53,305 --> 00:45:55,204
Goodness. Here you go.

765
00:45:57,334 --> 00:45:58,334
Drink.

766
00:46:00,275 --> 00:46:02,675
You can do it, Man Sic.

767
00:46:02,844 --> 00:46:05,045
That's right, that's right.

768
00:46:05,045 --> 00:46:09,515
It's not like he asked you to do something bad.

769
00:46:11,515 --> 00:46:13,425
He just wants you to hang in there.

770
00:46:16,724 --> 00:46:20,165
That's nothing. I can do that.

771
00:46:21,025 --> 00:46:23,635
My heyday is approaching once again.

772
00:46:32,275 --> 00:46:33,275
My goodness.

773
00:46:36,614 --> 00:46:37,775
What are you doing?

774
00:46:38,584 --> 00:46:39,614
Hey.

775
00:46:42,954 --> 00:46:43,984
Honey.

776
00:46:44,954 --> 00:46:47,484
Where's that red ginseng your mother brought last time?

777
00:46:47,484 --> 00:46:48,525
What?

778
00:46:48,525 --> 00:46:51,555
You said you didn't want it, so I've been giving it to Man Sae.

779
00:46:51,555 --> 00:46:54,265
You shouldn't. Give that to me.

780
00:46:54,265 --> 00:46:56,665
Why? Why all of a sudden?

781
00:47:02,875 --> 00:47:06,675
Mr. Lee, I'm meeting with a Chinese client. Come with me.

782
00:47:07,574 --> 00:47:08,775
I know you're good at that.

783
00:47:09,545 --> 00:47:10,574
Yes, sir.

784
00:47:11,775 --> 00:47:12,885
I'll come.

785
00:47:52,425 --> 00:47:55,185
You seemed to enjoy this place last time,

786
00:47:55,185 --> 00:47:57,994
so I made another reservation here. Is that okay with you?

787
00:47:58,765 --> 00:48:02,064
I couldn't forget this place. I've wanted to come back.

788
00:48:03,665 --> 00:48:05,265
I'm glad you liked it.

789
00:48:05,265 --> 00:48:07,064
I had such a good meal that day,

790
00:48:07,464 --> 00:48:08,905
so I gained weight.

791
00:48:13,275 --> 00:48:14,844
There's no interpreter?

792
00:48:15,844 --> 00:48:19,444
I canceled it because Mr. Ga told me to do so this morning.

793
00:48:19,515 --> 00:48:21,344
We can all speak a bit of Chinese anyway.

794
00:48:29,295 --> 00:48:32,364
You'll try to hurt my pride with my educational background?

795
00:48:37,535 --> 00:48:38,765
By the way, he's...

796
00:48:38,765 --> 00:48:41,135
Wait, did you bring an executive because this is a big contract?

797
00:48:41,135 --> 00:48:43,574
No, you don't have to get up.

798
00:48:45,275 --> 00:48:47,875
He came here to grill the meat.

799
00:48:49,375 --> 00:48:50,574
What happened? What?

800
00:48:50,574 --> 00:48:54,045
He's the best at grilling pork belly.

801
00:48:54,944 --> 00:48:58,984
I see. I knew it. He did exude an aura of a master.

802
00:49:01,954 --> 00:49:02,954
Mr. Lee.

803
00:49:03,224 --> 00:49:04,224
Yes?

804
00:49:04,555 --> 00:49:06,064
Come over here and grill the meat.

805
00:49:07,925 --> 00:49:08,935
Okay.

806
00:49:10,265 --> 00:49:12,135
Sure. Shall I?

807
00:49:30,655 --> 00:49:33,454
My time has come at last.

808
00:49:39,094 --> 00:49:43,295
I must place the pork belly after preheating the grill sufficiently.

809
00:49:44,234 --> 00:49:48,265
It's to quickly grill the meat while sealing in the juices.

810
00:49:53,775 --> 00:49:57,015
The masters know one ought to flip the pork belly...

811
00:49:57,015 --> 00:49:58,375
only twice.

812
00:49:58,375 --> 00:50:01,285
Flip it for the first time when the blood seeps out from the meat.

813
00:50:01,545 --> 00:50:04,785
And flip it again when the juice seeps out from the bottom side.

814
00:50:13,964 --> 00:50:15,864
Mr. Binghao, are you all right?

815
00:50:16,334 --> 00:50:17,395
I'm okay.

816
00:50:17,635 --> 00:50:18,635
I'm fine.

817
00:50:20,704 --> 00:50:24,805
I'm sorry. It's been 30 years since I last grilled meat.

818
00:50:24,805 --> 00:50:26,444
I made a mistake.

819
00:50:27,944 --> 00:50:29,944
- Let me grill the meat. - No.

820
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:31,645
I'll do it.

821
00:50:32,844 --> 00:50:34,084
I got the hang of it.

822
00:50:38,755 --> 00:50:40,354
- Come on! - My gosh.

823
00:50:41,025 --> 00:50:42,194
Are you all right?

824
00:50:43,755 --> 00:50:45,295
Did you get burned?

825
00:50:46,094 --> 00:50:47,594
Seung Jin, why don't you grill meat?

826
00:50:47,594 --> 00:50:49,135
- Okay. - Let's switch.

827
00:50:49,264 --> 00:50:51,034
Just come over here. And eat the meat.

828
00:50:51,034 --> 00:50:52,435
- No. - I'll do it.

829
00:50:52,435 --> 00:50:54,534
- I'll do it. - No, come on.

830
00:51:13,024 --> 00:51:14,784
- You... - My gosh.

831
00:51:15,524 --> 00:51:17,395
Do whatever it takes to stop him.

832
00:51:17,395 --> 00:51:20,065
Stop the contract from going through. Okay?

833
00:51:21,825 --> 00:51:23,065
Hey, by the way,

834
00:51:23,335 --> 00:51:27,034
the company will suffer from this. Is that the right thing to do?

835
00:51:27,034 --> 00:51:28,835
Why would the company suffer from this?

836
00:51:29,635 --> 00:51:32,504
Only Ga Yeol Chan will be suffering from this.

837
00:51:33,405 --> 00:51:34,704
If the contract falls through,

838
00:51:34,704 --> 00:51:37,615
we're going to try to steal back the contract he lost.

839
00:51:39,244 --> 00:51:43,754
Goodness. Even I thought that was a fantastic performance.

840
00:51:53,464 --> 00:51:54,964
- Thank you. - Thank you.

841
00:51:56,595 --> 00:51:57,764
Binghao.

842
00:52:10,615 --> 00:52:12,815
- My gosh. - Goodness.

843
00:52:15,284 --> 00:52:16,355
Right here.

844
00:52:24,194 --> 00:52:26,325
My gosh, he totally got me.

845
00:52:27,264 --> 00:52:28,494
All right. That's not enough.

846
00:52:32,665 --> 00:52:34,065
- Binghao. - Me?

847
00:52:34,704 --> 00:52:35,704
Don't do it.

848
00:52:44,815 --> 00:52:46,685
Sorry.

849
00:52:47,044 --> 00:52:48,544
- What's wrong with you? - Are you okay?

850
00:52:48,784 --> 00:52:50,284
- Hey! - It's okay.

851
00:52:50,954 --> 00:52:52,425
I'm fine.

852
00:52:52,754 --> 00:52:54,355
Binghao.

853
00:52:54,355 --> 00:52:56,325
- No, stop that. - It's okay.

854
00:52:56,524 --> 00:52:57,855
My gosh. All right.

855
00:52:59,294 --> 00:53:01,464
There you go.

856
00:53:02,794 --> 00:53:04,565
Nice.

857
00:53:07,464 --> 00:53:09,734
- No. - Look.

858
00:53:10,105 --> 00:53:11,375
Look at that.

859
00:53:11,504 --> 00:53:13,004
- Binghao. - Wait, that's...

860
00:53:16,444 --> 00:53:17,444
Binghao.

861
00:53:18,375 --> 00:53:19,385
No.

862
00:53:48,345 --> 00:53:49,415
That jerk.

863
00:53:52,714 --> 00:53:55,615
I'll love you unconditionally

864
00:53:55,615 --> 00:53:56,685
Binghao.

865
00:53:57,585 --> 00:53:59,954
- Unbelievable. What are you doing? - Hey.

866
00:54:00,125 --> 00:54:01,754
It's all right.

867
00:54:02,754 --> 00:54:03,754
It's okay.

868
00:54:06,994 --> 00:54:10,565
Call me when you need me

869
00:54:10,565 --> 00:54:13,835
I'll run to you whenever

870
00:54:13,835 --> 00:54:17,034
You can call me during the day and night

871
00:54:17,034 --> 00:54:20,704
- I'll run to you whenever - You can call me

872
00:54:20,704 --> 00:54:24,075
When other people call me

873
00:54:24,075 --> 00:54:27,145
I'll think about it for a long time

874
00:54:27,145 --> 00:54:28,145
Binghao.

875
00:54:29,185 --> 00:54:30,185
Look at me.

876
00:54:37,194 --> 00:54:43,365
I have unconditional love for you

877
00:54:44,794 --> 00:54:50,504
My love for you is special

878
00:54:50,774 --> 00:54:52,675
All right. Cheers.

879
00:54:52,675 --> 00:54:55,474
- Cheers. - Cheers.

880
00:54:55,675 --> 00:54:59,915
- Cheers. - Cheers.

881
00:54:59,915 --> 00:55:03,554
Mr. Binghao, I can't drink anymore. I'll drink Sprite.

882
00:55:03,554 --> 00:55:05,585
- Hey, drink that. - No.

883
00:55:08,254 --> 00:55:11,554
Mr. Binghao hates it when someone can outdrink him.

884
00:55:11,554 --> 00:55:13,165
- Pretend that you can match him, - Binghao.

885
00:55:13,165 --> 00:55:14,694
- but you must let him outdrink you. - Cheers.

886
00:55:14,694 --> 00:55:15,694
Okay?

887
00:55:16,964 --> 00:55:19,435
Beat him. Outdrink him.

888
00:55:20,464 --> 00:55:21,964
Isn't that your strong suit?

889
00:55:22,875 --> 00:55:25,105
I won't lose. I won't.

890
00:55:27,605 --> 00:55:29,375
Hey, Binghao.

891
00:55:30,645 --> 00:55:33,044
Can you do this?

892
00:55:35,685 --> 00:55:37,454
I can't do that.

893
00:55:50,065 --> 00:55:52,764
What? Drink that.

894
00:55:59,444 --> 00:56:00,444
Binghao.

895
00:56:03,815 --> 00:56:06,145
1, 2, 3. Game over.

896
00:56:25,595 --> 00:56:28,264
I'm happy that we will be working together again.

897
00:56:28,835 --> 00:56:32,774
I'm happy to work with a reliable team.

898
00:56:33,004 --> 00:56:34,204
I'll trust your team.

899
00:56:34,744 --> 00:56:37,115
I hope we can work well together moving forward.

900
00:56:37,615 --> 00:56:39,744
I'll do my best.

901
00:56:53,724 --> 00:56:54,895
Rip the contract.

902
00:56:54,895 --> 00:56:56,764
No. I can't.

903
00:56:58,165 --> 00:56:59,165
No.

904
00:57:01,704 --> 00:57:04,804
I wish you a safe trip back. Thank you once again.

905
00:57:04,804 --> 00:57:07,905
Thank you. I hope our companies work well together.

906
00:57:09,845 --> 00:57:12,075
Mr. Ga scored a big one once again.

907
00:57:12,075 --> 00:57:14,615
By the way, what happened last night?

908
00:57:19,155 --> 00:57:20,524
Thank you, Man Sic.

909
00:57:23,095 --> 00:57:24,095
"Man Sic"?

910
00:57:35,605 --> 00:57:36,605
What's wrong?

911
00:57:37,605 --> 00:57:38,974
Hey, are you okay?

912
00:57:41,345 --> 00:57:42,405
Are you okay?

913
00:57:45,415 --> 00:57:46,415
Hey.

914
00:57:47,145 --> 00:57:49,514
What's wrong with you? Hey, Mr. Bing.

915
00:58:05,034 --> 00:58:06,204
Hey, are you all right?

916
00:58:12,204 --> 00:58:13,575
Man Sic...

917
00:58:22,544 --> 00:58:25,954
Man Sic, don't tell my team that I threw up.

918
00:58:26,554 --> 00:58:29,395
If they found out, I'll be teased for life.

919
00:58:29,754 --> 00:58:32,825
What are you talking about right after you almost died?

920
00:58:34,294 --> 00:58:35,994
What? You won't do it for free?

921
00:58:36,095 --> 00:58:37,835
Do whatever you want.

922
00:58:42,234 --> 00:58:43,274
Fine, then.

923
00:58:43,875 --> 00:58:45,635
Since you saved my life,

924
00:58:46,845 --> 00:58:48,974
I'll sign the contract with your company. Happy?

925
00:58:48,974 --> 00:58:50,115
Sure.

926
00:58:50,115 --> 00:58:51,544
- Okay? - Okay.

927
00:58:52,345 --> 00:58:53,484
Do we have a deal?

928
00:58:53,484 --> 00:58:55,315
Okay. Yes, okay.

929
00:58:56,054 --> 00:58:58,655
Why is that young kid calling me by my name?

930
00:58:58,655 --> 00:59:00,385
Go away.

931
00:59:04,125 --> 00:59:05,194
Goodness.

932
00:59:07,365 --> 00:59:08,365
- Hey. - Hey.

933
00:59:09,565 --> 00:59:10,764
Did he leave something behind?

934
00:59:30,214 --> 00:59:31,554
What happened?

935
00:59:35,284 --> 00:59:37,194
You said it'll be tough to seal that deal.

936
00:59:37,355 --> 00:59:39,024
You've worked so hard, Mr. Ga.

937
00:59:43,435 --> 00:59:44,734
Then who?

938
01:00:03,454 --> 01:00:04,514
Well.

939
01:00:05,954 --> 01:00:06,984
Mr. Ga!

940
01:00:07,925 --> 01:00:09,325
We should relieve our hangover.

941
01:00:10,294 --> 01:00:11,754
Goodness, look at the time.

942
01:00:13,024 --> 01:00:14,365
Let's all eat lunch.

943
01:00:15,694 --> 01:00:16,935
Why don't we eat...

944
01:00:17,794 --> 01:00:18,994
Shock Shock Burger for lunch?

945
01:00:18,994 --> 01:00:22,105
What? Burger? Did he just say burgers?

946
01:00:28,645 --> 01:00:29,875
Gosh, I don't feel well.

947
01:00:29,875 --> 01:00:31,514
Hey, put that away.

948
01:00:33,585 --> 01:00:35,214
It smells, man.

949
01:00:36,454 --> 01:00:38,085
Yes, the smell is coming at me.

950
01:00:38,514 --> 01:00:39,784
Try some.

951
01:02:12,075 --> 01:02:14,185
Don't you think Mr. Ga is insane?

952
01:02:14,585 --> 01:02:18,155
How can we eat burgers after we drank so much last night?

953
01:02:18,815 --> 01:02:20,325
Yes, exactly.

954
01:02:21,085 --> 01:02:23,925
And he told someone who's old enough to be his dad to grill meat.

955
01:02:24,155 --> 01:02:26,095
- I loathe that. - "Loathe"?

956
01:02:27,524 --> 01:02:30,034
What has gotten into him lately?

957
01:02:31,665 --> 01:02:34,165
People should always be consistent.

958
01:02:34,165 --> 01:02:36,704
Is he crazy for money? He's really annoying.

959
01:02:38,004 --> 01:02:40,905
Mr. Oh, you should be consistent too.

960
01:03:03,135 --> 01:03:06,264
That's when I reached this conviction.

961
01:03:07,304 --> 01:03:09,105
You stand no chance against me.

962
01:03:16,744 --> 01:03:19,044
Something is seriously wrong.

963
01:03:52,675 --> 01:03:54,415
(Kkondae Intern)

964
01:03:57,815 --> 01:03:59,554
Those young jerks.

965
01:04:00,484 --> 01:04:03,694
I'll destroy you all. I'll get you all.

966
01:04:03,994 --> 01:04:07,794
Mr. Lee, you aren't a stumbling block, but a stepping stone.

967
01:04:08,065 --> 01:04:10,034
Don't you know who Hye Soo is?

968
01:04:10,034 --> 01:04:12,294
Hye Soo? Do you want me to call her?

969
01:04:12,294 --> 01:04:15,405
Hye Soo, can you do this for me?

970
01:04:15,405 --> 01:04:18,034
I really can't do this to you if I think about our old days.

971
01:04:18,034 --> 01:04:20,744
I apologize for how rude I was without recognizing you.

972
01:04:20,744 --> 01:04:22,345
What is this? Are you a troublemaker?

973
01:04:22,345 --> 01:04:24,345
Why do you always get in trouble?

974
01:04:24,345 --> 01:04:26,345
A man might have died because of you!

975
01:04:26,345 --> 01:04:28,214
No one is dying because of me!

976
01:04:28,214 --> 01:04:29,954
Enough is enough!

977
01:04:29,954 --> 01:04:31,615
Car. Watch out for the car!
