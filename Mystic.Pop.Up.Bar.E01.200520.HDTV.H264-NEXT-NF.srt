MYSTIC POP-UP BAR

2
00:00:11,979 --> 00:00:14,356
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGION AND INCIDENTS

3
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,941
PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

4
00:01:46,824 --> 00:01:48,284
Did you see anything?

5
00:01:48,367 --> 00:01:50,452
Her husband died recently, didn't he?

6
00:01:50,536 --> 00:01:53,706
That's right.
It's been three months and a half.

7
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,208
There's an issue with his burial site.

8
00:01:56,292 --> 00:01:58,460
Bad energy is preventing him
from resting in peace.

9
00:01:58,544 --> 00:02:00,254
-Bad energy?
-Yes.

10
00:02:00,796 --> 00:02:03,215
He's been yelling at her in her dreams.

11
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:05,676
Moving him to a sunny place

12
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,594
will restore her health.

13
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:12,057
EPISODE 1

14
00:02:12,141 --> 00:02:14,351
Weol-ju, are you on your way home?

15
00:02:14,435 --> 00:02:17,479
Yes. Have you been sleeping well
at nights now?

16
00:02:17,563 --> 00:02:20,524
Of course, and it's all thanks to you.

17
00:02:20,816 --> 00:02:21,817
I'm glad.

18
00:02:24,486 --> 00:02:26,822
Has your sister's engagement
been sorted out?

19
00:02:27,281 --> 00:02:31,160
Yes. If it weren't for you,
he would've fooled us all.

20
00:02:31,702 --> 00:02:34,621
He had a wife and child on the side!

21
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:38,542
No wonder some woman
kept popping up in your sister's dream.

22
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,044
Tell me about it.

23
00:02:41,545 --> 00:02:43,505
You have no idea how relieved I am.

24
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:47,009
-Anyway, good day.
-You too.

25
00:02:47,092 --> 00:02:48,135
Goodness.

26
00:03:13,869 --> 00:03:15,996
I've been praying with all my heart,

27
00:03:17,164 --> 00:03:19,208
but why hasn't the Crown Prince
gotten better?

28
00:03:19,792 --> 00:03:20,834
Oh, Sacred Tree,

29
00:03:21,251 --> 00:03:23,045
I urge you for a response.

30
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,089
My Queen.

31
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:33,931
Really? Such a girl exists?

32
00:03:36,975 --> 00:03:40,312
I told you to stop this.
Why won't you listen to your mother?

33
00:03:41,063 --> 00:03:43,857
How can I turn a blind eye
to an old lady in pain?

34
00:03:43,941 --> 00:03:47,361
I'm glad to have an ability like this
to help my neighbors.

35
00:03:47,444 --> 00:03:49,321
I don't want my fate to become yours too.

36
00:03:49,905 --> 00:03:50,906
Why not?

37
00:03:51,073 --> 00:03:55,077
I'm proud of myself
every time someone tells me

38
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,703
I brought them life and joy.

39
00:03:57,246 --> 00:03:59,665
-It's electrifying.
-Unbelievable.

40
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:04,044
You're old enough now.
You should think about marrying instead.

41
00:04:05,212 --> 00:04:07,131
I asked the matchmaker
to set you up with someone,

42
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:10,217
so don't voice your resistance
and stay out of trouble.

43
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:12,010
But that's not something I want.

44
00:04:12,886 --> 00:04:15,973
Love is supposed to be like fate.

45
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:18,475
Once the love of my fate appears,

46
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:21,645
I'll marry even if you tell me not to,
so don't rush me.

47
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:23,480
Always so naive.

48
00:04:24,231 --> 00:04:26,859
Forget about it. It's my fault
for wanting a mature response.

49
00:04:28,694 --> 00:04:31,738
Weol-ju, receive the royal command!

50
00:04:37,244 --> 00:04:38,579
Are you Weol-ju?

51
00:04:39,163 --> 00:04:40,539
Yes, Your Majesty.

52
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:42,875
I hear that your mother is a shaman.

53
00:04:44,334 --> 00:04:45,210
Yes.

54
00:04:46,587 --> 00:04:49,131
I'm ordering you to read
the Crown Prince's dreams.

55
00:05:15,324 --> 00:05:16,366
What's wrong?

56
00:05:17,159 --> 00:05:18,285
There...

57
00:05:19,161 --> 00:05:21,663
-There are too many.
-Too many of what?

58
00:05:22,414 --> 00:05:25,834
The vengeful spirits of those
who died in the hands of the royal family

59
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:29,338
are haunting the Crown Prince
in his dreams.

60
00:05:29,671 --> 00:05:31,215
What? Vengeful spirits?

61
00:05:36,178 --> 00:05:39,181
Then what can we do to annihilate them?

62
00:05:41,225 --> 00:05:44,061
Actually, they need to be comforted.

63
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:47,689
Dig up the bodies buried in the woods,

64
00:05:47,773 --> 00:05:49,483
move them to graves where the sun hits,

65
00:05:49,942 --> 00:05:51,109
and have a memorial service.

66
00:05:51,193 --> 00:05:53,904
How can we find the buried bodies though?

67
00:05:57,491 --> 00:05:59,117
Please spare me a few days.

68
00:05:59,201 --> 00:06:02,162
I will hear the spirits out
and tell you where.

69
00:06:09,127 --> 00:06:10,837
Sure. Go ahead.

70
00:06:12,422 --> 00:06:16,301
To save the Crown Prince's life,
I'm willing to do anything.

71
00:07:16,486 --> 00:07:18,238
You won't enter his chambers again?

72
00:07:18,739 --> 00:07:21,617
Yes, I've comforted
the vengeful spirits haunting him

73
00:07:22,284 --> 00:07:26,288
and his dreams seem to be
more pleasant now.

74
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,081
It's as you said.

75
00:07:28,332 --> 00:07:31,126
There's color back on his face again

76
00:07:31,209 --> 00:07:32,628
and he's even smiling now.

77
00:07:32,711 --> 00:07:34,379
I couldn't be more grateful.

78
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,632
You saved him.

79
00:07:36,715 --> 00:07:39,509
No, you save the royal family.

80
00:07:40,218 --> 00:07:42,095
I'll make sure you are well compensated.

81
00:07:42,679 --> 00:07:43,597
That's not necessary.

82
00:07:44,056 --> 00:07:47,476
I'm glad I was able to help His Highness.

83
00:07:47,559 --> 00:07:50,395
Still, it'd be wrong of me
not to thank you.

84
00:08:19,091 --> 00:08:21,718
Your Highness,
now that you're back to full health,

85
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:26,306
His Majesty has ordered you
to proceed with your studies again.

86
00:08:29,184 --> 00:08:30,435
Your Highness?

87
00:08:35,273 --> 00:08:36,942
Doesn't His Highness seem odd to you?

88
00:08:37,442 --> 00:08:39,111
He smirks at odd moments

89
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,406
and only responds
after he is called many times.

90
00:08:42,489 --> 00:08:45,617
It's as if he's bewitched.

91
00:08:46,034 --> 00:08:47,160
I feel awful, Your Majesty.

92
00:08:47,744 --> 00:08:49,579
He's been this way for several days now,

93
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,748
but the royal physician said
he's perfectly fine.

94
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:53,959
Could it perhaps

95
00:08:54,918 --> 00:08:58,004
be a side effect
of the human dream catcher's service?

96
00:09:04,678 --> 00:09:06,430
Bring Weol-ju back here.

97
00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:12,144
That minx, Weol-ju, now has it good
after her trip to the palace.

98
00:09:12,227 --> 00:09:14,229
I hear she scored
a large sum of valuables.

99
00:09:14,563 --> 00:09:15,564
No way.

100
00:09:15,647 --> 00:09:18,316
They wouldn't have given her all that
for yapping about some dreams.

101
00:09:19,234 --> 00:09:22,070
She probably serviced
the Crown Prince well every night.

102
00:09:22,154 --> 00:09:24,448
I think she's on a path
to becoming his concubine.

103
00:09:24,531 --> 00:09:25,615
-What?
-That minx

104
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:28,243
must've seduced him in his dreams!

105
00:09:28,827 --> 00:09:31,955
How else could the Crown Prince
be mesmerized by her?

106
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:34,416
She got him so good

107
00:09:34,499 --> 00:09:37,502
that he comes by
to see her every night now.

108
00:09:37,836 --> 00:09:40,172
I knew it. Those born of lowly status

109
00:09:40,255 --> 00:09:42,174
only know how to sell their bodies.

110
00:09:42,257 --> 00:09:43,425
-My gosh.
-Goodness.

111
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:18,126
Why are you telling me
to dress in your clothes?

112
00:10:18,752 --> 00:10:21,421
Go to your uncle's in Suwon.
You're running out of time.

113
00:10:22,964 --> 00:10:25,550
-You need to tie your hair in a bun.
-A bun, too?

114
00:10:26,301 --> 00:10:27,928
Mother, why are you being this way?

115
00:10:28,011 --> 00:10:30,180
People will point fingers
when they see an unmarried girl

116
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:31,431
wearing her head in a bun.

117
00:10:31,515 --> 00:10:32,682
Why would they?

118
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,436
A wedding
isn't the only confirmation of a marriage.

119
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,063
What matters is love.

120
00:10:40,732 --> 00:10:41,775
You knew?

121
00:10:47,489 --> 00:10:49,449
I'm sure you're aware
of the vicious rumors.

122
00:10:49,533 --> 00:10:52,911
Everyone's out
to put your neck on a stick now

123
00:10:52,994 --> 00:10:55,705
which means
you can no longer stay in Hanyang.

124
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,458
Leave and don't look back.

125
00:10:58,542 --> 00:10:59,793
But why are you

126
00:11:01,044 --> 00:11:03,004
making me leave alone?

127
00:11:11,763 --> 00:11:12,764
You won't be alone.

128
00:11:13,265 --> 00:11:14,766
Whenever you need extra strength,

129
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:19,646
hold this <i>binyeo</i> tightly.

130
00:11:20,897 --> 00:11:22,566
It will bring you the person

131
00:11:23,608 --> 00:11:25,068
you desperately seek.

132
00:11:26,361 --> 00:11:27,404
Tell me.

133
00:11:27,946 --> 00:11:30,073
Have I ever been wrong?

134
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:40,041
<i>Fire!</i>

135
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:42,460
<i>-There's a fire.
-My goodness.</i>

136
00:11:42,544 --> 00:11:45,130
<i>-Fire!
-The house is on fire.</i>

137
00:11:45,213 --> 00:11:47,007
<i>Everybody, there's a fire.</i>

138
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:48,633
<i>-Oh, dear!
-Fire!</i>

139
00:12:02,856 --> 00:12:05,609
Mother!

140
00:12:06,276 --> 00:12:07,611
Mother, no.

141
00:12:08,278 --> 00:12:11,281
Mother, please open your eyes.

142
00:12:12,282 --> 00:12:13,491
Mother.

143
00:12:14,659 --> 00:12:16,369
Please don't die.

144
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:19,205
Mother...

145
00:12:19,873 --> 00:12:21,791
It's all my fault.

146
00:12:22,751 --> 00:12:25,629
I'm so sorry.

147
00:12:26,338 --> 00:12:28,548
Mother, no...

148
00:12:33,637 --> 00:12:35,221
No!

149
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,188
Even in my death...

150
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:31,736
Even in my death, I will curse you all.

151
00:15:33,038 --> 00:15:38,132
MYSTIC POP-UP BAR

152
00:16:00,885 --> 00:16:02,554
But I didn't order this.

153
00:16:02,637 --> 00:16:05,682
It's a freebie for today's first customer,
so eat what I give you.

154
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:07,100
What will you drink?

155
00:16:08,017 --> 00:16:09,936
MYSTIC POP-UP BAR

156
00:16:10,728 --> 00:16:11,896
You can have Like a Boss.

157
00:16:13,231 --> 00:16:14,482
Why's that?

158
00:16:14,941 --> 00:16:17,110
You spent all day being tossed around,

159
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:19,529
so you should at least drink like a boss.

160
00:16:21,197 --> 00:16:25,160
<i>Bloodshot eyes, chapped lips,
and a yellow complexion.</i>

161
00:16:25,243 --> 00:16:26,619
<i>She's having a nervous breakdown.</i>

162
00:16:27,203 --> 00:16:30,290
<i>A grubby shirt and trembling hands too?</i>

163
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:32,250
<i>Look at the bags under her eyes.</i>

164
00:16:33,084 --> 00:16:34,502
Fine. I choose you today!

165
00:16:35,211 --> 00:16:36,212
Sorry?

166
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:39,674
It's nothing.

167
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:42,552
Go ahead and drink. Bottoms up.

168
00:16:50,351 --> 00:16:53,188
So what's going on?
You seem deeply troubled.

169
00:16:54,647 --> 00:16:56,065
Does it show?

170
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:58,109
Of course. I'm no noob, you know.

171
00:16:58,193 --> 00:17:00,570
I can tell by how you grab your glass.

172
00:17:04,574 --> 00:17:07,368
-Well...
-<i>Go on. Let me have it.</i>

173
00:17:12,081 --> 00:17:14,500
Forget it. It's nothing.

174
00:17:14,626 --> 00:17:16,878
That rotten face tells me
it isn't just nothing.

175
00:17:16,961 --> 00:17:18,463
Now, spill!

176
00:17:20,381 --> 00:17:22,508
You see, at my job--

177
00:17:22,592 --> 00:17:24,344
What about your job?

178
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,434
It's nothing.

179
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:34,103
I guess that's how life is, right?

180
00:17:35,104 --> 00:17:36,606
I shouldn't stress over it

181
00:17:37,482 --> 00:17:39,400
and be glad I'm still physically healthy.

182
00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:43,196
Forget it. Pay up before you eat.

183
00:17:43,905 --> 00:17:45,114
You said it was on the house.

184
00:17:45,198 --> 00:17:47,659
Why look for freebies
when you're physically fine?

185
00:17:47,742 --> 00:17:48,785
Pay up!

186
00:17:51,234 --> 00:17:52,652
MYSTIC POP-UP BAR

187
00:17:52,735 --> 00:17:54,695
MYSTIC POP-UP BAR 99990

188
00:17:55,947 --> 00:17:58,407
Getting up to 100,000 is no joke, is it?

189
00:18:00,785 --> 00:18:03,955
Serves you right for hanging yourself
to die on the Sacred Tree.

190
00:18:04,997 --> 00:18:08,626
Guibanjang, you say that like
I've caused you some inconvenience.

191
00:18:08,709 --> 00:18:11,295
If you had killed yourself
on some other random tree,

192
00:18:11,379 --> 00:18:12,880
we wouldn't have to do this.

193
00:18:12,964 --> 00:18:15,132
And now I'm here as the manager too.

194
00:18:15,633 --> 00:18:17,677
I went from catching evil spirits
to peeling onions.

195
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,428
How is this not messed up?

196
00:18:20,429 --> 00:18:21,931
Jeez, these sting.

197
00:18:22,014 --> 00:18:24,392
Suicide doesn't involve
rational thinking, you know.

198
00:18:26,727 --> 00:18:29,313
Anyway, I thought about it,
and a bar won't cut it.

199
00:18:29,856 --> 00:18:31,983
I should get into
another line of business.

200
00:18:34,735 --> 00:18:36,988
-How about I open my own online channel?
-What?

201
00:18:37,071 --> 00:18:40,783
A lot of people pour out
their worries via chat.

202
00:18:40,867 --> 00:18:42,994
It'll save them the trouble
of having to come down here,

203
00:18:43,077 --> 00:18:44,495
so it sounds perfect.

204
00:18:45,496 --> 00:18:47,915
That's only for people
who are gifted in that way.

205
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:50,585
You really don't know, do you?

206
00:18:53,713 --> 00:18:57,466
"Greetings, guys. I'm your host Weol-ju.

207
00:18:58,134 --> 00:19:01,846
Onion peeling Guibanjang,
thanks for the donation.

208
00:19:03,139 --> 00:19:05,141
You'll hit like
and press subscribe, right?"

209
00:19:09,186 --> 00:19:10,438
I sure am tempted to squash you.

210
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:14,066
No wonder people leave
all sorts of hate comments.

211
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:15,943
-What?
-They can't physically hurt people,

212
00:19:16,027 --> 00:19:17,320
so they can only use their words.

213
00:19:17,403 --> 00:19:19,155
Look at my fist trembling too.

214
00:19:19,238 --> 00:19:20,281
What?

215
00:19:23,659 --> 00:19:25,077
Onions aren't balls, you know.

216
00:19:25,912 --> 00:19:28,915
Look at you. You've gotten better at that.

217
00:19:30,374 --> 00:19:31,876
Are you kidding me?

218
00:19:32,793 --> 00:19:35,379
Do you have any idea
how much pressure I'm under?

219
00:19:35,463 --> 00:19:37,298
I need something to report
to the higher-ups.

220
00:19:37,381 --> 00:19:38,883
And you do.

221
00:19:38,966 --> 00:19:40,676
I haven't been slacking off.

222
00:19:41,552 --> 00:19:43,930
That can only be proved
with your achievements,

223
00:19:44,597 --> 00:19:49,185
but you haven't even opened the door
to the Dream World for six months.

224
00:19:49,268 --> 00:19:50,561
Tell them to give it a shot.

225
00:19:50,645 --> 00:19:53,272
It's not easy
to infiltrate a human's dreams

226
00:19:53,356 --> 00:19:54,607
and calm their worries.

227
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:57,485
If only they knew what I've been through.

228
00:19:59,236 --> 00:20:01,614
DREAM WORLD: HEUNGBU'S STORY

229
00:20:01,697 --> 00:20:03,532
<i>Little by little</i>

230
00:20:03,616 --> 00:20:05,576
<i>We saw and saw</i>

231
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,495
<i>Bring us the treasure</i>

232
00:20:07,578 --> 00:20:09,956
<i>Present the treasure</i>

233
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:11,040
What the...

234
00:20:18,214 --> 00:20:20,466
Why? What did I even do?

235
00:20:20,549 --> 00:20:22,134
As if you don't know.

236
00:20:26,263 --> 00:20:30,059
What's wrong is you being
a selfish and greedy bastard.

237
00:20:30,142 --> 00:20:32,770
You kicked your brother out,
took your father's inheritance,

238
00:20:32,853 --> 00:20:34,730
and slapped your brother
when he asked for help.

239
00:20:34,814 --> 00:20:37,984
That's not all. Blinded by greed,
you snapped a swallow's healthy leg.

240
00:20:39,527 --> 00:20:42,071
Now, do you know what you did wrong?

241
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:49,912
Chun-hyang, just look at
the state you're in.

242
00:20:50,663 --> 00:20:52,707
I can't stand it anymore.

243
00:20:53,457 --> 00:20:54,583
-What?
-Look.

244
00:20:55,543 --> 00:20:59,588
One can't possibly tell
if Lee Mong-ryong is coming back or not,

245
00:20:59,672 --> 00:21:02,466
so why must I wait like this?

246
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:05,594
He could've died
on his way to the state exam

247
00:21:05,678 --> 00:21:08,014
or locked eyes with another girl there.

248
00:21:08,097 --> 00:21:10,474
How can I know what happened?

249
00:21:10,558 --> 00:21:13,853
Still, maybe you should
wait a while longer.

250
00:21:13,936 --> 00:21:16,022
I should tell the governor straight away

251
00:21:16,731 --> 00:21:18,899
that I'm down for tonight.

252
00:21:18,983 --> 00:21:20,359
Chun-hyang!

253
00:21:20,443 --> 00:21:22,695
Let's not make any hasty decisions.

254
00:21:22,778 --> 00:21:25,448
Have a drink for now
and readdress your situation.

255
00:21:27,158 --> 00:21:30,661
I see this is the good stuff
you've been stashing away.

256
00:21:38,169 --> 00:21:39,086
This is the bomb.

257
00:21:41,589 --> 00:21:42,423
No way.

258
00:21:44,008 --> 00:21:44,967
Jeez, that's good.

259
00:21:53,184 --> 00:21:55,644
I didn't expect him to pop up in my dream.

260
00:21:57,438 --> 00:21:58,898
The paper flower hat must mean

261
00:21:59,815 --> 00:22:01,400
that he passed the state exam.

262
00:22:02,902 --> 00:22:03,903
All right.

263
00:22:04,862 --> 00:22:08,574
I've been waiting all this time,
so I can wait some more.

264
00:22:10,326 --> 00:22:12,953
<i>Here comes the royal inspector!</i>

265
00:22:19,293 --> 00:22:20,294
General MacArthur,

266
00:22:20,711 --> 00:22:23,339
you're drinking more than usual today.

267
00:22:23,423 --> 00:22:26,134
Yeah. Well, I have a lot on my mind lately.

268
00:22:26,217 --> 00:22:30,138
We have to find a way
to break through the lines of the enemy.

269
00:22:32,765 --> 00:22:35,643
I can think of nothing better
to solve your issues.

270
00:22:35,727 --> 00:22:36,686
MACARTHUR

271
00:22:36,769 --> 00:22:37,854
What's that?

272
00:22:42,274 --> 00:22:44,777
It's a sweet soju and beer cocktail.

273
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:48,197
Go ahead. Bottoms up.

274
00:22:48,281 --> 00:22:49,198
Thank you.

275
00:22:55,496 --> 00:22:56,497
Gentlemen,

276
00:22:57,749 --> 00:22:59,083
go to Incheon.

277
00:23:05,881 --> 00:23:08,259
I went to all that trouble

278
00:23:08,342 --> 00:23:10,469
to help out 99,990 cases,

279
00:23:10,553 --> 00:23:13,722
but you're telling me
that I've achieved nothing?

280
00:23:14,598 --> 00:23:16,142
You must have a death wish.

281
00:23:17,143 --> 00:23:20,771
Still, you need to help out ten more
and complete the count.

282
00:23:22,022 --> 00:23:25,609
Also, be more polite to your customers.

283
00:23:25,693 --> 00:23:28,821
It's as if you're bullying them
to tell you their worries.

284
00:23:28,904 --> 00:23:30,281
How will that ever work?

285
00:23:30,823 --> 00:23:33,993
Being too nice
will only make them back off more.

286
00:23:34,076 --> 00:23:36,579
Getting people to spill their guts
over a drink?

287
00:23:36,662 --> 00:23:38,038
That's old news now.

288
00:23:38,122 --> 00:23:40,958
People these days
don't spill their stories easily.

289
00:23:41,041 --> 00:23:43,627
Also, I've been visiting people
in the Dream World

290
00:23:43,711 --> 00:23:45,254
to appease their souls.

291
00:23:45,337 --> 00:23:47,214
How does one get politer than that?

292
00:23:47,548 --> 00:23:50,801
Fuck it. If I could,
I'd never speak to these people.

293
00:23:51,468 --> 00:23:53,637
Then at least give out more free dishes.

294
00:23:53,721 --> 00:23:55,556
Everyone likes free food.

295
00:23:56,682 --> 00:23:59,143
I have something to say about that.
As you know,

296
00:23:59,226 --> 00:24:01,437
people don't often come
to tent bars anymore.

297
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,856
I can't give them freebies
because they don't come.

298
00:24:03,939 --> 00:24:05,399
How am I supposed to compete

299
00:24:05,482 --> 00:24:08,027
with all these food delivery services?

300
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:09,737
If the higher-ups ask,

301
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:12,448
make sure to tell them
that times have changed

302
00:24:12,531 --> 00:24:15,242
and that I haven't been slacking off.

303
00:24:15,826 --> 00:24:18,704
You sure are commanding for someone
with a 500-year sentence.

304
00:24:18,787 --> 00:24:19,872
Jeez.

305
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,335
KAPEUL MART

<i>Kapeul Mart is open today

-Jeju black pork is on sale!

309

That's 25, 26, 27,

310
00:24:40,226 --> 00:24:42,895
28, 29...

311
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:47,441
One broke, so it's 29 in total.

312
00:24:47,816 --> 00:24:49,485
You checked three times, so are we good?

313
00:24:49,985 --> 00:24:51,904
-Then--
-Let me check one last time.

314

HAN KANG-BAE

315
00:25:02,456 --> 00:25:07,628
You know, the thing is
my youngest son is 29 years old,

316
00:25:07,711 --> 00:25:10,506
but he still hasn't gotten a job yet.

317
00:25:11,131 --> 00:25:13,801
I see, ma'am. You must be upsetting.

CUSTOMER SATISFACTION CENTER

00:25:25,396 --> 00:25:26,272
That's right.

322
00:25:26,814 --> 00:25:28,482
I am 36 years old.

323
00:25:29,066 --> 00:25:30,484
I met a man

324
00:25:31,443 --> 00:25:32,987
and was madly in love.

325
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:34,113
Pardon?

326
00:25:34,196 --> 00:25:36,949
People may point fingers at me
and call me a homewrecker.

327
00:25:38,158 --> 00:25:41,495
But it made our love become
more secretive,

328
00:25:42,121 --> 00:25:43,747
yet fervent.

329
00:25:45,541 --> 00:25:48,836
Our love was burning hot
like the magma, deep down on earth.

330
00:25:51,046 --> 00:25:53,007
I see.

331
00:25:56,343 --> 00:26:00,014
I will now announce
the kind employee of the month.

332
00:26:00,389 --> 00:26:01,598
All right.

333
00:26:03,684 --> 00:26:06,603
She won it five months in a row.
Isn't that a new record?

334
00:26:06,854 --> 00:26:08,939
Congrats, Ms. Song Mi-ran
from the meat section.

335
00:26:11,233 --> 00:26:12,151
-Again?
-I know.

336
00:26:15,612 --> 00:26:16,822
Give her a round of applause.

337
00:26:23,454 --> 00:26:24,621
That's impressive.

338
00:26:25,289 --> 00:26:27,249
She got picked for five straight months.

339
00:26:27,666 --> 00:26:30,794
Tell me about it. She and I started
on the same day as contract workers.

340
00:26:31,045 --> 00:26:32,796
I bet she'll get
a permanent position soon.

341
00:26:33,797 --> 00:26:34,882
If you're envious of her,

342
00:26:35,674 --> 00:26:37,760
you should do your job better.

343
00:26:39,094 --> 00:26:40,846
Stop chit chatting with customers.

344
00:26:41,305 --> 00:26:43,682
I'm sorry. I'll fix that.

345
00:26:44,725 --> 00:26:46,018
Come on, sir.

346
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:49,730
Kang-bae might be a bit slow
when handling his tasks,

347
00:26:50,105 --> 00:26:53,233
but his customers
were very satisfied with his help.

348
00:26:53,734 --> 00:26:55,944
It's a quality-over-quantity approach.

349
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:57,946
Don't you agree?

350
00:27:04,661 --> 00:27:07,373
It's getting late. I have an appointment.
I'll get going now.

351
00:27:07,956 --> 00:27:10,042
-Goodnight.
-Okay.

352
00:27:10,417 --> 00:27:11,543
Bye.

353
00:27:14,463 --> 00:27:15,798
Why did he dodge?

354
00:27:17,841 --> 00:27:18,842
Don't tell me

355
00:27:19,843 --> 00:27:21,595
you're bullying other employees.

356
00:27:23,097 --> 00:27:24,556
No. It's nothing like that.

357
00:27:24,723 --> 00:27:29,269
Kang-bae hates it
when other people touch him.

358
00:27:29,353 --> 00:27:32,147
Even at the supermarket,
he's like a loach.

359
00:27:32,481 --> 00:27:34,608
You should see how good he is
at dodging customers.

360
00:27:40,823 --> 00:27:41,782
Jin-tae!

361
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,869
Look at you, Kang-bae.
You haven't changed at all.

362
00:27:46,412 --> 00:27:48,914
How long has it been?
I haven't seen you after we graduated.

363
00:27:53,502 --> 00:27:55,254
Right. I forgot.

364
00:27:55,754 --> 00:27:56,839
Gosh, you're still the same.

365
00:27:56,922 --> 00:27:58,632
Well, you know.

366
00:27:59,007 --> 00:28:00,259
Let's sit.

367
00:28:01,969 --> 00:28:03,887
You're the first guy
who called me after...

368
00:28:05,472 --> 00:28:07,433
It was nice hearing from you. Thanks.

369
00:28:07,516 --> 00:28:08,517
Don't thank me.

370
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,310
I've been working my ass off
for my business.

371
00:28:10,394 --> 00:28:12,521
And all of a sudden, it got lonely.

372
00:28:12,604 --> 00:28:13,981
It made me think about you.

373
00:28:16,733 --> 00:28:18,026
-I'm sorry.
-Shit.

374
00:28:18,569 --> 00:28:19,736
Use this.

375
00:28:26,869 --> 00:28:28,078
Are you okay?

376
00:28:28,162 --> 00:28:29,872
If I'm okay, do you think I'd be here?

377
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:32,749
If things weren't bad,
why would I call you?

378
00:28:34,668 --> 00:28:36,253
Only a slow-witted guy like you would be

379
00:28:36,837 --> 00:28:39,798
touched to get a call from his high school
friend and come out to see me.

380
00:28:40,757 --> 00:28:42,050
No one will pick up my calls now.

381
00:28:42,634 --> 00:28:45,929
Everyone is so selfish.
When I try to mention jade mats,

382
00:28:46,555 --> 00:28:48,182
they figure out it's a pyramid scheme.

383
00:28:48,265 --> 00:28:49,349
A pyramid scheme?

384
00:28:51,727 --> 00:28:53,353
But thanks for calling me.

385
00:28:53,437 --> 00:28:55,397
It's nice to see a friendly face.

386
00:28:55,481 --> 00:28:56,648
Friendly face?

387
00:28:56,732 --> 00:28:59,151
I'm just taking advantage of you
because you're easy.

388
00:28:59,276 --> 00:29:00,194
Think about it.

389
00:29:00,486 --> 00:29:04,156
In high school, you were always
stuck at a corner, looking depressed.

390
00:29:04,364 --> 00:29:05,824
You were a legendary outcast.

391
00:29:06,408 --> 00:29:07,951
I really hated you, too.

392
00:29:10,871 --> 00:29:12,623
Okay. I see.

393
00:29:15,834 --> 00:29:16,710
Hold on.

394
00:29:16,793 --> 00:29:18,212
What did I just say?

395
00:29:19,046 --> 00:29:20,547
Gosh, I'm losing my shit.

396
00:29:21,131 --> 00:29:22,758
Hey, I'm leaving.

397
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,677
Damn it. He was my last customer.

398
00:29:54,915 --> 00:29:57,793
SHARE YOUR TRUE FEELINGS
AND FORGE A BEAUTIFUL RELATIONSHIP

399
00:29:59,253 --> 00:30:00,337
<i>True feelings?</i>

400
00:30:01,588 --> 00:30:03,799
<i>Will those true feelings
be only beautiful?</i>

401
00:30:06,343 --> 00:30:08,262
<i>Here's what I realized in my 27-year life.</i>

402
00:30:09,221 --> 00:30:11,598
<i>If you want to be
on good terms with other people,</i>

403
00:30:12,683 --> 00:30:14,351
<i>it's better to be in the dark</i>

404
00:30:16,019 --> 00:30:17,729
<i>about other people's feelings.</i>

405
00:30:21,191 --> 00:30:22,985
You jerks!

406
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:26,113
Stop. I told you to stop!

407
00:30:26,363 --> 00:30:28,574
Damn it. Shit.

408
00:30:29,241 --> 00:30:32,661
Now, even the taxi drivers
are ignoring me.

409
00:30:33,829 --> 00:30:34,663
Fine.

410
00:30:35,664 --> 00:30:37,207
You must think

411
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:41,628
I'm a joke because all I do
is smile like a fool.

412
00:30:42,671 --> 00:30:43,714
Shit!

413
00:30:44,923 --> 00:30:45,799
You!

414
00:30:48,468 --> 00:30:49,845
Asshole.

415
00:30:51,263 --> 00:30:52,889
I'm going to kill you!

416
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:00,314
Damn it.

417
00:31:03,233 --> 00:31:04,610
<i>Everyone, try a sample.</i>

418
00:31:04,693 --> 00:31:08,822
We got this from Jeju Island just now.
Jeju pork is on sale today!

419
00:31:09,197 --> 00:31:11,199
Please try a sample.

420
00:31:11,283 --> 00:31:12,993
Please try it.

421
00:31:13,577 --> 00:31:15,162
The pork is very delicious.

422
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:21,376
The sample is always delicious.
It's nice and salty.

423
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:23,003
Right. This is from Jeju Island.

424
00:31:23,086 --> 00:31:24,963
The pigs only ate green tea,
so the gamey odor--

425
00:31:25,047 --> 00:31:27,132
Stop talking.
Just pick up the speed and grill.

426
00:31:27,215 --> 00:31:29,009
You're pretty slow.

427
00:31:30,636 --> 00:31:31,970
I'm sorry.

428
00:31:33,972 --> 00:31:35,932
You're so slow. That's not how you do it.

429
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:38,810
Let me see. Which one is cooked?

430
00:31:39,936 --> 00:31:41,188
Let's make three layers of meat.

431
00:31:41,271 --> 00:31:43,649
Sir, you must give back the tongs.

432
00:31:43,732 --> 00:31:46,443
Get off me.
Don't stop me from your sample.

433
00:31:46,526 --> 00:31:48,153
You're slow and dense.

434
00:31:48,236 --> 00:31:50,072
This is why you grill meat
at a place like this.

435
00:31:50,822 --> 00:31:51,782
Seriously.

436
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:10,592
What is "a place like this"?

437
00:32:11,259 --> 00:32:13,762
-What?
-This is my place of work.

438
00:32:13,845 --> 00:32:15,472
Those are my tongs. Give back.

439
00:32:16,181 --> 00:32:18,725
-Have you gone mad?
-Give back my tongs!

440
00:32:18,809 --> 00:32:19,976
-Give back my tongs!
-Gosh.

441
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,687
-Look at her.
-Gosh.

442
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:23,522
My goodness. What's wrong with you?

443
00:32:25,524 --> 00:32:27,359
-Give them back!
-Gosh.

444
00:32:27,442 --> 00:32:28,402
Get off me!

445
00:32:29,528 --> 00:32:31,196
-Are you okay?
-Oh, no.

446
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:33,740
-Is she okay?
-Shouldn't we call security?

447
00:32:37,619 --> 00:32:39,621
-What are you doing? What?
-Take that!

448
00:32:45,502 --> 00:32:47,504
Hey, take the tongs. Fine.

449
00:32:48,505 --> 00:32:50,966
Do you even earn one million won
with this job?

450
00:32:51,216 --> 00:32:54,594
Seriously. Those born of lowly status
make it obvious about their place.

451
00:32:54,803 --> 00:32:57,013
I bet you didn't study hard
when you were in school.

452
00:32:57,097 --> 00:32:59,599
And now that you're getting old,
you're grilling meat here.

453
00:32:59,683 --> 00:33:01,143
All you've got is your nasty temper.

454
00:33:01,226 --> 00:33:03,311
You ought to know your place.
How dare you?

455
00:33:03,395 --> 00:33:04,771
Do you even know who I am?

456
00:33:16,116 --> 00:33:17,409
Gosh.

457
00:33:22,789 --> 00:33:25,208
You're the one
with a lowly status and vulgar mouth.

458
00:33:25,292 --> 00:33:28,336
You are no more than a beggar who wants to
fill his stomach with free food.

459
00:33:28,754 --> 00:33:29,671
No.

460
00:33:29,755 --> 00:33:32,507
At least, beggars show respect
to those who feed him.

461
00:33:32,591 --> 00:33:35,510
How dare you disrespect her
when you're mooching off her samples?

462
00:33:35,594 --> 00:33:38,096
You're no better than a beggar.

463
00:33:45,645 --> 00:33:47,063
-Goodness.
-What was that?

464
00:33:47,397 --> 00:33:49,733
-Is he okay?
-Oh, my gosh.

465
00:33:49,816 --> 00:33:52,569
-It looks like he's hurt.
-This is awful.

466
00:33:58,533 --> 00:33:59,868
-Are you okay?
-Are you all right?

467
00:34:00,577 --> 00:34:02,162
-Oh, no.
-What happened?

468
00:34:02,245 --> 00:34:04,289
-I think he's hurt.
-Gosh.

469
00:34:04,372 --> 00:34:06,875
Why are there so many lunatics
at this supermarket?

470
00:34:06,958 --> 00:34:09,294
Get me your supervisor.
I want your supervisor!

471
00:34:09,377 --> 00:34:10,712
Yes, I'm here.

472
00:34:11,171 --> 00:34:12,214
I'm sorry, sir.

473
00:34:12,714 --> 00:34:14,966
It seems
we've poorly trained our employees.

474
00:34:16,092 --> 00:34:19,137
Ms. Song, because a few people
complimented on your work,

475
00:34:19,221 --> 00:34:21,014
you have misjudged your place.

476
00:34:21,556 --> 00:34:22,641
Do you want to get fired?

477
00:34:23,225 --> 00:34:25,393
Kneel and apologize to him right now.

478
00:34:25,894 --> 00:34:26,728
Sir.

479
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:30,524
The customer used
inappropriate language as well.

480
00:34:30,607 --> 00:34:32,901
I think they should both
apologize to each other.

481
00:34:32,984 --> 00:34:34,110
Why are you butting in now?

482
00:34:34,736 --> 00:34:36,780
You're a contract worker. Know your place.

483
00:34:39,533 --> 00:34:41,993
Mi-ran, kneel right now.

484
00:34:46,248 --> 00:34:48,667
-What?
-That lunatic.

485
00:34:50,126 --> 00:34:51,419
How will you compensate for this?

486
00:34:51,503 --> 00:34:53,296
Sir, we will take
full responsibility for it.

487
00:34:57,926 --> 00:35:02,097
Why stop there? Why don't you just tell
people that you're a 500-year-old ghost?

488
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:04,015
Why don't we put up a banner here?

489
00:35:04,099 --> 00:35:06,685
I lost my temper in the heat
of the moment. I let him go, though.

490
00:35:06,768 --> 00:35:09,187
Seriously. Why did you lose your temper?

491
00:35:09,271 --> 00:35:12,148
Some people might think
you're a vigilante or whatnot.

492
00:35:12,649 --> 00:35:14,401
You said you hated the entire human race

493
00:35:14,484 --> 00:35:16,027
and didn't want to talk to them.

494
00:35:16,444 --> 00:35:17,362
Yes. I don't want to.

495
00:35:17,445 --> 00:35:20,323
I hate every human being,
but I especially hated that jerk. So what?

496
00:35:23,743 --> 00:35:25,161
Here's what I think.

497
00:35:26,454 --> 00:35:28,206
I don't think you hate people.

498
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:30,959
From a very long time ago,

499
00:35:31,042 --> 00:35:34,087
something has been lurking
around deep down in your heart.

500
00:35:35,547 --> 00:35:36,590
How should I put it?

501
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,468
It's...

502
00:35:44,139 --> 00:35:48,059
You were born with a nasty temper.
Your temper is beyond repair.

503
00:35:48,143 --> 00:35:51,438
You just have one heck of a nasty temper.
That's it.

504
00:35:51,521 --> 00:35:52,939
What? You jerk.

505
00:35:53,023 --> 00:35:55,567
Hey, where are you going?
Aren't you going to work?

506
00:35:56,359 --> 00:35:57,986
The higher-ups are on my ass. So are you.

507
00:35:58,069 --> 00:35:59,821
Let me go out and de-stress.

508
00:36:01,656 --> 00:36:03,450
Darn it. Whatever.

509
00:36:29,434 --> 00:36:30,435
No!

510
00:36:37,275 --> 00:36:39,402
Hey, what's your problem? Are you crazy?

511
00:36:39,986 --> 00:36:41,613
If you want to die, die somewhere else.

512
00:36:41,696 --> 00:36:44,032
Are you trying to ruin my life? Damn you.

513
00:36:58,797 --> 00:37:01,883
I am sorry on multiple occasions today.

514
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:03,718
Get home safely.

515
00:37:03,802 --> 00:37:04,970
Do you

516
00:37:05,762 --> 00:37:08,682
have anyone waiting for you at home?
Like your family or a friend?

517
00:37:09,933 --> 00:37:10,809
No.

518
00:37:15,355 --> 00:37:18,274
Then, do you want to get something to eat?
I'm hungry.

519
00:37:45,427 --> 00:37:48,430
I don't give out
this special <i>ssamjang</i> to anyone.

520
00:37:50,515 --> 00:37:51,391
Try it.

521
00:37:58,481 --> 00:37:59,524
It's good.

522
00:38:02,736 --> 00:38:03,945
Isn't life so shitty?

523
00:38:07,407 --> 00:38:08,324
No, it's okay.

524
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:11,244
I'm not the only one struggling.
It's the same for everyone.

525
00:38:11,828 --> 00:38:12,746
That's right.

526
00:38:13,413 --> 00:38:14,622
Everyone struggles.

527
00:38:15,123 --> 00:38:16,416
But that doesn't mean

528
00:38:17,292 --> 00:38:18,835
everyone jumps in front of a truck.

529
00:38:19,335 --> 00:38:22,338
Oh, that. I was preoccupied, so I didn't--

530
00:38:22,422 --> 00:38:23,757
You have shitty customers.

531
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,842
They curse at you and go on a power trip.

532
00:38:25,925 --> 00:38:28,261
Aren't you pissed? Upset?
I'll resolve all of your worries--

533
00:38:28,344 --> 00:38:29,179
No.

534
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:31,097
I can put up with that.

535
00:38:33,516 --> 00:38:35,477
No? That's not the cause?

536
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:38,021
Then, why did you jump
in front of a truck to kill yourself?

537
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:41,983
It's nothing.

538
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:46,905
She's driving me mad.

539
00:38:47,405 --> 00:38:49,908
How many times must I ask her to vent?

540
00:38:51,993 --> 00:38:54,079
Mi-ran, I'm sorry for making you wait.

541
00:38:55,747 --> 00:38:58,750
Aren't you the lady
from the supermarket earlier?

542
00:38:58,833 --> 00:39:01,377
Yes, I'm that lady. Why do you ask?

543
00:39:03,171 --> 00:39:05,006
Thank you. You were awesome.

544
00:39:06,716 --> 00:39:08,510
Where did you go?

545
00:39:08,635 --> 00:39:09,636
Oh, this.

546
00:39:10,386 --> 00:39:13,556
The tongs must have scratched
your chin earlier.

547
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,016
You should put on some ointment.

548
00:39:16,392 --> 00:39:19,687
Thank you. I should be
the one buying you medicine.

549
00:39:20,146 --> 00:39:21,564
I hurt your face.

550
00:39:21,689 --> 00:39:23,191
My gosh, I'm fine.

551
00:39:23,274 --> 00:39:25,610
No, I don't think so. Let me see.

552
00:39:32,826 --> 00:39:36,162
I jumped in front of the truck earlier
because of Mr. Park.

553
00:39:38,206 --> 00:39:39,833
-Pardon?
-All of a sudden?

554
00:39:39,916 --> 00:39:41,084
You said it was nothing.

555
00:39:41,918 --> 00:39:45,380
If you have some time,
will you listen to my story?

556
00:39:49,092 --> 00:39:52,387
Sure. I have a lot of time.
I can listen to you.

557
00:39:59,519 --> 00:40:02,355
-Have a piece. It's a limited time offer!
<i>-As you know,</i>

558
00:40:02,438 --> 00:40:05,066
<i>-I started as a contract worker.</i>
-Ma'am, try one, please.

559
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:07,277
-<i>To switch to a permanent position,</i>
-Thank you.

560
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:12,240
<i>I put up with countless customers
who were rude to me.</i>

561
00:40:12,699 --> 00:40:13,616
<i>But...</i>

562
00:40:16,369 --> 00:40:18,371
Congrats on winning
the kind employee of the month.

563
00:40:18,955 --> 00:40:20,123
Thank you.

564
00:40:20,582 --> 00:40:22,041
I have you to thank for.

565
00:40:23,168 --> 00:40:24,544
So you know.

566
00:40:26,045 --> 00:40:26,880
Pardon?

567
00:40:26,963 --> 00:40:30,008
I know a lot about you, Mi-ran.

568
00:40:31,801 --> 00:40:33,052
About a few things

569
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:35,638
here and there.

570
00:40:37,348 --> 00:40:41,352
Right. Mi-ran, your parents passed away.

571
00:40:41,644 --> 00:40:43,104
Your sibling is retaking the CSAT.

572
00:40:45,732 --> 00:40:47,692
You must switch to a permanent position

573
00:40:47,775 --> 00:40:49,485
as soon as you can
to support your sibling.

574
00:40:49,569 --> 00:40:50,612
Right?

575
00:40:51,529 --> 00:40:52,739
Yes.

576
00:40:54,073 --> 00:40:59,537
Then, you should keep a nice reputation
like this for a few more months. Okay?

577
00:41:00,914 --> 00:41:04,000
Once you do that, I'll switch you
to a permanent position.

578
00:41:05,376 --> 00:41:07,420
Don't you know that I have

579
00:41:08,755 --> 00:41:10,256
the deciding power?

580
00:41:11,466 --> 00:41:12,759
<i>So</i>

581
00:41:13,843 --> 00:41:16,012
<i>you should be nice to me, too.</i>

582
00:41:16,638 --> 00:41:18,806
<i>-Okay?
-What are you doing?</i>

583
00:41:19,182 --> 00:41:20,308
<i>Don't say stuff like that.</i>

584
00:41:20,892 --> 00:41:23,269
<i>People might think
I'm violating you or something.</i>

585
00:41:24,354 --> 00:41:27,982
<i>You just remind me of my younger sister.</i>

586
00:41:28,149 --> 00:41:29,567
<i>I adore you. That's all.</i>

587
00:41:31,694 --> 00:41:32,946
-Enjoy your meal.
-Hi.

588
00:41:35,949 --> 00:41:37,325
Oh, my.

589
00:41:38,993 --> 00:41:39,994
Where...

590
00:41:45,792 --> 00:41:47,543
<i>My life was like a living hell.</i>

591
00:41:49,921 --> 00:41:52,215
<i>I tried my best to bear it,
but once I got home,</i>

592
00:41:52,298 --> 00:41:54,509
<i>I exploded with anger.
I couldn't control it.</i>

593
00:41:55,969 --> 00:41:57,512
<i>But this made me feel more miserable.</i>

594
00:41:58,513 --> 00:42:01,015
<i>-The next day morning,</i>
-Try a sample.

595
00:42:01,099 --> 00:42:02,809
<i>-I had to go to work</i>
-The pigs had green tea,

596
00:42:02,892 --> 00:42:04,602
<i>-with a smile on my face.</i>
-so it's so tender.

597
00:42:05,061 --> 00:42:06,604
-Isn't it good?
<i>-I had to make a living.</i>

598
00:42:06,688 --> 00:42:09,315
-Thank you. Try a sample.
<i>-That bastard.</i>

599
00:42:09,399 --> 00:42:12,277
What? His younger sister? He adores you?

600
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,904
Why are there so many crazy jerks
in the world?

601
00:42:15,446 --> 00:42:17,824
-I ought to--
-I ought to pull out

602
00:42:19,575 --> 00:42:21,119
his tongue. Damn him.

603
00:42:21,953 --> 00:42:23,538
That fucker.

604
00:42:25,248 --> 00:42:27,834
Anyway, those who abuse their power
over someone's job

605
00:42:27,917 --> 00:42:30,378
and taking advantage of your weak spot
are the dirtiest of all.

606
00:42:30,753 --> 00:42:32,255
So what do you want to do?

607
00:42:33,089 --> 00:42:35,258
-What?
-What do you want to do with him?

608
00:42:35,842 --> 00:42:37,593
I don't want to take any actions.

609
00:42:38,261 --> 00:42:40,346
I just want him to know

610
00:42:41,472 --> 00:42:44,517
how it feels to be cornered,
with his backs against the wall.

611
00:42:48,855 --> 00:42:50,648
Hey, go out and turn right.

612
00:42:52,525 --> 00:42:53,484
Pardon?

613
00:42:53,568 --> 00:42:55,570
Go out and turn right.
And you'll see the restroom.

614
00:42:55,653 --> 00:42:58,406
Go wash up.
I need to talk to her in private.

615
00:43:00,199 --> 00:43:01,326
Wait.

616
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:04,370
Take this and sober up.

617
00:43:04,454 --> 00:43:05,413
What?

618
00:43:15,423 --> 00:43:17,675
I'll leave you two to it.

619
00:43:22,889 --> 00:43:26,184
You want him to experience how it feels
to be cornered with no ways to turn.

620
00:43:27,185 --> 00:43:29,229
Okay, I got it.

621
00:43:31,105 --> 00:43:32,690
On that note, let's drink up.

622
00:43:33,441 --> 00:43:36,569
I don't usually share
this drink with anyone.

623
00:43:39,322 --> 00:43:40,365
Bottoms up.

624
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:41,741
Thank you.

625
00:43:57,173 --> 00:43:59,467
Why am I so sleepy all of a sudden?

626
00:44:05,348 --> 00:44:07,600
DREAM WORLD: MI-RAN'S DREAM

627
00:44:54,355 --> 00:44:55,481
Mi-ran.

628
00:44:56,357 --> 00:44:59,610
Everyone is gone. Are you still working?

629
00:45:01,529 --> 00:45:04,240
No, I was waiting for you.

630
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:06,325
What a surprise.

631
00:45:06,909 --> 00:45:09,495
I like this feisty side of you today.

632
00:45:14,876 --> 00:45:17,879
Do you like it?
Should I dial it up a notch?

633
00:45:21,632 --> 00:45:22,842
Who are you?

634
00:45:22,925 --> 00:45:24,177
Who do you think?

635
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:27,054
I'm Weol-ju from Mystic Pop-up Bar.

636
00:46:07,553 --> 00:46:08,554
Why is she...

637
00:46:11,849 --> 00:46:12,767
Damn it.

638
00:46:29,742 --> 00:46:31,077
Damn it.

639
00:46:32,578 --> 00:46:35,456
Don't come near me.
If you do, I'll kill you.

640
00:46:41,254 --> 00:46:43,130
MYSTIC POP-UP BAR

641
00:46:51,847 --> 00:46:52,974
What is that?

642
00:46:53,641 --> 00:46:54,934
Did I drink too much?

643
00:47:07,321 --> 00:47:08,698
Where did the owner go?

644
00:47:12,034 --> 00:47:14,829
Mi-ran, wake up. Let's get you home.

645
00:47:17,873 --> 00:47:19,125
Mi-ran.

646
00:47:25,298 --> 00:47:27,758
Hey, go. Go!

647
00:47:28,634 --> 00:47:30,177
-Go away.
-What?

648
00:47:31,387 --> 00:47:32,430
Go away!

649
00:47:32,513 --> 00:47:33,389
You!

650
00:47:34,724 --> 00:47:35,850
-No.
-Go away.

651
00:47:37,643 --> 00:47:38,853
Hey. Darn it.

652
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:40,396
You!

653
00:47:44,817 --> 00:47:45,651
What should I do?

654
00:48:03,836 --> 00:48:05,504
Hey, what is this?

655
00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:07,423
What are you doing here?

656
00:48:07,506 --> 00:48:09,634
Exactly. Why am I here?

657
00:48:09,717 --> 00:48:12,428
I thought I entered the bar.

658
00:48:13,499 --> 00:48:15,626
Exactly. Why am I here?

659
00:48:15,716 --> 00:48:18,168
I thought I entered the bar.

660
00:48:18,254 --> 00:48:19,339
The pop-up bar?

661
00:48:20,173 --> 00:48:22,467
When you came back from the restroom,
you could see the bar?

662
00:48:23,176 --> 00:48:24,135
Yes.

663
00:48:24,219 --> 00:48:25,553
That can't be.

664
00:48:27,263 --> 00:48:29,724
Who the heck are you?
Did the Inspection Office send you?

665
00:48:29,808 --> 00:48:32,310
"Inspection Office"? I work at
the Customer Satisfaction Center.

666
00:48:32,394 --> 00:48:33,728
Give me a straight answer.

667
00:48:33,812 --> 00:48:35,563
A human cannot jump
into someone else's dream.

668
00:48:36,064 --> 00:48:38,191
What? I'm in someone's dream?

669
00:48:39,317 --> 00:48:40,193
Whose dream?

670
00:48:40,276 --> 00:48:41,778
The girl from earlier.

671
00:48:41,861 --> 00:48:43,363
What took you so long?

672
00:48:43,488 --> 00:48:47,992
I told you I needed to de-stress.
My gosh, I feel refreshed.

673
00:48:49,369 --> 00:48:50,620
-What's he doing?
-Wait.

674
00:48:51,162 --> 00:48:53,456
I'm in Mi-ran's dream?

675
00:48:54,624 --> 00:48:56,501
Then, what are you two doing here?

676
00:48:57,711 --> 00:48:58,712
Us?

677
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:01,423
Well,

678
00:49:01,506 --> 00:49:03,007
how should we put it?

679
00:49:03,842 --> 00:49:06,136
We make people's wishes come true

680
00:49:06,219 --> 00:49:07,846
and help them take revenge
in their dreams.

681
00:49:07,929 --> 00:49:09,055
That's what we do.

682
00:49:10,807 --> 00:49:12,100
To put it simply...

683
00:49:12,392 --> 00:49:13,393
Right. We're like spirits.

684
00:49:14,185 --> 00:49:18,565
We're somewhat similar to what they do.

685
00:49:18,773 --> 00:49:20,400
That's all you need to know.

686
00:49:20,483 --> 00:49:22,152
We solve problems in people's dreamland.

687
00:49:22,235 --> 00:49:24,529
We don't have time to explain that to him.

688
00:49:24,612 --> 00:49:26,698
A human has entered the Dream World.

689
00:49:26,781 --> 00:49:27,949
This is a huge mess.

690
00:49:37,625 --> 00:49:40,044
It's because his spiritual vision
is unlocked.

691
00:49:40,253 --> 00:49:42,297
What? What about me is unlocked?

692
00:49:43,757 --> 00:49:46,468
No way. He's not some kind of
a high priest or a grand shaman.

693
00:49:46,551 --> 00:49:47,677
Right.

694
00:49:47,761 --> 00:49:49,053
He seems to be a special case.

695
00:49:49,137 --> 00:49:51,264
His spiritual vision
wasn't locked at birth.

696
00:49:53,057 --> 00:49:55,018
Ever since you were young,
people complained

697
00:49:55,101 --> 00:49:56,895
and asked you for favors, didn't they?

698
00:49:57,771 --> 00:50:00,857
-Yes, that's right.
-So you think that's how he ended up here?

699
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:02,358
It's possible.

700
00:50:02,442 --> 00:50:06,279
He'll forget everything
once he wakes up, so don't worry.

701
00:50:06,362 --> 00:50:09,032
So I've been living this way
because of my spiritual vision?

702
00:50:11,201 --> 00:50:12,744
If you solve problems,

703
00:50:12,827 --> 00:50:14,496
can you even change
a person's temperament?

704
00:50:14,579 --> 00:50:17,624
Of course. Nothing is impossible for me.

705
00:50:17,707 --> 00:50:19,501
My gosh, that's amazing.

706
00:50:19,584 --> 00:50:21,085
Then can you help me--

707
00:50:21,169 --> 00:50:22,629
Hey, he's running away.

708
00:50:23,463 --> 00:50:24,672
Catch him!

709
00:50:59,123 --> 00:51:01,751
Please forgive me. I'm sorry.

710
00:51:01,835 --> 00:51:04,462
This is why I love my job.

711
00:51:04,546 --> 00:51:07,549
Some jerks think they're above others.

712
00:51:07,632 --> 00:51:11,135
And some jerks even mess around
with other people's jobs.

713
00:51:11,219 --> 00:51:14,764
It's exhilarating to see jerks like you
shiver with fear.

714
00:51:16,015 --> 00:51:18,768
Please forgive me just this once.

715
00:51:20,770 --> 00:51:23,690
How does it feel to be cornered
with your back against the wall?

716
00:51:24,274 --> 00:51:27,485
Someone even tried to kill herself today
because of you. Do you know that?

717
00:51:27,652 --> 00:51:32,407
You're not just a horrible boss.
You destroy people's spirits.

718
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:33,825
Get off me!

719
00:51:35,034 --> 00:51:36,452
Let me go!

720
00:51:37,203 --> 00:51:38,496
That darn punk.

721
00:51:44,168 --> 00:51:45,086
Should I throw him?

722
00:51:45,169 --> 00:51:47,964
You know the answer. Throw him!

723
00:51:50,049 --> 00:51:51,092
Please.

724
00:51:51,593 --> 00:51:53,511
I swear I'll be kind from now on.

725
00:51:53,595 --> 00:51:57,140
Okay, I'll forgive you just this once
since I'm in a good mood today.

726
00:51:57,515 --> 00:51:59,601
So I really hope you better yourself.

727
00:52:01,686 --> 00:52:04,230
Don't cry. Why are you crying?

728
00:52:05,857 --> 00:52:06,983
Oh, my goodness.

729
00:52:08,443 --> 00:52:10,028
Gosh, you're disgusting.

730
00:52:15,783 --> 00:52:18,703
<i>Did Mr. Park really fall off the rooftop?</i>

731
00:52:18,786 --> 00:52:20,496
<i>Lucky him. He'll grow taller.</i>

732
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:26,336
Don't come inside.

733
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:28,630
You can't see this.

734
00:52:29,672 --> 00:52:31,716
Mi-ran, come outside. It's okay now.

735
00:52:38,556 --> 00:52:40,099
She locked the door.

736
00:52:40,683 --> 00:52:43,144
She locked the door? Why? What's in there?

737
00:52:43,227 --> 00:52:45,188
That's the CCTV Control Room.

738
00:52:45,688 --> 00:52:48,775
The monitors are busy
playing her past memories right now.

739
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:53,863
Mi-ran, are you a fool?

740
00:52:54,572 --> 00:52:56,324
Are you scared that someone might watch?

741
00:52:56,407 --> 00:52:57,492
Are you embarrassed?

742
00:52:58,034 --> 00:53:01,204
Why would you feel that way?
You did nothing wrong.

743
00:53:01,454 --> 00:53:03,247
You're a victim, not an offender.

744
00:53:05,208 --> 00:53:06,417
Hurry up and come outside.

745
00:53:06,501 --> 00:53:10,296
Come outside
and show those footage to Mr. Park.

746
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:12,799
The bad guy should be the one
who's scared and embarrassed.

747
00:53:16,970 --> 00:53:18,262
Don't be afraid.

748
00:53:19,305 --> 00:53:22,809
You saw how they punished Mr. Park
on the rooftop, right?

749
00:53:23,685 --> 00:53:25,979
Do you know he got scared
and peed on himself?

750
00:53:26,062 --> 00:53:26,938
It was totally crazy.

751
00:53:30,775 --> 00:53:31,651
You just laughed.

752
00:53:32,485 --> 00:53:33,486
It's funny, isn't it?

753
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:38,116
But unfortunately,

754
00:53:39,283 --> 00:53:41,035
this is just a dream.

755
00:53:41,995 --> 00:53:43,496
Once you wake up,

756
00:53:44,122 --> 00:53:45,540
you'll have to punish him yourself.

757
00:53:53,548 --> 00:53:54,716
Hey, forget it. That's enough.

758
00:53:56,050 --> 00:53:57,885
Hey, just stay in there.

759
00:53:57,969 --> 00:54:01,347
Live the rest of your life
getting bullied by people like Mr. Park.

760
00:54:01,639 --> 00:54:04,684
It was completely useless
to take revenge for her.

761
00:54:05,101 --> 00:54:07,228
You really didn't deserve any of this.

762
00:54:08,855 --> 00:54:12,233
My gosh, you have such a bad temper.
Let's go. Come on.

763
00:54:12,316 --> 00:54:13,985
-Let me go.
-Let's go.

764
00:54:14,068 --> 00:54:15,862
Gosh, what's with you? Get off.

765
00:54:17,071 --> 00:54:18,281
There she is.

766
00:54:18,990 --> 00:54:19,866
I'm sorry.

767
00:54:19,949 --> 00:54:22,160
You still haven't gotten to your senses.

768
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:24,620
Who told you to be sorry? Don't be sorry!

769
00:54:25,955 --> 00:54:27,999
What's the name of the bar
you drank today?

770
00:54:29,167 --> 00:54:30,209
Pardon?

771
00:54:30,293 --> 00:54:31,919
It's Mystic Pop-up Bar.

772
00:54:32,003 --> 00:54:33,629
And when you drink at our bar,

773
00:54:33,713 --> 00:54:35,882
you become a boss.

774
00:54:35,965 --> 00:54:37,258
That's what we both are.

775
00:54:38,092 --> 00:54:41,262
Why would you succumb to him?
You should be cursing at him right now.

776
00:54:41,554 --> 00:54:45,641
Act like you have claws
and growl even if you don't have fangs.

777
00:54:45,767 --> 00:54:46,601
You got that?

778
00:54:49,270 --> 00:54:50,146
Okay.

779
00:54:51,564 --> 00:54:53,024
Okay, I got it.

780
00:54:54,067 --> 00:54:56,819
I'll do that.
I'll live like that from now on.

781
00:55:27,725 --> 00:55:29,185
When did I come home?

782
00:55:34,398 --> 00:55:35,566
I must've drank too much.

783
00:55:44,909 --> 00:55:45,952
It's indisputable.

784
00:55:46,035 --> 00:55:49,080
Not only will he be disciplined for this,
but you can even file a criminal suit.

785
00:55:53,918 --> 00:55:54,961
Thank you.

786
00:55:55,503 --> 00:55:58,923
I bet it wasn't easy to tell me this.
Thank you for being so brave.

787
00:56:05,012 --> 00:56:06,430
Excuse me.

788
00:56:07,557 --> 00:56:09,809
I'm sorry about yesterday.
I'll pay for the hospital--

789
00:56:09,892 --> 00:56:12,562
No, it's okay. I didn't even get hurt.

790
00:56:12,979 --> 00:56:16,649
I thought about what I did,
and I shouldn't have acted that way.

791
00:56:17,817 --> 00:56:18,693
Pardon?

792
00:56:18,776 --> 00:56:21,487
I'm sorry. I really shouldn't have
treated you that way.

793
00:56:24,365 --> 00:56:26,117
Please forgive me. I'm really sorry.

794
00:56:26,826 --> 00:56:28,286
Oh, okay.

795
00:56:36,252 --> 00:56:37,378
Oh, gosh.

796
00:56:37,962 --> 00:56:38,963
Who are you?

797
00:56:39,046 --> 00:56:39,922
Me?

798
00:56:40,464 --> 00:56:41,507
Well...

799
00:56:41,924 --> 00:56:44,677
How should I put it? A fairy, I guess?

800
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:47,471
-A meat fairy.
-What?

801
00:56:47,555 --> 00:56:50,224
I know you like meat. Here.

802
00:56:50,933 --> 00:56:52,685
Eat up while you can

803
00:56:52,768 --> 00:56:56,105
instead of causing a scene
at the supermarket.

804
00:56:57,106 --> 00:57:00,026
Repeat after me. "I will eat at home.

805
00:57:00,193 --> 00:57:01,986
The supermarket is only for samples."

806
00:57:02,069 --> 00:57:03,654
"I will eat at home."

807
00:57:03,738 --> 00:57:04,614
Say it properly.

808
00:57:06,866 --> 00:57:07,867
Gosh, it's hot.

809
00:57:08,326 --> 00:57:10,536
"I will eat at home.
The supermarket is only for samples."

810
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:13,206
If you cause another scene,
you'll have to talk to a crazy...

811
00:57:13,789 --> 00:57:16,792
I mean, you'll have to talk
to a very serious lady.

812
00:57:16,876 --> 00:57:18,878
So keep that in mind, okay?

813
00:57:19,045 --> 00:57:19,879
Okay.

814
00:57:33,351 --> 00:57:36,729
No one has ever apologized to me before.

815
00:57:43,194 --> 00:57:44,695
Mi-ran, what's wrong?

816
00:57:45,988 --> 00:57:49,575
No, nothing's wrong.
By the way, I'm sorry about last night.

817
00:57:49,825 --> 00:57:52,745
I got too drunk, didn't I?
Thank you for safely taking me home.

818
00:57:53,329 --> 00:57:55,164
What? I took you home?

819
00:57:55,248 --> 00:57:56,749
Didn't you take me home?

820
00:57:58,584 --> 00:58:00,836
I'm not sure. I blacked out as well.

821
00:58:01,545 --> 00:58:04,131
But it kind of feels like
something interesting happened last night.

822
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:08,302
Really? I only remember
eating grilled pork at the pop-up bar.

823
00:58:08,844 --> 00:58:10,304
And maybe it's because I ate well,

824
00:58:10,388 --> 00:58:13,641
but for some reason,
I woke up today feeling very refreshed.

825
00:58:13,724 --> 00:58:15,601
-Let's have a great day.
-Yes.

826
00:58:39,333 --> 00:58:40,167
What?

827
00:58:41,294 --> 00:58:42,420
I think it was real.

828
00:58:44,964 --> 00:58:47,675
No, that's impossible.
Maybe it was a dream.

829
00:59:02,481 --> 00:59:04,900
It was real. It actually happened.
It wasn't a dream.

830
00:59:05,484 --> 00:59:08,654
No, wait. If it was real,
then Mr. Park should be dead.

831
00:59:10,448 --> 00:59:12,992
Does that mean
I actually went inside Mi-ran's dream?

832
00:59:15,953 --> 00:59:17,788
Gosh, that's totally absurd.

833
00:59:17,872 --> 00:59:18,998
But what about this <i>binyeo</i>?

834
00:59:34,555 --> 00:59:36,432
Why the chopstick? Where's your <i>binyeo</i>?

835
00:59:37,266 --> 00:59:40,519
I left it on the rooftop yesterday.
I should go get it later.

836
00:59:42,396 --> 00:59:46,067
We finally made some progress,
so let's drink to congratulate.

837
00:59:46,150 --> 00:59:47,360
Cheers.

838
00:59:49,570 --> 00:59:50,988
Yeombujang, what brings you here?

839
00:59:51,072 --> 00:59:53,366
It's okay. Sit down.

840
00:59:54,033 --> 00:59:55,534
Oh, you didn't even bother to get up.

841
00:59:56,118 --> 00:59:57,828
What are you going to nag about this time?

842
00:59:57,912 --> 01:00:00,956
What are you wearing?
Is it made out of a mosquito net?

843
01:00:02,124 --> 01:00:05,336
As you can see,
we're having a party right now.

844
01:00:05,419 --> 01:00:07,088
I'm celebrating my achievement,

845
01:00:07,171 --> 01:00:10,716
so I figured I should wear
something fitting for the occasion.

846
01:00:13,427 --> 01:00:15,054
It's no time for a party.

847
01:00:15,137 --> 01:00:17,098
I'm here with Yeomradaewang's message.

848
01:00:17,681 --> 01:00:18,974
She sends way too many messages.

849
01:00:19,558 --> 01:00:20,726
What is it this time?

850
01:00:21,852 --> 01:00:23,145
Just wait.

851
01:00:27,441 --> 01:00:28,734
Hear me, Weol-ju.

852
01:00:29,693 --> 01:00:31,278
I extended your atonement period

853
01:00:31,654 --> 01:00:34,365
due to your virtuous acts
in your past life.

854
01:00:34,907 --> 01:00:37,535
But that can no longer continue.
I'll give you just one month.

855
01:00:37,868 --> 01:00:40,746
If you can't settle the grudges
of 100,000 people in that time,

856
01:00:41,622 --> 01:00:44,166
you will perish in the depths of hell.

857
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:45,751
So keep that in mind.

858
01:00:48,254 --> 01:00:49,255
The end.

859
01:00:50,798 --> 01:00:54,552
What? One month? What's this nonsense?

860
01:00:55,177 --> 01:00:58,973
Let's see. How long has it been
since you last made progress? Four months?

861
01:00:59,056 --> 01:01:00,808
No, six months.

862
01:01:00,975 --> 01:01:02,560
Good going.

863
01:01:02,643 --> 01:01:05,938
I sent you here to supervise her,
but you're slacking off together?

864
01:01:06,021 --> 01:01:07,982
Look. Take a look at this.

865
01:01:09,358 --> 01:01:10,776
MYSTIC POP-UP BAR PERFORMANCE GRAPH

866
01:01:10,901 --> 01:01:13,154
Yeomradaewang has been getting
so many complaints

867
01:01:13,237 --> 01:01:14,822
from the judges, so you're done.

868
01:01:14,905 --> 01:01:16,031
Complaints about what?

869
01:01:17,616 --> 01:01:20,244
"All she ever does in the Living Realm
is to drink alcohol and eat.

870
01:01:20,327 --> 01:01:21,996
How can you call this a punishment?

871
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:24,832
Stop wasting our time and resources
and send her to hell right now."

872
01:01:24,915 --> 01:01:26,417
That's what they keep saying.

873
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:28,335
But that's not--

874
01:01:28,419 --> 01:01:29,378
So what?

875
01:01:30,463 --> 01:01:32,756
So she's going to send me to hell?

876
01:01:35,176 --> 01:01:37,553
You know what? Tell her to go ahead.

877
01:01:37,636 --> 01:01:40,306
I worked my ass off for 500 years.

878
01:01:40,389 --> 01:01:43,267
And she's going to send me to hell
just because I'm short on a few people?

879
01:01:44,101 --> 01:01:47,229
I feel like an intern
who's been slaving away.

880
01:01:47,646 --> 01:01:48,856
-Hey.
-What?

881
01:01:48,939 --> 01:01:51,317
This is an abuse of authority.
It's so fucked up.

882
01:01:51,484 --> 01:01:54,528
I'm sick of this shit.
I'll just go to hell, okay?

883
01:01:54,612 --> 01:01:56,697
Go ahead and take me right now. Let's go.

884
01:01:56,780 --> 01:01:58,824
-Hey, come on.
-Don't even try. Move.

885
01:01:58,949 --> 01:02:00,576
-Gosh, calm down.
-What's wrong with you?

886
01:02:00,659 --> 01:02:02,286
Stop it. Hey, stay there.

887
01:02:02,369 --> 01:02:03,662
-What's your problem?
-Hey!

888
01:02:03,746 --> 01:02:06,165
-Hey!
-You! Who are you calling "Hey"?

889
01:02:07,666 --> 01:02:10,669
And what's with your darn temper?

890
01:02:10,753 --> 01:02:13,422
It's because you're taking way too long.

891
01:02:14,006 --> 01:02:17,218
The term of punishment for the dead
normally ends after 300 years.

892
01:02:17,301 --> 01:02:21,388
But you kept asking for an extension,
so she gave you 500 years instead.

893
01:02:22,139 --> 01:02:23,015
What?

894
01:02:23,641 --> 01:02:25,684
You're glaring at me again.
Are you going to hit me?

895
01:02:29,230 --> 01:02:33,025
Anyway, try to do a better job.
I'll be off now.

896
01:02:33,609 --> 01:02:35,569
-Good luck.
-Hey. No, wait.

897
01:02:36,028 --> 01:02:37,321
Yeombujang!

898
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:41,700
I feel like shit because of him.

899
01:02:47,456 --> 01:02:48,415
A month, was it?

900
01:02:48,499 --> 01:02:49,500
What?

901
01:02:50,417 --> 01:02:51,293
Yes.

902
01:02:52,253 --> 01:02:54,171
-Darn it!
-Hey!

903
01:03:07,601 --> 01:03:09,812
It wasn't a dream. It was real.

904
01:03:11,272 --> 01:03:12,940
A dream or reality?

905
01:03:14,233 --> 01:03:16,235
A dream or reality?

906
01:03:19,405 --> 01:03:20,614
If it was real...

907
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:22,825
If you solve problems,

908
01:03:22,908 --> 01:03:24,451
can you even change
a person's temperament?

909
01:03:24,535 --> 01:03:27,496
Of course. Nothing is impossible for me.

910
01:03:51,186 --> 01:03:52,396
Where are you going?

911
01:03:52,479 --> 01:03:55,941
I should give out free coupons.
What else can I do? I only have a month.

912
01:03:56,734 --> 01:03:57,943
Off to the bridge again?

913
01:03:58,277 --> 01:04:01,280
Yes. If I'm lucky, I'll meet someone
who's about to commit suicide.

914
01:04:02,615 --> 01:04:06,285
It'd be great if I have a magnet
that attracts sad people with grudges.

915
01:04:06,702 --> 01:04:08,746
That's impossible. There is no such thing.

916
01:04:13,042 --> 01:04:16,712
If you have some time,
will you listen to my story?

917
01:04:16,795 --> 01:04:18,380
Ever since you were young,

918
01:04:18,464 --> 01:04:20,883
people complained to you
and asked you for favors, didn't they?

919
01:04:20,966 --> 01:04:21,884
Yes, that's right.

920
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:23,761
I found it.

921
01:04:24,094 --> 01:04:25,137
Found what?

922
01:04:27,473 --> 01:04:29,391
-A magnet.
-What?

923
01:04:30,809 --> 01:04:32,645
I found myself a magnet.

924
01:04:33,729 --> 01:04:36,190
No, I shouldn't be here right now.

925
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:37,733
I'll see you!

926
01:05:05,469 --> 01:05:06,387
Ms. Weol-ju.

927
01:05:06,970 --> 01:05:08,472
Hey, Special Case.

928
01:05:09,515 --> 01:05:12,101
-Last night was real, wasn't it?
-What?

929
01:05:12,226 --> 01:05:14,812
You told me you're a spirit
who settles grudges.

930
01:05:15,145 --> 01:05:16,313
Can you help me, too?

931
01:05:16,397 --> 01:05:19,525
To me, you're my last hope.

932
01:05:21,318 --> 01:05:22,611
Okay.

933
01:05:23,445 --> 01:05:24,738
I'll be your last hope.

934
01:05:24,947 --> 01:05:28,117
I'll do everything I can to help you.

935
01:05:28,784 --> 01:05:30,244
Really?

936
01:05:30,327 --> 01:05:31,245
Yes.

937
01:05:31,954 --> 01:05:32,788
But instead,

938
01:05:34,039 --> 01:05:36,041
I want something in return.

939
01:05:36,667 --> 01:05:39,586
Yes, I actually brought it with me.
You were looking for this, weren't you?

940
01:05:40,587 --> 01:05:42,339
This was never yours, to begin with.

941
01:05:43,006 --> 01:05:44,133
Not this.

942
01:05:44,508 --> 01:05:47,219
That's not it? Then what is it?

943
01:05:47,302 --> 01:05:48,637
What do you think?

944
01:05:49,763 --> 01:05:50,764
Your body.

945
01:05:52,558 --> 01:05:54,935
I need your body.

946
01:06:00,858 --> 01:06:02,109

01:07:15,974 --> 01:07:17,226
