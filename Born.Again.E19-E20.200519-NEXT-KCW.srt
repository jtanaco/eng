1
00:00:07,255 --> 00:00:08,373
(Episode 19)

2
00:00:08,374 --> 00:00:10,975
Mr. John Doe came from the earth,

3
00:00:10,975 --> 00:00:12,377
so the earth will give us an answer,
wouldn't it?

4
00:00:12,422 --> 00:00:13,544
That's right.

5
00:00:14,925 --> 00:00:16,281
Let's get started.

6
00:00:16,748 --> 00:00:17,682
Scalpel.

7
00:00:31,486 --> 00:00:34,632
The eyelids should be deeper.

8
00:00:34,633 --> 00:00:36,532
- Deeper.
- Wait a minute.

9
00:00:36,533 --> 00:00:39,705
The skin should be thinner
on this side.

10
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:49,080
Deeper.

11
00:00:56,876 --> 00:00:59,190
Sa Bin, I'm going to
start mapping now.

12
00:01:06,142 --> 00:01:10,383
It's really tough to map someone
who I've never seen before.

13
00:01:10,385 --> 00:01:13,911
It's not just about the genes,
I have to use all my senses.

14
00:01:15,032 --> 00:01:18,043
Do you think we've never seen...

15
00:01:18,251 --> 00:01:19,454
this face before?

16
00:01:23,063 --> 00:01:26,751
Eyes that match those nose
and skin white as snow.

17
00:01:28,753 --> 00:01:30,989
How about his pupils?

18
00:01:31,127 --> 00:01:33,625
The iris that draws you in like
a black hole, right?

19
00:01:34,176 --> 00:01:35,579
- Okay.
- And...

20
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,454
as for the hair,

21
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:39,931
- we won't wear it back like this...
- Okay.

22
00:01:40,832 --> 00:01:41,800
but put it down like this.

23
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:43,737
- Put the hair down?
- Yes.

24
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:44,806
Okay.

25
00:01:47,906 --> 00:01:49,607
Let's do it again.

26
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:53,117
Put the hair down.

27
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,362
I think this man...

28
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:59,001
would've worn a uniform.

29
00:01:59,001 --> 00:02:00,103
A uniform?

30
00:02:00,853 --> 00:02:02,295
What are you talking about?

31
00:02:03,154 --> 00:02:04,681
He'd look so good...

32
00:02:05,218 --> 00:02:07,928
holding a walkie-talkie.

33
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:18,821
I feel like...

34
00:02:19,695 --> 00:02:21,743
I've seen him somewhere before.

35
00:02:28,179 --> 00:02:30,798
(Revenge: Getting even
with what you have suffered)

36
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:16,367
What is difficult for you...

37
00:03:20,478 --> 00:03:22,066
will be too easy...

38
00:03:23,212 --> 00:03:24,381
for someone.

39
00:03:59,635 --> 00:04:00,672
Please go inside.

40
00:04:02,555 --> 00:04:05,610
I'll be going now. Drive safe.

41
00:04:11,149 --> 00:04:12,207
Wait a minute.

42
00:04:20,103 --> 00:04:22,193
I can't send you
a wedding invitation...

43
00:04:24,227 --> 00:04:25,296
since I...

44
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:27,915
called the marriage off.

45
00:04:38,934 --> 00:04:40,002
His marriage is off?

46
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:42,614
Why?

47
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,468
Could it possibly be...

48
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:06,125
because of me?

49
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:09,173
- It's because of me?
- What is?

50
00:05:13,421 --> 00:05:16,547
I saw you guys on the way home.
What's that weird vibe...

51
00:05:16,548 --> 00:05:18,883
- between you and Prosecutor Kim?
- He is not...

52
00:05:19,359 --> 00:05:21,027
getting married.

53
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,263
He had a girlfriend?

54
00:05:22,687 --> 00:05:25,523
If you say it's because of you,
does it mean he likes you?

55
00:05:25,524 --> 00:05:27,492
Is it because of the experiment?

56
00:05:27,706 --> 00:05:30,042
So that experiment was...

57
00:05:30,451 --> 00:05:31,829
the problem.

58
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:34,899
Hey, take your medicine.

59
00:05:36,178 --> 00:05:38,837
Come on. Drink your water.

60
00:06:26,171 --> 00:06:28,052
Oh, gosh. What is this?

61
00:06:29,242 --> 00:06:32,423
Oh, my gosh! It's blood.

62
00:06:32,424 --> 00:06:34,058
It's blood everywhere!

63
00:06:34,774 --> 00:06:36,698
It's specially made.

64
00:06:37,028 --> 00:06:39,731
It's an arrowhead made
with titanium alloy.

65
00:06:40,288 --> 00:06:42,165
It's practically
a well-sharpened dagger.

66
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:45,436
Since he survived after being
stabbed 11 times with this,

67
00:06:45,437 --> 00:06:48,339
Detective Ju's lifeline must
be long indeed.

68
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:53,109
Did you get Detective Ju's phone?

69
00:06:53,111 --> 00:06:56,352
The memory chip has been shattered
so it'll take time to restore it.

70
00:06:56,354 --> 00:06:57,824
What about the CCTV near the post?

71
00:06:57,826 --> 00:07:00,985
There was no CCTV
since it's a residential area.

72
00:07:01,306 --> 00:07:04,336
There was video footage taken
by a car that's always parked there.

73
00:07:05,552 --> 00:07:07,501
Look at that perverted scumbag.

74
00:07:07,525 --> 00:07:09,160
Does he want to be found?

75
00:07:09,161 --> 00:07:11,529
Who entered the gallery before
and after the murder?

76
00:07:11,696 --> 00:07:14,799
A man was caught on camera
in front of Yuhon.

77
00:07:18,545 --> 00:07:19,767
Chun Jong Bum.

78
00:07:19,767 --> 00:07:22,740
His motorbike was caught on camera
from the street nearby.

79
00:07:22,935 --> 00:07:25,743
But he's also the one
who reported it.

80
00:07:28,018 --> 00:07:29,587
Then he's a strong suspect.

81
00:07:35,408 --> 00:07:37,877
He really likes going alone,
doesn't he?

82
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:40,118
(Yuhon Gallery)

83
00:07:49,555 --> 00:07:50,201
Yes.

84
00:07:50,202 --> 00:07:53,638
We got a written statement from a
witness in Chief Prosecutor's order.

85
00:07:53,905 --> 00:07:57,508
We looked into a car that chased
after Chun Jong Bum's bike.

86
00:07:57,688 --> 00:07:59,557
It is owned by Gang Du Chul.

87
00:07:59,911 --> 00:08:03,481
The funny thing is that the owner
of Yuhon is also Gang Du Chul.

88
00:08:03,938 --> 00:08:07,552
The statement says Jong Bum is
a fan of Gang Du Chul's paintings.

89
00:08:07,885 --> 00:08:09,954
It's fishy, isn't it?

90
00:08:10,621 --> 00:08:13,858
He offered a place to kill a man
and change the painting.

91
00:08:14,555 --> 00:08:15,993
I can see they are accomplices.

92
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:19,030
Look into Gang Du Chul.

93
00:08:25,508 --> 00:08:28,139
Detective Ju arrived at the gallery
at 9:20 p.m.

94
00:08:28,653 --> 00:08:31,876
Chun Jong Bum entered the gallery
at 9:27 p.m.

95
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:35,580
Detective texted me at 9:38 p.m.

96
00:08:36,347 --> 00:08:38,649
Chun Jong Bum reported it
outside the gallery...

97
00:08:39,055 --> 00:08:40,551
at 9:45 p.m.

98
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,056
The painting Gong Ji Chul drew is
hung here.

99
00:09:19,057 --> 00:09:21,492
It's the painting he drew
after killing a woman.

100
00:09:32,904 --> 00:09:34,672
Do you think you're the only one
in danger?

101
00:09:34,872 --> 00:09:37,074
Isn't there anyone that you want
to protect?

102
00:09:55,874 --> 00:09:57,423
(Chief Prosecutor Chun Seok Tae)

103
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:07,572
You're slow to summon Baek In Seo
for the investigation.

104
00:10:07,962 --> 00:10:09,840
So why would you dig
into something useless?

105
00:10:10,124 --> 00:10:12,540
Hand over the case of Detective Ju
over to Prosecutor Shin Hyeong Jin.

106
00:10:12,542 --> 00:10:13,911
You'll no longer be in charge.

107
00:10:14,979 --> 00:10:17,615
It's a revenge killing
of the detective who suspected him.

108
00:10:17,973 --> 00:10:20,451
He confirmed that he is
the criminal through the camera.

109
00:10:20,938 --> 00:10:24,021
I think you'd know
who the suspect is.

110
00:10:24,735 --> 00:10:26,023
Revenge killing?

111
00:10:28,588 --> 00:10:31,352
Be careful of your words.
Who killed who?

112
00:10:31,515 --> 00:10:32,743
No one's dead.

113
00:10:33,247 --> 00:10:36,167
I'll stick with this case
until the end.

114
00:10:40,437 --> 00:10:41,380
Hey.

115
00:10:42,361 --> 00:10:44,008
Do you want to go
to the Criminal Trial Department?

116
00:10:44,218 --> 00:10:47,979
Do you want to see the trash
that you put in jail...

117
00:10:48,646 --> 00:10:50,181
be released through a petition
before your eyes?

118
00:10:52,016 --> 00:10:56,420
You should swing your sword
carefully while you have it.

119
00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:00,422
You need the power to set things up,
which you like so much.

120
00:11:00,971 --> 00:11:04,362
And you can set it up
within your ground.

121
00:11:05,312 --> 00:11:06,666
Who do you think you're talking to?

122
00:11:15,651 --> 00:11:17,541
So you're going to slip away again?

123
00:11:35,144 --> 00:11:36,031
Hello, uncle.

124
00:11:36,033 --> 00:11:39,563
Forget fried chicken, the only way
to cook it properly is to boil it.

125
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:43,200
I was also healed after eating
chicken soup after being stabbed.

126
00:11:43,255 --> 00:11:44,835
Hurry over here.

127
00:12:03,411 --> 00:12:04,760
Why didn't you come yesterday?

128
00:12:04,969 --> 00:12:07,705
I knew it. You couldn't
find that bookstore.

129
00:12:08,848 --> 00:12:11,529
- I did go there.
- You were there?

130
00:12:12,067 --> 00:12:15,032
- Why didn't you...
- You were with him.

131
00:12:15,436 --> 00:12:16,388
Su Hyuk.

132
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,934
Did you see us yesterday?

133
00:12:21,936 --> 00:12:24,241
- At the Old Future...
- I saw you kissing him.

134
00:12:30,948 --> 00:12:33,807
You always kick the ground with one
foot pointed up when flustered.

135
00:12:36,624 --> 00:12:38,624
You close your mouth and speak
with your eyes.

136
00:12:39,556 --> 00:12:40,835
That look is when you're worried.

137
00:12:40,937 --> 00:12:43,494
Your muscles above your eyebrows
show strong movements,

138
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:47,498
your pupils are dilated and you
shake your head a few times firmly.

139
00:12:48,372 --> 00:12:50,356
- That's when you're angry.
- Me?

140
00:12:50,381 --> 00:12:54,920
I always wondered what face you
made in front of someone you liked.

141
00:13:03,961 --> 00:13:07,283
Jong Bum, I have something
to tell you.

142
00:13:08,564 --> 00:13:11,514
I like Su Hyuk.

143
00:13:12,741 --> 00:13:15,450
I've never liked a man this much.

144
00:13:16,145 --> 00:13:19,964
Also, just as you don't change...

145
00:13:20,598 --> 00:13:24,001
my emotions won't change either.

146
00:13:24,193 --> 00:13:26,451
Do you think he'll be
able to protect you?

147
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:31,751
We'll see who can protect you.

148
00:13:33,817 --> 00:13:36,449
I have reports to submit,
I'll be going now.

149
00:13:44,807 --> 00:13:46,257
I also like chicken soup.

150
00:14:12,403 --> 00:14:14,952
He was blocking me
from entering your heart.

151
00:14:15,239 --> 00:14:16,633
I needed to kill him.

152
00:14:18,874 --> 00:14:22,960
This is the first time I wanted
to kill someone for love.

153
00:14:31,219 --> 00:14:32,509
Do you want to go
on a date with me?

154
00:14:38,042 --> 00:14:39,881
Where are you?

155
00:14:40,017 --> 00:14:40,841
Here.

156
00:16:06,562 --> 00:16:08,098
That was the face.

157
00:16:19,777 --> 00:16:23,576
Will I be able to have her?

158
00:16:35,739 --> 00:16:38,574
This is a date, right?

159
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,361
You can only go on dates
if you're alive.

160
00:16:42,847 --> 00:16:45,869
When you shoot a gun,
stand at shoulder width,

161
00:16:45,912 --> 00:16:49,636
grab the gun not at the bottom,
make sure you grab the handle.

162
00:16:50,069 --> 00:16:51,642
Keep your eyes fixed at the front.

163
00:16:52,627 --> 00:16:53,630
Try holding it.

164
00:16:54,658 --> 00:16:57,648
- These aren't real, are they?
- They're real bullets.

165
00:17:03,518 --> 00:17:05,155
Now, try shooting the gun.

166
00:17:06,872 --> 00:17:08,265
You should move.

167
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:12,413
I've shot plenty
of toy guns in my past.

168
00:17:20,595 --> 00:17:22,049
That surprised me.

169
00:17:22,604 --> 00:17:25,912
- Try it again.
- Okay, here I go.

170
00:17:28,509 --> 00:17:29,617
Again.

171
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,141
I'll do it again.

172
00:17:46,285 --> 00:17:48,832
My fights are usually done
with these in hand,

173
00:17:48,906 --> 00:17:50,701
I don't fight with parking tickets.

174
00:17:51,167 --> 00:17:54,438
Just by holding these,
someone can get hurt.

175
00:17:56,098 --> 00:17:58,392
If I don't use them right,
either I...

176
00:17:58,876 --> 00:18:00,323
or the person next to me will die.

177
00:18:21,441 --> 00:18:24,068
Did you always like shooting?

178
00:18:24,802 --> 00:18:26,904
I've never seen you more focused.

179
00:18:28,401 --> 00:18:31,108
When I shoot 10 bullets,
I always miss the last 2.

180
00:18:32,176 --> 00:18:36,080
I miss the first bullet because it
reminds me of my father's last look,

181
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,099
and I miss the second...

182
00:18:39,131 --> 00:18:42,986
because it reminds me of my face
when I couldn't protect my father.

183
00:18:43,116 --> 00:18:46,623
Did your father pass away?

184
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:50,894
He looked a lot like you.

185
00:18:56,121 --> 00:18:59,737
That face, the trusting face.

186
00:19:01,105 --> 00:19:04,475
That's why looking at you makes me
both worried and angry.

187
00:19:05,671 --> 00:19:08,684
So I have to protect you
no matter what.

188
00:19:08,761 --> 00:19:09,793
I...

189
00:19:11,135 --> 00:19:12,850
won't be a scar to you...

190
00:19:14,084 --> 00:19:16,220
like your father was.

191
00:19:18,055 --> 00:19:19,356
I promise you.

192
00:19:48,332 --> 00:19:50,000
My mom told me...

193
00:19:51,372 --> 00:19:53,457
only death is a perfect possession.

194
00:19:53,923 --> 00:19:55,547
You won't change, will you?

195
00:19:55,738 --> 00:19:58,195
That's the only reason
I'm not killing you.

196
00:20:08,743 --> 00:20:10,707
I took care of it.

197
00:20:11,113 --> 00:20:15,084
The photos on his phone...

198
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,515
will be sent to your laptop.

199
00:20:19,329 --> 00:20:21,416
You got the laptop, right?

200
00:22:28,504 --> 00:22:29,644
Look what we have here.

201
00:22:32,249 --> 00:22:33,850
We keep bumping into each other.

202
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:35,949
Why are you laughing?

203
00:22:43,259 --> 00:22:44,827
(Power off)

204
00:22:55,405 --> 00:22:58,075
What are you doing?
Come out quickly.

205
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,082
It's getting cold.

206
00:23:15,074 --> 00:23:17,794
Handsome men like Jong Bum don't...

207
00:23:17,934 --> 00:23:19,996
have any dating techniques.
Do you know why?

208
00:23:19,996 --> 00:23:23,233
It's because the girls just line up
and wait for their turn.

209
00:23:23,784 --> 00:23:24,816
So that makes me think...

210
00:23:24,818 --> 00:23:28,138
that you've never had
any real relationships, have you?

211
00:23:28,327 --> 00:23:31,105
Men should not be naive.

212
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,536
They need to be a little spicy
to make the girls cry.

213
00:23:34,544 --> 00:23:38,165
He only talks about women
every time he opens his mouth.

214
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:40,611
Your relationships are not real.

215
00:23:41,181 --> 00:23:43,002
You only took advantage of them.

216
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:46,697
He's too old now
for girls to notice.

217
00:23:47,756 --> 00:23:52,202
You're making fun of me
when you look like a fish.

218
00:23:52,218 --> 00:23:53,997
Jong Bum,

219
00:23:54,564 --> 00:23:57,090
you should never date
someone who is...

220
00:23:57,092 --> 00:23:59,387
well aware of their good appearance.

221
00:23:59,389 --> 00:24:01,559
Wounds on the body may disappear,

222
00:24:01,754 --> 00:24:04,887
but wounds in the heart...

223
00:24:04,889 --> 00:24:07,611
cannot be erased even with a laser.

224
00:24:08,109 --> 00:24:09,247
You got that?

225
00:24:10,213 --> 00:24:12,649
Look at these uncles.

226
00:24:12,849 --> 00:24:16,253
You only gave me the rice crush,
and you gave Jong Bum chicken.

227
00:24:16,253 --> 00:24:18,021
You can only see Jong Bum
and not me.

228
00:24:21,238 --> 00:24:23,458
It's been two days since you got out
of the hospital. You can't drink.

229
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:27,230
Let me have just one drink.
It's healthy if you drink happily.

230
00:24:30,066 --> 00:24:32,235
My superior
from my baseball club is coming.

231
00:24:32,536 --> 00:24:34,671
I'm sorry,
but I think I'll have to go.

232
00:24:36,779 --> 00:24:38,920
You're the chef,
yet you've become a heavy drinker.

233
00:24:38,922 --> 00:24:40,057
Go and work.

234
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,812
Geez.

235
00:24:42,431 --> 00:24:44,581
By the way, Jong Bum,

236
00:24:45,277 --> 00:24:48,481
don't let Sa Bin fall asleep.

237
00:24:49,329 --> 00:24:51,613
She knows it's not good,

238
00:24:51,688 --> 00:24:53,688
but she drinks little by little...

239
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:56,626
and falls asleep flat on her face.

240
00:24:58,551 --> 00:24:59,996
That's our lifelong problem.

241
00:25:14,689 --> 00:25:16,146
You looked happy.

242
00:25:19,832 --> 00:25:22,269
That was the happiest look
I've seen...

243
00:25:23,422 --> 00:25:26,323
ever since I've met Jung Sa Bin
as a person.

244
00:25:27,352 --> 00:25:29,352
She had gotten a heart transplant.

245
00:25:30,287 --> 00:25:32,452
Her uncles are ex-convicts,

246
00:25:33,786 --> 00:25:35,159
and her father is sick.

247
00:25:36,336 --> 00:25:38,255
She didn't have a mother
since she was born.

248
00:25:39,771 --> 00:25:41,206
That means...

249
00:25:41,901 --> 00:25:44,007
you too can become happy.

250
00:25:46,076 --> 00:25:48,478
You only need to see
what you have right now.

251
00:25:51,314 --> 00:25:52,716
What I have...

252
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:20,877
Unhappy people only wish
for things that cannot come true.

253
00:26:23,038 --> 00:26:24,606
Do I look unhappy?

254
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:28,582
You wish to forget your past,

255
00:26:28,718 --> 00:26:30,353
but you're not removing it
from yourself.

256
00:26:34,479 --> 00:26:36,918
If you have nowhere to throw it out,
throw it at me.

257
00:26:38,005 --> 00:26:39,162
What do you mean?

258
00:26:40,864 --> 00:26:43,200
Can you tell me what happened...

259
00:26:44,551 --> 00:26:45,863
when you were 15?

260
00:26:48,734 --> 00:26:49,869
Jong Bum.

261
00:27:06,158 --> 00:27:07,949
They say those people infected
with evil...

262
00:27:08,574 --> 00:27:10,170
have their first moments.

263
00:27:32,926 --> 00:27:35,295
I only thought you didn't like me.

264
00:27:37,153 --> 00:27:40,190
But I realized it
after observing you.

265
00:27:42,025 --> 00:27:44,094
You just can't feel any emotion.

266
00:27:45,662 --> 00:27:47,662
Your emotionless face was not
apathy,

267
00:27:49,666 --> 00:27:51,234
but you just didn't feel it at all.

268
00:27:52,469 --> 00:27:54,337
My heart is hurting so much,

269
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:57,839
but you couldn't feel anything.

270
00:27:59,081 --> 00:28:00,016
You fool.

271
00:28:01,378 --> 00:28:02,426
You're stupid.

272
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:20,785
That was when I realized...

273
00:28:22,098 --> 00:28:24,098
that I was different
from other people.

274
00:28:32,075 --> 00:28:34,075
I believed in the world after death.

275
00:28:35,512 --> 00:28:36,846
During those three days,

276
00:28:38,148 --> 00:28:40,148
I thought she might be able...

277
00:28:40,783 --> 00:28:43,160
to live again miraculously.

278
00:28:57,221 --> 00:28:58,823
After a while,

279
00:29:02,572 --> 00:29:05,075
I started to paint unconsciously.

280
00:29:06,899 --> 00:29:10,055
Why did you
admit to that murder?

281
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:11,549
It's because I knew...

282
00:29:13,483 --> 00:29:15,518
murder gave me freedom.

283
00:29:22,152 --> 00:29:24,788
No one is born a murderer
in this world.

284
00:29:25,449 --> 00:29:26,484
Freedom?

285
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:28,264
You were scared back then.

286
00:29:28,965 --> 00:29:31,034
You probably didn't have anyone
to talk about your fear.

287
00:29:32,035 --> 00:29:33,403
There was probably no one...

288
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:35,759
to scold you for doing wrong.

289
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:39,009
Your brother tried to
make you eat detergent.

290
00:29:39,815 --> 00:29:44,114
Your father didn't believe
that you weren't a murderer.

291
00:29:44,347 --> 00:29:46,916
How about your mother?
Was she different?

292
00:29:47,456 --> 00:29:49,392
No one in your family...

293
00:29:49,462 --> 00:29:51,797
came looking for you,
except your brother...

294
00:29:52,163 --> 00:29:54,114
who tried to feed you detergent.

295
00:29:58,728 --> 00:30:01,297
Do you want to become a family?

296
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:02,560
A family?

297
00:30:02,562 --> 00:30:04,934
A family that will take your side
and scold you when you're wrong.

298
00:30:05,481 --> 00:30:08,421
If I'm your family,
all my uncles are your family too.

299
00:30:10,709 --> 00:30:12,456
I'm an ex-convict too,

300
00:30:13,498 --> 00:30:14,956
so I guess we are family.

301
00:30:16,671 --> 00:30:19,749
Then let's have a drink
to celebrate becoming a family.

302
00:30:23,371 --> 00:30:24,335
Have a seat.

303
00:30:30,991 --> 00:30:32,147
Here.

304
00:30:50,999 --> 00:30:53,616
I've watched "Romeo and Juliet"
countless times.

305
00:30:55,569 --> 00:30:58,121
I realized the reason
why Romeo killed himself...

306
00:30:58,588 --> 00:31:00,975
after Juliet, whom he loved, died,

307
00:31:03,226 --> 00:31:05,995
and why Juliet committed suicide...

308
00:31:06,402 --> 00:31:08,129
after seeing Romeo,
who died because of her.

309
00:31:09,073 --> 00:31:11,467
I only realized it by the time
I could memorize the book.

310
00:31:13,522 --> 00:31:14,956
That I will never...

311
00:31:16,788 --> 00:31:18,788
be able to feel that.

312
00:31:30,647 --> 00:31:32,833
People call this love.

313
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:36,826
Your eyes feel hot,

314
00:31:37,894 --> 00:31:39,262
your mouth begins to dry,

315
00:31:40,326 --> 00:31:41,898
you become breathless,

316
00:31:44,576 --> 00:31:45,774
and you become vulnerable.

317
00:31:48,038 --> 00:31:49,906
We're so close,

318
00:31:52,616 --> 00:31:54,663
yet I'm scared you'll disappear.

319
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,904
Don't be my family...

320
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:18,635
but my woman.

321
00:33:02,042 --> 00:33:03,666
(Episode 20)

322
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:23,664
What is he doing out here
in the cold?

323
00:33:29,188 --> 00:33:30,471
Jong Bum.

324
00:33:35,457 --> 00:33:37,745
- Take responsibility.
- Sorry?

325
00:33:38,953 --> 00:33:40,706
- I...
- You?

326
00:33:41,018 --> 00:33:42,612
got a cold. You're responsible.

327
00:33:43,587 --> 00:33:45,119
My gosh.

328
00:33:47,774 --> 00:33:49,290
It's so cold.

329
00:33:54,063 --> 00:33:56,130
Did Prosecutor Kim buy
that watch for you?

330
00:33:56,383 --> 00:33:58,232
This one?

331
00:34:00,141 --> 00:34:03,671
I'll take care of the rest.
Will you take the pots to uncles?

332
00:34:03,871 --> 00:34:04,938
I'll do that.

333
00:34:14,114 --> 00:34:15,883
You shouldn't soak this in water.

334
00:34:21,422 --> 00:34:22,797
Gosh, I'm so sorry.

335
00:34:22,798 --> 00:34:24,825
It's okay.

336
00:34:24,826 --> 00:34:26,727
It won't go out of order
since it's a high-tech.

337
00:34:38,339 --> 00:34:41,075
The memory chip of Detective Ju's
phone is severely damaged,

338
00:34:41,076 --> 00:34:42,776
so we're trying
a partial restoration now.

339
00:34:42,777 --> 00:34:44,812
Here. Can you hear this?

340
00:34:44,813 --> 00:34:46,447
It's Detective Ju's voice.

341
00:34:46,647 --> 00:34:48,716
- Yes.
- How about that of the culprit?

342
00:34:48,717 --> 00:34:50,984
We need to do more analysis
of the voice.

343
00:34:51,446 --> 00:34:54,766
This analysis system can track down
the component of the voice...

344
00:34:54,768 --> 00:34:57,257
and figure out the age, gender,

345
00:34:57,258 --> 00:34:58,726
and height of its owner.

346
00:34:58,727 --> 00:35:01,095
It's like a composite sketch
of a voice.

347
00:35:01,096 --> 00:35:03,831
We can contrast it with the voice
of the suspect.

348
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:07,212
- Give me a call when it's over.
- Yes, sir.

349
00:35:16,508 --> 00:35:19,580
You look so familiar.

350
00:35:19,885 --> 00:35:21,641
Could you put your hair down?

351
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:23,376
Won't you do it?

352
00:35:24,058 --> 00:35:25,719
You are a friend of Jung Sa Bin.

353
00:35:26,238 --> 00:35:28,328
Let me introduce myself. I'm Jae Yi.

354
00:35:28,338 --> 00:35:29,806
I'm a 3D graphic designer...

355
00:35:29,808 --> 00:35:31,942
- and restore through hologram...
- I'll see you next time.

356
00:35:34,735 --> 00:35:36,230
Do you like Sa Bin?

357
00:35:43,217 --> 00:35:45,417
If you do, I have something
to tell you.

358
00:35:45,419 --> 00:35:46,553
What is it?

359
00:35:50,944 --> 00:35:53,046
Sa Bin is being followed
by a stalker.

360
00:35:53,147 --> 00:35:56,216
The way I see it, he's 90 percent
a psychopath.

361
00:35:56,447 --> 00:35:59,620
He downloaded a tracking app
on her phone and stole her diary.

362
00:35:59,878 --> 00:36:02,099
He watches over every move
Sa Bin makes.

363
00:36:08,656 --> 00:36:11,298
Thank you. I'll return it as soon as
this lecture is over.

364
00:36:11,299 --> 00:36:13,000
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

365
00:36:20,629 --> 00:36:21,863
Broken heart syndrome.

366
00:36:22,409 --> 00:36:23,677
This is...

367
00:36:23,877 --> 00:36:26,413
one of the syndromes...

368
00:36:26,414 --> 00:36:28,501
that take place when you lose
the one you love.

369
00:36:28,501 --> 00:36:32,688
A healthy heart will be
damaged drastically.

370
00:36:32,887 --> 00:36:35,923
A heart has memory function,

371
00:36:36,124 --> 00:36:39,359
which means the neurons
of a heart can remember.

372
00:36:39,704 --> 00:36:42,463
There are many cells in the heart.

373
00:36:42,464 --> 00:36:45,699
I can kill Jung Sa Bin,
and you can kill me.

374
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:48,079
But which one will happen first?

375
00:36:49,766 --> 00:36:52,840
A heart has short-term
and long-term memory.

376
00:36:52,841 --> 00:36:54,735
The neurons in the brain...

377
00:37:02,986 --> 00:37:04,125
Jong Bum.

378
00:37:04,127 --> 00:37:07,186
Chun Jong Bum.
What's with this flower?

379
00:37:07,188 --> 00:37:08,422
And what about this card?

380
00:37:09,414 --> 00:37:11,024
(Purple tulip. Eternal love
completed by death. Jong Bum.)

381
00:37:11,705 --> 00:37:13,827
Do you have feelings for...

382
00:37:22,167 --> 00:37:24,157
What's happening?

383
00:37:24,438 --> 00:37:25,571
Jong Bum, help us.

384
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,344
Your body is too cold.

385
00:37:30,744 --> 00:37:32,212
Chun Jong Bum!

386
00:37:41,609 --> 00:37:43,457
It had a cardiac stimulant in it.

387
00:37:45,421 --> 00:37:47,653
The component that is extracted
from a certain flower...

388
00:37:47,655 --> 00:37:49,155
was found from the coffee.

389
00:37:49,263 --> 00:37:52,132
A small amount can be critical
for people with heart disease.

390
00:37:52,302 --> 00:37:53,804
They can get a heart attack.

391
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:58,477
But who sent it, if you didn't?

392
00:37:58,944 --> 00:38:02,347
Someone brought the flower and card
while I wasn't here.

393
00:38:02,349 --> 00:38:03,844
I don't know who it is,

394
00:38:05,383 --> 00:38:06,853
but that person was after you.

395
00:38:07,735 --> 00:38:10,671
If you finished your lecture,
I can take you home,

396
00:38:10,884 --> 00:38:11,818
Sa Bin.

397
00:38:11,986 --> 00:38:13,420
Sa Bin?

398
00:38:15,133 --> 00:38:17,224
Anyway, you can go first.

399
00:38:17,225 --> 00:38:19,555
I'll take Bo Hye to her house
when she wakes up.

400
00:38:19,718 --> 00:38:23,079
I'll wait. I need to talk to you.

401
00:38:28,742 --> 00:38:30,057
This is a watch.

402
00:38:31,091 --> 00:38:32,603
It was broken because of me.

403
00:38:32,605 --> 00:38:34,238
It's okay. I can get it repaired.

404
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,241
I don't think that's possible
because it's sensitive.

405
00:38:36,541 --> 00:38:39,688
- Or I'll send you the repair costs.
- It's okay.

406
00:38:45,047 --> 00:38:47,836
- I'll pick you up in the morning.
- That's not necessary.

407
00:38:54,755 --> 00:38:58,067
I warned you to learn to feel...

408
00:38:58,069 --> 00:39:00,971
- sorry for the one hurt by you.
- I told you too.

409
00:39:01,711 --> 00:39:03,484
I'm not the type you can teach.

410
00:39:04,462 --> 00:39:08,332
House, the hospital,
the NFS, and Body Heat.

411
00:39:08,727 --> 00:39:10,410
Where are you going
to follow her next?

412
00:39:11,148 --> 00:39:13,406
I need to tell Sa Bin...

413
00:39:14,351 --> 00:39:15,649
what can be really dangerous.

414
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:19,519
You killed someone at 15 and became
a murder suspect at 23.

415
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:21,488
And you stand by the woman I like.

416
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,195
What could be more dangerous
than that?

417
00:39:26,254 --> 00:39:30,235
I'll take care of my body.
Would you two go home now?

418
00:39:30,351 --> 00:39:32,885
I need to get a rest.

419
00:39:36,336 --> 00:39:38,505
- Please go in.
- You and I?

420
00:39:39,047 --> 00:39:41,524
I have to check
whether no one's lurking around...

421
00:39:41,567 --> 00:39:42,909
before I go.

422
00:39:53,754 --> 00:39:56,990
But what is that?

423
00:40:00,517 --> 00:40:02,138
Could I go in for a minute?

424
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:05,332
Would you give me a minute
to clean up?

425
00:40:07,028 --> 00:40:08,555
I only need a place to sit.

426
00:40:09,303 --> 00:40:10,404
I see.

427
00:40:13,704 --> 00:40:14,766
Open it.

428
00:40:22,154 --> 00:40:24,857
What did I have in my mind?

429
00:40:25,921 --> 00:40:27,763
I'll tell you how to use each one.

430
00:40:29,496 --> 00:40:32,180
This is a tear gas gun. Take it.

431
00:40:33,985 --> 00:40:35,729
Please take it.

432
00:40:36,192 --> 00:40:37,468
Well.

433
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:39,817
Tear gas gun, pepper spray,
self-defense rod, and a stun gun.

434
00:40:39,819 --> 00:40:41,571
Do you want me to carry
those around?

435
00:40:46,459 --> 00:40:48,962
A detective who's been investigating
Lim Hwa Young's case...

436
00:40:48,964 --> 00:40:50,857
was stabbed wildly at a gallery.

437
00:40:50,952 --> 00:40:53,239
And Chun Jong Bum was caught
on the camera in the gallery.

438
00:40:54,063 --> 00:40:55,977
You never listen to me,

439
00:40:56,376 --> 00:40:58,334
and he's always by your side.

440
00:40:58,336 --> 00:40:59,915
I don't think Jong Bum did that...

441
00:41:00,427 --> 00:41:03,323
- to Detective Ju In Do.
- What did you say?

442
00:41:04,711 --> 00:41:05,792
I...

443
00:41:06,622 --> 00:41:08,857
can even commune with a corpse.

444
00:41:09,367 --> 00:41:12,508
I've seen what Jong Bum is like.

445
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:14,508
I was able to commune with him.

446
00:41:14,801 --> 00:41:17,086
He goes between good and evil
numerous times in a day,

447
00:41:17,219 --> 00:41:19,439
but he earnestly wants to change.

448
00:41:20,374 --> 00:41:23,711
- I wouldn't believe he would...
- Even if he agonized for ten hours,

449
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:26,408
he only needs three seconds to cut
someone's carotid.

450
00:41:27,187 --> 00:41:28,993
Regret and repent...

451
00:41:29,805 --> 00:41:31,813
will not bring back the dead
over three seconds.

452
00:41:32,873 --> 00:41:35,309
Chun Jong Bum killed someone
when he was 15.

453
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:38,558
Let's say he repented it.

454
00:41:39,059 --> 00:41:42,195
But painting it means he is
ruminating murder.

455
00:41:42,196 --> 00:41:44,344
He drew a picture
of the girl he killed.

456
00:41:44,346 --> 00:41:45,866
He did that to remember.

457
00:41:45,945 --> 00:41:47,180
Like a trophy.

458
00:41:48,277 --> 00:41:49,945
It makes me shudder...

459
00:41:50,203 --> 00:41:52,906
to think about him drawing you.

460
00:42:04,117 --> 00:42:06,586
If you keep driving him
as a murderer,

461
00:42:06,735 --> 00:42:08,737
he might end up like that one day.

462
00:42:09,466 --> 00:42:11,677
If there's a moment that can stop
his memory of the murder,

463
00:42:11,679 --> 00:42:12,920
it's now.

464
00:42:12,922 --> 00:42:14,261
I'll make that happen.

465
00:42:17,015 --> 00:42:20,281
My father trusted the words
of a murderer.

466
00:42:20,859 --> 00:42:22,269
Just like you now.

467
00:42:23,563 --> 00:42:26,173
Do you know the first thing he did
after his release?

468
00:42:27,321 --> 00:42:28,775
It's murder.

469
00:42:29,717 --> 00:42:32,279
Sa Bin, why...

470
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:39,252
If Jong Bum is a dangerous man,

471
00:42:39,384 --> 00:42:42,723
the one in danger now is you,
not me.

472
00:42:44,516 --> 00:42:48,165
I'll protect you.
And in order to do that,

473
00:42:48,166 --> 00:42:50,497
I won't make him a murderer.

474
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:10,050
That's right. You'll watch her
through the night.

475
00:43:10,323 --> 00:43:11,639
That's what a stalker does.

476
00:43:12,248 --> 00:43:15,400
Why? Do you want to call it a crush?

477
00:43:15,961 --> 00:43:17,961
You won't get a reduced sentence
for being a stalker.

478
00:43:17,963 --> 00:43:21,008
Don't you think it's better to be
a stalker who protects his girl,

479
00:43:21,607 --> 00:43:24,107
than a man who has no idea
who is putting her in danger?

480
00:43:24,877 --> 00:43:26,143
His girl?

481
00:43:28,138 --> 00:43:29,378
Who is your girl?

482
00:43:30,347 --> 00:43:32,234
You just want to possess her.

483
00:43:32,626 --> 00:43:34,992
What if she doesn't have feelings
for you?

484
00:43:35,528 --> 00:43:36,517
Would you kill her?

485
00:43:36,519 --> 00:43:38,315
I don't kill the one I love.

486
00:43:38,317 --> 00:43:40,108
Is this what you call love?

487
00:43:41,654 --> 00:43:43,827
You'll ruin a girl you love...

488
00:43:44,062 --> 00:43:47,420
to have her to by your side forever.
Won't you?

489
00:43:47,592 --> 00:43:48,823
Did you see it for yourself?

490
00:43:51,222 --> 00:43:54,258
There's no way
Sa Bin will choose you.

491
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:56,997
She's my woman now. Got that?

492
00:44:00,134 --> 00:44:03,253
Don't even look at her.
It's disgusting.

493
00:44:08,008 --> 00:44:10,243
Why? You can't hold back?

494
00:44:10,984 --> 00:44:12,984
Do you feel like you need
to kill someone today?

495
00:44:13,741 --> 00:44:15,332
I told you my principle.

496
00:44:15,567 --> 00:44:18,534
- Stay away from Sa Bin.
- Want to know my principle?

497
00:44:19,111 --> 00:44:21,330
Once I decide to kill someone...

498
00:44:22,037 --> 00:44:23,556
I won't stop...

499
00:44:24,368 --> 00:44:25,787
until that person is dead.

500
00:44:27,053 --> 00:44:28,637
You're finally showing
your true colors.

501
00:44:31,961 --> 00:44:34,901
Fine, start by killing me.

502
00:44:35,851 --> 00:44:38,290
Never forget that order
even if you really want...

503
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,073
to kill someone else.

504
00:44:43,451 --> 00:44:44,611
I have something to ask you.

505
00:44:51,581 --> 00:44:53,923
Would you say the same thing
if it wasn't me...

506
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:55,789
who was in love with her?

507
00:44:56,063 --> 00:44:59,626
If a normal person watches over her
and can't give her up,

508
00:45:01,732 --> 00:45:04,081
would you say the exact same
words you just said?

509
00:45:10,295 --> 00:45:13,335
Normal people don't stalk
people they like.

510
00:45:13,525 --> 00:45:15,387
You can try again if you're reborn.

511
00:45:15,868 --> 00:45:17,110
As a normal person.

512
00:45:23,925 --> 00:45:25,685
So I'm going to start trying
to be just that.

513
00:45:27,409 --> 00:45:28,610
A normal person.

514
00:45:36,332 --> 00:45:37,864
Want to know my principle?

515
00:45:38,492 --> 00:45:40,524
Once I decide to kill someone...

516
00:45:41,372 --> 00:45:42,931
I won't stop...

517
00:45:44,303 --> 00:45:45,642
until that person is dead.

518
00:45:55,715 --> 00:45:57,515
Once Detective Ju's
memory chip is restored,

519
00:45:57,517 --> 00:45:59,320
compare it with the voice file
I send you.

520
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:20,507
What's happening? Jong Bum, help us.

521
00:46:23,832 --> 00:46:25,521
It had a cardiac stimulant in it.

522
00:46:49,019 --> 00:46:53,690
I changed the watch but do I still
get witness protection?

523
00:47:18,943 --> 00:47:21,192
010 1237 9916.

524
00:47:21,371 --> 00:47:22,915
That's the number for my new watch.

525
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:26,439
Please protect me until I get
used to protect myself.

526
00:47:55,230 --> 00:47:59,034
There are five more USBs aside
from this one which includes...

527
00:47:59,463 --> 00:48:00,794
the photos from your gallery.

528
00:48:01,658 --> 00:48:04,477
Don't worry, I won't report
them to anyone.

529
00:48:07,348 --> 00:48:09,250
I'm going to try to be
friends with you.

530
00:48:09,808 --> 00:48:11,047
What changed?

531
00:48:11,049 --> 00:48:13,663
I found out you were
dumped by Su Hyuk.

532
00:48:15,121 --> 00:48:17,690
That triggered my interest, for you.

533
00:48:21,112 --> 00:48:22,595
I have a question.

534
00:48:23,196 --> 00:48:25,878
Are you trying to kill Sa Bin
because of Su Hyuk?

535
00:48:26,339 --> 00:48:28,089
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

536
00:48:28,091 --> 00:48:32,145
I wouldn't want to kill her quickly
if it was because of Su Hyuk.

537
00:48:32,922 --> 00:48:34,295
She needs to be hurt...

538
00:48:34,550 --> 00:48:37,626
just as much, no, a bit more
than I was.

539
00:48:39,808 --> 00:48:41,643
But if it was because of you...

540
00:48:42,515 --> 00:48:45,818
I'd want to kill her right now.
It excites me.

541
00:48:53,278 --> 00:48:54,206
How about this?

542
00:48:54,908 --> 00:48:56,654
Let me invite you this time.

543
00:48:57,357 --> 00:49:00,131
Don't you want to see
my first murder?

544
00:49:02,931 --> 00:49:04,024
Are you serious?

545
00:49:04,026 --> 00:49:06,975
Tonight at ten. I'll text you
the location.

546
00:49:23,089 --> 00:49:24,424
Chun Jong Bum.

547
00:49:25,245 --> 00:49:26,480
Jung Sa Bin.

548
00:49:31,701 --> 00:49:33,671
(Songin Elementary School,
Kyunginbaek-ro 19-38, Jungsu-gu)

549
00:49:47,290 --> 00:49:50,587
If you want to kill someone
in your head...

550
00:49:50,590 --> 00:49:53,418
paint my face on top of the person
you want to kill.

551
00:50:04,701 --> 00:50:06,363
If you still want to kill
that person...

552
00:50:06,432 --> 00:50:09,969
imagine the bloody hands
that stabbed me as your own.

553
00:50:44,714 --> 00:50:48,764
If Jong Bum kills someone, who will
be his first target?

554
00:50:49,254 --> 00:50:51,838
Come to Songin Elementary
School in Seoul.

555
00:50:57,196 --> 00:50:58,715
(A purple tulip. Eternal love
completed by death. Jong Bum.)

556
00:51:15,885 --> 00:51:16,903
Darn it.

557
00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:28,681
Take me to Songin Elementary School.

558
00:51:33,976 --> 00:51:35,711
Your phones are all in
silent mode, right?

559
00:51:41,271 --> 00:51:43,054
- Let's begin.
- Okay.

560
00:51:43,147 --> 00:51:44,555
Wasn't this the invitation?

561
00:51:44,591 --> 00:51:47,557
This is the only voice recovered
from Detective Ju's phone.

562
00:51:47,695 --> 00:51:50,734
I compared it with the voice file
you sent me.

563
00:51:50,782 --> 00:51:53,076
Once I decide to kill someone...

564
00:51:53,403 --> 00:51:55,019
I won't stop...

565
00:51:55,182 --> 00:51:56,375
until that person is dead.

566
00:51:56,389 --> 00:51:59,379
The vocal spectrum match exactly.

567
00:52:00,032 --> 00:52:01,133
They're the same person.

568
00:52:02,471 --> 00:52:03,548
Should we go get him?

569
00:52:03,550 --> 00:52:05,859
No, we can't make it official.

570
00:52:11,407 --> 00:52:13,407
The person you have dialed...

571
00:52:19,478 --> 00:52:22,035
You have a new message.

572
00:52:22,314 --> 00:52:26,065
Su Hyuk, you're not at Songin
Elementary School, are you?

573
00:52:26,067 --> 00:52:30,143
If not, that's great. Make sure
you never go there tonight.

574
00:52:36,173 --> 00:52:38,017
Songin Elementary School.

575
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:45,139
He killed a female student and then
left her in an abandoned building.

576
00:53:25,209 --> 00:53:26,866
What are you going to do
by yourself?

577
00:53:26,866 --> 00:53:28,868
He'll escape us anyway.

578
00:53:28,868 --> 00:53:30,570
People will die if he does that.

579
00:53:30,857 --> 00:53:31,925
Do you want to see that?

580
00:53:32,276 --> 00:53:34,807
Stay on standby until I call you.
Keep this a secret.

581
00:53:34,807 --> 00:53:37,711
You're always up against the world
alone, who are you to keep a secret?

582
00:53:37,777 --> 00:53:39,178
Let's go together.

583
00:54:29,191 --> 00:54:30,441
It's me, Jong Bum.

584
00:54:31,575 --> 00:54:34,534
- What is it?
- I caught the real culprit, Father.

585
00:54:35,943 --> 00:54:37,470
You said you'd trust me...

586
00:54:39,106 --> 00:54:40,773
if I caught the real culprit
behind the Lim Hwa Young case.

587
00:54:40,907 --> 00:54:42,308
You caught the real culprit?

588
00:54:42,642 --> 00:54:43,409
Yes.

589
00:54:44,477 --> 00:54:45,845
I also have evidence.

590
00:54:50,583 --> 00:54:52,457
I didn't kill her.

591
00:54:52,482 --> 00:54:53,920
Then what about Detective Ju In Do?

592
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:56,247
Did you do it?

593
00:54:59,836 --> 00:55:01,687
Are we starting...

594
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,414
a new misunderstanding?

595
00:55:05,866 --> 00:55:06,899
Let's hang up.

596
00:55:43,863 --> 00:55:45,942
(Where are you?)

597
00:57:58,086 --> 00:57:59,153
Is that you, Jong Bum?

598
00:58:16,403 --> 00:58:18,190
Don't kill anyone...

599
00:58:18,215 --> 00:58:19,859
but only Jung Sa Bin.

600
01:00:06,827 --> 01:00:07,985
I warned you.

601
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:10,269
I told you not to touch
my woman.

602
01:01:35,730 --> 01:01:37,389
(Your last moment is not revenge
but sacrifice.)

603
01:01:46,565 --> 01:01:49,435
What about me?

604
01:01:51,403 --> 01:01:52,538
No!

605
01:01:58,277 --> 01:01:59,144
Hyung Bin.

606
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:02,815
No!

607
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:10,954
I once...

608
01:02:11,690 --> 01:02:12,725
told you...

609
01:02:13,926 --> 01:02:16,195
that souls will be resurrected.

610
01:02:16,909 --> 01:02:18,397
Gong Ji Chul.

611
01:02:19,064 --> 01:02:20,432
You'll never...

612
01:02:22,434 --> 01:02:23,903
be resurrected.

613
01:03:01,734 --> 01:03:04,931
I swear to the lord and to Ha Eun's
parents in up above.

614
01:03:05,735 --> 01:03:08,781
I, Cha Hyung Bin, will risk
my life...

615
01:03:09,168 --> 01:03:11,270
and protect my bride,
Jung Ha Eun,

616
01:03:11,844 --> 01:03:13,038
until the end.

617
01:03:35,941 --> 01:03:37,810
(Born Again)

618
01:03:37,922 --> 01:03:41,080
There were 3 people who went in,
but only 2 came out.

619
01:03:41,256 --> 01:03:43,319
If you can't guarantee
that there isn't any brain damage,

620
01:03:43,329 --> 01:03:44,977
I won't agree to this surgery.

621
01:03:45,047 --> 01:03:47,386
I know he's alive.

622
01:03:47,555 --> 01:03:49,354
I saw Chun Jong Bum in Insa-dong.

623
01:03:49,355 --> 01:03:50,829
I'm sure it was him.

624
01:03:50,957 --> 01:03:53,025
It's me, Cha Hyung Bin.

625
01:03:53,026 --> 01:03:54,665
Su Hyuk found out about it.

626
01:03:54,665 --> 01:03:57,429
What's the name of the book store
of your wife?

627
01:03:57,430 --> 01:03:58,097
Ha Eun.

628
01:03:58,098 --> 01:03:59,969
You said Chun Jong Bum was dead.

629
01:04:00,366 --> 01:04:02,668
Don't die yet.
We still have a lot to do.
