00:00:01,992 --> 00:00:09,859
MYSTIC POP-UP BAR

2
00:00:11,979 --> 00:00:14,440
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGION AND INCIDENTS

3
00:00:14,523 --> 00:00:16,108
PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

4
00:00:55,022 --> 00:00:57,191
Are you Weol-ju?

5
00:01:09,578 --> 00:01:11,872
I hear you're opening a bar
in the Living Realm.

6
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,624
Yes.

7
00:01:14,917 --> 00:01:18,337
Why do you need
this much water from the Afterlife?

8
00:01:20,965 --> 00:01:22,758
When the living drink this water,

9
00:01:22,841 --> 00:01:25,511
their souls linger momentarily
in the Dream World

10
00:01:25,928 --> 00:01:28,055
between the Afterlife
and the Living Realm.

11
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:31,892
Since I have the ability to travel
the Dream World freely as I wish,

12
00:01:32,142 --> 00:01:35,187
I am planning to settle the grudges
people hold in the Dream World.

13
00:01:35,813 --> 00:01:37,273
Is it 100,000 souls?

14
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:40,776
You took your life
out of hatred for humans.

15
00:01:41,443 --> 00:01:43,904
-Are you sure you'll be okay?
-What if I'm not?

16
00:01:44,947 --> 00:01:46,365
I don't have a choice.

17
00:01:48,117 --> 00:01:51,245
Anyway, who are you and
why are you asking all these questions?

18
00:01:51,328 --> 00:01:52,246
Me?

19
00:01:52,955 --> 00:01:54,582
I am Junior Manager Yeom.

20
00:01:55,165 --> 00:01:56,625
You may also know me as Death,

21
00:01:57,001 --> 00:02:01,755
but I was ordered to watch over you
whenever I visit the Living Realm.

22
00:02:02,339 --> 00:02:03,507
That's not necessary.

23
00:02:04,216 --> 00:02:05,634
There's no need to get all prickly.

24
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,638
Just think of me as a liaison.

25
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:13,642
If it turns out to be too much,

26
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:15,561
-I will--
-Stop right there.

27
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,063
I'll succeed no matter what.

28
00:02:19,315 --> 00:02:21,734
I'll lie to them, scam them,

29
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:23,861
or use another human

30
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:26,071
if that's what it takes.

31
00:02:33,784 --> 00:02:36,370
MYSTIC POP-UP BAR

32
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,918
EPISODE 3

33
00:02:40,002 --> 00:02:42,296
<i>-Don't.
-Make way, will you?</i>

34
00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:44,423
-There's no room.
-Get off that way.

35
00:02:44,506 --> 00:02:45,924
Coming through.

36
00:02:46,175 --> 00:02:48,010
-What a jerk.
-Stop it.

37
00:02:48,093 --> 00:02:50,304
Stop leaning on me!

38
00:02:51,388 --> 00:02:53,599
<i>When I commute to work,
I want to ride on the subway.</i>

39
00:02:55,059 --> 00:02:57,686
<i>It will be amazing.
Think of how alive it will make me feel.</i>

40
00:02:58,395 --> 00:03:01,523
That's how I would like to celebrate
my new life as a normal human being.

41
00:03:04,401 --> 00:03:05,903
You're a weird one, you know that?

42
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:08,489
You're going through this much work
to be normal again,

43
00:03:08,572 --> 00:03:10,366
and all you want to do is ride the subway.

44
00:03:11,742 --> 00:03:13,786
Kang-bae, forget the subway.

45
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:16,872
Head to a sauna first.

46
00:03:16,955 --> 00:03:18,707
-Have you ever had your body scrubbed?
-No.

47
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:21,919
You poor thing.

48
00:03:22,419 --> 00:03:24,505
Getting a body scrub when you're tired

49
00:03:26,632 --> 00:03:28,133
is like being in Shangri-La.

50
00:03:28,801 --> 00:03:30,260
-Really?
-Of course.

51
00:03:31,011 --> 00:03:32,596
How about a demonstration?

52
00:03:33,138 --> 00:03:36,058
-Turn to the side.
-To the side.

53
00:03:36,141 --> 00:03:37,267
How's that?

54
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,062
-Turn around.
-Around.

55
00:03:40,437 --> 00:03:41,855
-There we go.
-That feels great.

56
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:44,233
Now, face me directly.

57
00:03:44,316 --> 00:03:45,234
-Lift your arms.
-Up!

58
00:03:45,317 --> 00:03:46,860
-Say, "Ho."
-Ho!

59
00:03:48,654 --> 00:03:50,864
Just thinking about someone
scrubbing every inch of

60
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,367
-my body...
-Hey!

61
00:03:54,451 --> 00:03:56,662
People will think you're a pervert.

62
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,330
You don't get this for free.

63
00:03:58,414 --> 00:04:00,040
You have a job to do

64
00:04:00,124 --> 00:04:02,000
and it all starts by
bringing in customers.

65
00:04:02,084 --> 00:04:05,045
-I have to bring in customers?
-Unbelievable.

66
00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:08,006
-What's your day job?
-Customer service.

67
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:09,091
What's your ability?

68
00:04:09,174 --> 00:04:11,969
People spill their worries on me
when they touch me.

69
00:04:12,052 --> 00:04:12,886
Exactly.

70
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:15,931
You have everything you need
to bring people in,

71
00:04:16,014 --> 00:04:18,726
so what are you doing
loitering around in here?

72
00:04:18,809 --> 00:04:22,187
I'm going to make use of your talent
every way I can.

73
00:04:22,813 --> 00:04:24,106
Every way?

74
00:04:28,861 --> 00:04:29,903
Hello.

75
00:04:30,237 --> 00:04:32,072
-May I have your ticket?
-Sure.

76
00:04:33,866 --> 00:04:36,660
I've been dating a younger man these days.

77
00:04:36,744 --> 00:04:39,705
I don't know what to do.
It's my son's birthday soon.

78
00:04:40,456 --> 00:04:43,208
I want to get a decent job!

79
00:04:43,292 --> 00:04:45,794
Come visit our bar.
Drinks and snacks are on the house

80
00:04:45,878 --> 00:04:47,921
and the owner there
is an amazing problem solver.

81
00:04:48,005 --> 00:04:50,632
What's wrong with me? I have a problem.

82
00:04:50,716 --> 00:04:51,967
Of course.

83
00:04:52,551 --> 00:04:53,761
-A pop-up bar?
-Yes.

84
00:04:53,844 --> 00:04:56,013
Drinks and snacks are on the house.

85
00:04:56,847 --> 00:04:58,223
Keep it just in case.

86
00:05:03,228 --> 00:05:04,062
Kang-bae.

87
00:05:05,355 --> 00:05:07,399
That thing you've been
giving out to the customers.

88
00:05:08,692 --> 00:05:10,944
Is it a coupon for the place
you work at during the night?

89
00:05:11,528 --> 00:05:12,446
Yes.

90
00:05:14,448 --> 00:05:17,034
I'd appreciate it if you kept it a secret
from Mr. Ma.

91
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:18,869
Don't you worry.

92
00:05:19,661 --> 00:05:23,165
If you're in charge
of quality control at a bar,

93
00:05:23,248 --> 00:05:26,126
shouldn't you be handing them out
good looking people?

94
00:05:26,877 --> 00:05:29,588
The people you gave the coupons to
look rather depressed mostly.

95
00:05:30,422 --> 00:05:32,424
My boss likes people
who have a lot on their minds.

96
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,760
Apparently, they're easier to work on

97
00:05:34,843 --> 00:05:36,094
-and to take advantage of.
-What?

98
00:05:37,763 --> 00:05:39,973
-Take advantage?
-Yes.

99
00:05:43,101 --> 00:05:44,436
-Would you like one too?
-What?

100
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,605
No, I'm good.

101
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:50,692
I don't have any worries at all.
It's all rainbows and sunshine for me.

102
00:05:51,443 --> 00:05:52,861
MYSTIC POP-UP BAR

103
00:05:52,945 --> 00:05:55,197
No matter what she does,
she can't seem to lose weight.

104
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,407
She's now seeing a psychiatrist
for her depression.

105
00:05:57,699 --> 00:05:59,743
I only eat minuscule portions.

106
00:06:01,787 --> 00:06:04,039
I gain weight from just drinking water.

107
00:06:04,122 --> 00:06:07,543
But people say that I'm weak,
that I have no self-control

108
00:06:07,626 --> 00:06:09,670
-and that I don't take care of myself.
-Really...

109
00:06:11,296 --> 00:06:13,757
Miss, I'd like another bottle.

110
00:06:13,924 --> 00:06:16,176
-Sure.
-Are you sure this is on the house?

111
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,803
Yes. Eat and drink as much as you want.

112
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,098
Can I get another <i>pajeon</i>?

113
00:06:21,765 --> 00:06:23,058
She's already had five of them.

114
00:06:23,141 --> 00:06:25,143
-Get out.
-Sorry?

115
00:06:25,227 --> 00:06:26,603
Stop stuffing yourself and leave.

116
00:06:26,854 --> 00:06:28,814
Get out there and run!

117
00:06:29,398 --> 00:06:31,191
Ms. Weol-ju, she's in a lot of pain--

118
00:06:31,775 --> 00:06:33,151
-You too!
-But...

119
00:06:33,527 --> 00:06:36,989
So you and your husband
haven't been connecting lately?

120
00:06:37,865 --> 00:06:41,493
My husband must not
love me as much anymore.

121
00:06:41,577 --> 00:06:45,122
You see, we used to do it
seven times a week.

122
00:06:45,914 --> 00:06:47,708
Now, that number's gone down to five.

123
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,459
How we've aged...

124
00:06:49,543 --> 00:06:52,379
Five times a week is just as admirable.

125
00:06:52,462 --> 00:06:53,881
His stamina...

126
00:06:55,716 --> 00:06:58,051
My gosh, it must be terrible.

127
00:06:59,928 --> 00:07:01,346
-Ms. Weol-ju.
-You call that a grudge?

128
00:07:02,097 --> 00:07:03,974
It looks more like she's blessed.

129
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:10,272
MYSTIC POP-UP BAR

130
00:07:19,823 --> 00:07:22,951
Don't let her push you around like that.

131
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,579
Didn't I tell you
that you're the red bean paste

132
00:07:25,954 --> 00:07:27,581
and this bar is the bun.

133
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:30,918
How can I not be intimidated?
She's really scary.

134
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:35,213
I heard she killed 100,000 people
in her past life.

135
00:07:36,298 --> 00:07:37,257
What?

136
00:07:37,716 --> 00:07:38,634
Says who?

137
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:39,635
Didn't you know?

138
00:07:39,718 --> 00:07:42,304
She said so herself
when we got drinks last time.

139
00:07:45,974 --> 00:07:48,977
-And you believe her?
-Yes, she said it's true.

140
00:07:49,311 --> 00:07:51,271
She's no Genghis Khan or Hitler.

141
00:07:51,772 --> 00:07:55,275
She lied to straighten you out
nice and early.

142
00:07:55,901 --> 00:07:57,027
Kang-bae.

143
00:07:57,778 --> 00:08:01,907
This is the time for you to be strong
and hold your ground.

144
00:08:02,491 --> 00:08:06,954
We don't have to let her boss us around
because we're her employees. No way.

145
00:08:07,037 --> 00:08:10,290
Come to think of it, being the boss

146
00:08:10,374 --> 00:08:12,250
doesn't give her the right to give orders

147
00:08:12,334 --> 00:08:13,919
without doing anything herself.

148
00:08:14,419 --> 00:08:17,839
You know what? I'll show her--

149
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:20,550
<i>How many breaks do you two take in a day?</i>

150
00:08:20,634 --> 00:08:22,552
<i>Get back to work!</i>

151
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:23,512
Coming.

152
00:08:24,638 --> 00:08:26,014
You heard her. Come on.

153
00:08:26,098 --> 00:08:27,432
Get back in there.

154
00:08:29,267 --> 00:08:31,019
<i>Kang-bae, peel some onions.</i>

155
00:08:36,441 --> 00:08:37,526
Kang-bae.

156
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:41,113
Do you not understand what a grudge is?

157
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:45,867
I do. It's a feeling of anger,
frustration and things like that.

158
00:08:45,951 --> 00:08:47,995
And yet you still bring in
useless people like that.

159
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:49,913
-People like them don't even count!
-Gosh.

160
00:08:49,997 --> 00:08:51,415
Calm down, will you?

161
00:08:51,498 --> 00:08:53,750
There's no need to bite his head off.

162
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:56,169
You can teach the boy one step at a time.

163
00:08:56,503 --> 00:08:59,715
Let's start with what qualifies
as a grudge.

164
00:09:00,298 --> 00:09:03,301
He needs a guideline of sorts, right?

165
00:09:03,468 --> 00:09:05,345
Here. Have a seat.

166
00:09:10,934 --> 00:09:12,102
Then listen up.

167
00:09:12,686 --> 00:09:16,356
First of all, a grudge is something
that cannot be settled by one's own will.

168
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,150
Others can't help you lose weight.

169
00:09:18,233 --> 00:09:21,695
Weight-loss is an arduous journey
that one must take alone.

170
00:09:21,778 --> 00:09:23,739
That's how you lose weight.

171
00:09:23,822 --> 00:09:24,990
I see.

172
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:27,993
You should take notes.

173
00:09:28,076 --> 00:09:29,953
Don't let her words of wisdom go to waste.

174
00:09:30,037 --> 00:09:32,330
Here. Write it down in red.

175
00:09:33,165 --> 00:09:34,624
"A journey that one must take alone".

176
00:09:35,292 --> 00:09:36,418
Two,

177
00:09:37,002 --> 00:09:39,421
they must not desire
more than what others have.

178
00:09:40,005 --> 00:09:41,506
That's not a grudge.

179
00:09:42,841 --> 00:09:43,800
It's greed.

180
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:45,886
She's right. It's greed.

181
00:09:46,261 --> 00:09:48,013
Winning the lottery, a nine-figure salary,

182
00:09:48,096 --> 00:09:49,806
or doing it seven times a week.

183
00:09:52,768 --> 00:09:54,728
All of those cases fall short.

184
00:09:55,437 --> 00:09:56,271
Third.

185
00:09:57,022 --> 00:09:58,815
And this is most important.

186
00:09:59,858 --> 00:10:03,111
They must be desperate.

187
00:10:03,195 --> 00:10:04,946
They should either be desperate
enough to kill

188
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:07,532
or they can't die because of their grudge

189
00:10:07,616 --> 00:10:09,951
or be in a life and death situation.

190
00:10:10,869 --> 00:10:12,496
That's what you call a grudge.

191
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:14,998
Got it?

192
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:19,836
-It won't take long.
-No can do.

193
00:10:20,837 --> 00:10:24,007
I just need to ask HR something.

194
00:10:24,091 --> 00:10:25,592
I said it's out of the question.

195
00:10:26,093 --> 00:10:27,928
The results have already been announced.

196
00:10:28,011 --> 00:10:29,387
That's how desperate I am.

197
00:10:29,471 --> 00:10:31,640
Please just let me in.

198
00:10:36,394 --> 00:10:37,479
The Chairman is coming.

199
00:10:47,405 --> 00:10:48,573
Chairman Choi!

200
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:51,076
I'm Park Byeong-jae
who applied for an opening here.

201
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:54,079
I at least need to know
why I didn't make the cut.

202
00:10:54,162 --> 00:10:55,789
If you tell me why--

203
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:00,043
Let go of me!

204
00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:02,838
What is the requirement for passing?

205
00:11:03,797 --> 00:11:05,799
How dare you get your filthy hands on me.

206
00:11:06,091 --> 00:11:08,135
Sir, please!

207
00:11:08,885 --> 00:11:10,220
Let go, you bastard!

208
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:13,682
Where do those rats even come from?

209
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:15,142
Are you all right, sir?

210
00:11:15,433 --> 00:11:17,102
I apologize for not seeing him coming.

211
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:18,812
It's not your fault.

212
00:11:19,729 --> 00:11:22,899
The men outside
should've dealt with him sooner.

213
00:11:23,608 --> 00:11:25,610
They're hardly worth the money I pay them.

214
00:11:27,154 --> 00:11:29,197
Meanwhile, you're quite useful.

215
00:11:29,281 --> 00:11:31,992
Definitely worth the fat paycheck.

216
00:11:39,124 --> 00:11:41,751
Look at how fresh the octopus is.

217
00:11:44,087 --> 00:11:45,964
Don't be too harsh on Kang-bae.

218
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:47,966
No one is good right off the bat.

219
00:11:48,758 --> 00:11:51,887
Look at the clients he's bringing me.
How can I not be on his case?

220
00:11:52,137 --> 00:11:54,264
I'll take a peek later
to see how he's doing.

221
00:11:54,347 --> 00:11:56,933
Just let him be for a while.

222
00:11:58,643 --> 00:12:01,521
-Ms. Weol-ju?
-It's been a while.

223
00:12:01,771 --> 00:12:03,064
-Hello.
-Hi.

224
00:12:03,607 --> 00:12:06,151
I see you're grocery shopping
with your husband.

225
00:12:06,234 --> 00:12:07,402
That's nice.

226
00:12:08,987 --> 00:12:10,447
You must have it easy these days.

227
00:12:11,114 --> 00:12:12,449
-Sorry?
-Have you been bored

228
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:14,451
because the customers
haven't been bothering you?

229
00:12:14,618 --> 00:12:16,578
Then how about this?

230
00:12:16,661 --> 00:12:18,830
How dare you call him my husband?

231
00:12:18,914 --> 00:12:20,957
Again with the temper. Cool down a little.

232
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:23,501
All you have to do is correct her,
not bite her head off.

233
00:12:23,585 --> 00:12:25,921
She's the boss and I'm just an employee.

234
00:12:26,421 --> 00:12:28,340
Gosh, I'm sorry for the misunderstanding.

235
00:12:28,423 --> 00:12:29,424
It's okay.

236
00:12:29,591 --> 00:12:31,593
Anyway, are you done
with the free samples?

237
00:12:32,052 --> 00:12:34,304
-You must be good.
-Actually,

238
00:12:34,888 --> 00:12:37,849
companies have been
announcing their new recruits lately.

239
00:12:38,183 --> 00:12:40,518
The moms must be
going the extra mile for dinner.

240
00:12:40,977 --> 00:12:43,271
So, the moms whose sons were accepted
are throwing a party,

241
00:12:43,939 --> 00:12:46,274
while the less fortunate
are eating their sorrows away.

242
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,401
More or less, yes.

243
00:12:48,485 --> 00:12:50,528
-Company recruits?
-Yes.

244
00:12:57,619 --> 00:12:59,287
Why Noryangjin of all places?

245
00:13:00,789 --> 00:13:03,124
Because companies
are announcing their new recruits.

246
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:06,294
The streets are filled
with men and women who were turned down.

247
00:13:06,628 --> 00:13:09,506
You're right.
There's only a slim chance of getting in.

248
00:13:09,798 --> 00:13:10,757
Exactly.

249
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,927
And all the depressed souls
will be gathering where?

250
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:16,179
Right here.

251
00:13:16,263 --> 00:13:18,390
<i>Come on and take a pick</i>

252
00:13:18,473 --> 00:13:20,141
It will be harder not to score today.

253
00:13:20,725 --> 00:13:23,061
Come on. These guys already have it tough.

254
00:13:23,228 --> 00:13:24,271
He's right.

255
00:13:24,938 --> 00:13:26,898
Your attitude is a little disturbing.

256
00:13:26,982 --> 00:13:28,275
My attitude? What about it?

257
00:13:28,525 --> 00:13:29,859
It's called strategizing.

258
00:13:29,943 --> 00:13:32,195
All you two do is follow orders,

259
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:34,906
so what would you know
about the big picture?

260
00:13:59,806 --> 00:14:01,599
MY LOVE YU-MI

261
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:08,315
DECLINE

262
00:14:17,032 --> 00:14:19,451
NORYANGJIN STATION

263
00:14:19,534 --> 00:14:21,411
MYSTIC POP-UP BAR

264
00:14:28,418 --> 00:14:29,711
Can I have a bottle of soju?

265
00:14:32,922 --> 00:14:34,382
Okay.

266
00:14:39,888 --> 00:14:42,766
See what I mean? Right on the mark.

267
00:15:16,782 --> 00:15:17,825
Hold on.

268
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:22,121
He's crying. Maybe it's too spicy.

269
00:15:22,705 --> 00:15:25,499
It's a stir-fried octopus.
Of course, it's spicy.

270
00:15:28,085 --> 00:15:30,171
Is it spicy enough
to bring someone to tears though?

271
00:15:40,556 --> 00:15:41,599
Gosh.

272
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:43,726
Water.

273
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:46,937
-What the...
-Oh, no.

274
00:15:47,021 --> 00:15:48,564
I'll go buy some milk.

275
00:16:01,118 --> 00:16:01,952
Here.

276
00:16:02,912 --> 00:16:06,123
If it's too spicy, have this with it.

277
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,340
I wanted to

278
00:16:15,257 --> 00:16:17,176
have it with Yu-mi.

279
00:16:19,553 --> 00:16:20,805
Stir-fried octopus.

280
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:33,192
Byeong-jae, it's been a while.

281
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:36,987
Hi, I'm sorry about that.

282
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:38,739
Since you're sorry...

283
00:16:40,115 --> 00:16:41,534
I'm sorry about that too.

284
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:43,661
I'll pay the rent by this month.

285
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:47,915
Come on. You haven't paid
your rent for three months now.

286
00:16:47,998 --> 00:16:50,960
If you don't pay this month,
you'll be thrown out.

287
00:16:51,544 --> 00:16:52,586
Sure.

288
00:16:54,088 --> 00:16:54,964
<i>Here you go.</i>

289
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:56,632
-Have a good day.
-You too.

290
00:17:02,471 --> 00:17:03,597
Welcome.

291
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:07,560
-Hi, Yu-mi.
-<i>It's me. Is your shift over?</i>

292
00:17:08,143 --> 00:17:10,896
Yes, the manager just arrived.
I'll be off soon.

293
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:12,231
Why?

294
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:14,358
<i>Isn't it obvious?
I want to have dinner with you.</i>

295
00:17:14,942 --> 00:17:15,776
Dinner?

296
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,905
I have a lot of studying to do today.

297
00:17:20,155 --> 00:17:21,866
<i>It's our seven-year anniversary.</i>

298
00:17:21,949 --> 00:17:24,493
-<i>You'll make your girlfriend eat alone?</i>
-No,

299
00:17:25,578 --> 00:17:27,663
of course I'll join you.

300
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:28,956
Sure thing.

301
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:30,666
Got it.

302
00:17:37,381 --> 00:17:39,466
<i>I've been studying for years
to find a job.</i>

303
00:17:40,009 --> 00:17:42,344
<i>puts a toll on your finances.</i>

304
00:17:43,178 --> 00:17:45,890
<i>My part-time job
couldn't even cover the rent</i>

305
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:49,894
<i>and soon it became harder for me
to meet up with my girlfriend.</i>

306
00:17:49,977 --> 00:17:51,103
<i>SSANGKWANJANG</i>

307
00:17:51,186 --> 00:17:54,315
Promise me that you'll take one
every day until the interview.

308
00:17:54,398 --> 00:17:56,108
Sure. Thanks again.

309
00:17:57,443 --> 00:18:00,237
I was too busy studying
to buy you a present.

310
00:18:00,529 --> 00:18:01,655
Don't sweat it.

311
00:18:02,615 --> 00:18:04,199
Dinner will be on me though.

312
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,201
We're here.

313
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:07,161
Hold on.

314
00:18:07,745 --> 00:18:09,121
Is this where we're going?

315
00:18:09,204 --> 00:18:11,373
The place is all over social media.

316
00:18:11,874 --> 00:18:13,250
Really?

317
00:18:13,876 --> 00:18:14,877
STIR-FRIED OCTOPUS
23,000 WON PER PERSON

318
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,879
You love spicy food too. Come on.

319
00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:20,633
What's wrong?

320
00:18:21,216 --> 00:18:22,092
Are you sick?

321
00:18:22,176 --> 00:18:26,138
My stomach has been acting up lately.

322
00:18:27,222 --> 00:18:29,391
I don't think I can eat
anything spicy today.

323
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:32,102
Byeong-jae?

324
00:18:33,562 --> 00:18:34,772
It's good to see you.

325
00:18:36,106 --> 00:18:38,275
Has it been two years
since our study group?

326
00:18:38,651 --> 00:18:40,194
Sounds about right.

327
00:18:40,277 --> 00:18:41,946
We're here to eat too, so join us.

328
00:18:44,031 --> 00:18:46,909
I'm sorry, but you caught us
on our way out.

329
00:18:47,618 --> 00:18:49,495
Really? That's too bad.

330
00:18:49,787 --> 00:18:51,747
Where did you say you worked again?

331
00:18:52,581 --> 00:18:53,415
Well...

332
00:18:54,249 --> 00:18:55,501
Are you still searching?

333
00:18:57,711 --> 00:18:58,879
Sangil Hotel.

334
00:18:59,296 --> 00:19:00,881
The results will be announced soon.

335
00:19:00,965 --> 00:19:02,466
We'll get together once they're out.

336
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:06,929
Sure, we'll meet up then.

337
00:19:07,554 --> 00:19:09,306
Let's head inside.

338
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:16,271
Byeong-jae, let's go.

339
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:18,273
Come on.

340
00:19:26,615 --> 00:19:27,574
Gosh, it's good.

341
00:19:28,325 --> 00:19:30,869
-Why aren't you eating? It's delicious.
-Nothing.

342
00:19:33,956 --> 00:19:37,042
I just have an upset stomach, that's all.
You go ahead.

343
00:19:54,476 --> 00:19:57,104
What a good looking couple.
We offer cheap rooms.

344
00:19:57,646 --> 00:19:59,523
Will you be staying overnight
or for a few hours?

345
00:19:59,606 --> 00:20:01,275
We were just passing through.

346
00:20:01,358 --> 00:20:04,319
Come on, brother.
I can tell you don't have a lot of money,

347
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:07,406
so let me offer you something cheap.

348
00:20:07,781 --> 00:20:09,366
Will you let your girlfriend down?

349
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:12,953
What? It's just...

350
00:20:13,954 --> 00:20:17,833
I am kind of tired today though.
Maybe it's the heels,

351
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,877
but my legs feel bloated.

352
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,836
Really?

353
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:22,880
-Why didn't you tell me sooner?
-Well...

354
00:20:23,213 --> 00:20:24,923
Come on. I'll take you home.

355
00:20:25,007 --> 00:20:27,968
What? Byeong-jae, come on.

356
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:29,053
I mean...

357
00:20:30,763 --> 00:20:33,098
you've been under a lot of stress lately,

358
00:20:33,724 --> 00:20:35,225
so it doesn't seem

359
00:20:35,392 --> 00:20:38,062
like a bad idea
to squeeze in some shut-eye.

360
00:20:38,145 --> 00:20:39,646
Here you go.

361
00:20:40,022 --> 00:20:42,983
I have a lot to go over tonight.

362
00:20:43,567 --> 00:20:45,611
Books aren't the only source of education.

363
00:20:45,694 --> 00:20:48,363
Life lessons are taught
in these alleys every day.

364
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:50,949
Everyone knows that these places

365
00:20:51,033 --> 00:20:53,577
offer more insight than schools.

366
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:54,912
That's enough.

367
00:20:56,955 --> 00:20:58,707
-Let's go.
-But...

368
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:03,253
They used to say
that you can't put a price on love.

369
00:21:03,337 --> 00:21:05,089
I guess it's no longer true these days.

370
00:21:05,672 --> 00:21:07,299
We're offering cheap rooms tonight!

371
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,969
Still, when you're young you should...

372
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:15,849
Right. It must've been hard for you two.

373
00:21:17,017 --> 00:21:18,102
I feel

374
00:21:19,853 --> 00:21:21,063
bad for her.

375
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:24,566
Because she's dating me,
she has to be self-conscious all the time.

376
00:21:25,692 --> 00:21:26,902
What kind of a man

377
00:21:26,985 --> 00:21:30,447
doesn't have the money
to buy his girlfriend stir-fried octopus?

378
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:35,953
You applied for a job
at Sangil Hotel for three years?

379
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:37,663
Yes.

380
00:21:37,746 --> 00:21:41,041
Working there is a dream
for people who studied hotel management.

381
00:21:42,042 --> 00:21:43,585
It's a public enterprise

382
00:21:44,711 --> 00:21:45,879
and has a decent salary.

383
00:21:46,797 --> 00:21:50,050
Why couldn't you settle on a job
that had less competition?

384
00:21:50,134 --> 00:21:53,053
You wasted all those years
because of your greed.

385
00:21:55,305 --> 00:21:57,850
I could have settled on a lesser job.

386
00:21:58,433 --> 00:22:01,478
But most people who do quit
after four to five years.

387
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,355
Once you're 40,

388
00:22:03,438 --> 00:22:05,941
you have to worry about
when you'll get the boot.

389
00:22:06,733 --> 00:22:09,570
I have to get married, have kids,
and save up for when I retire.

390
00:22:11,572 --> 00:22:13,115
Finding a lesser job won't cut it.

391
00:22:14,408 --> 00:22:16,660
Right, everyone has it hard these days.

392
00:22:16,743 --> 00:22:19,371
I know because I saved a couple of people

393
00:22:19,454 --> 00:22:22,332
who tried to commit suicide
after their companies went under.

394
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:25,085
So? What happened with the job?

395
00:22:26,795 --> 00:22:30,215
Well, I aced the written exam

396
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:35,012
and I thought I had nailed the interview.

397
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:48,192
SANGIL HOTEL HR DEPARTMENT

398
00:22:52,863 --> 00:22:55,032
THE RESULTS OF THE SANGIL HOTEL
OPEN RECRUITMENT FOR 2020

399
00:22:56,867 --> 00:22:59,536
WE HAVE DECIDED NOT TO RECRUIT YOU

400
00:23:24,019 --> 00:23:25,979
YU-MI'S MOTHER

401
00:23:27,564 --> 00:23:30,651
You're a sweet boy with a good heart

402
00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:32,653
and that's why I saw a future in you.

403
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:36,281
But I see no end to the tunnel you're in.

404
00:23:37,783 --> 00:23:38,909
I'm sorry.

405
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,541
I'm just worried that Yu-mi might end up
wasting all of her good days

406
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:49,628
to take care of her boyfriend.

407
00:23:50,671 --> 00:23:53,257
I hope you don't take this personally.

408
00:23:53,924 --> 00:23:56,009
This is how any mother would feel.

409
00:23:58,136 --> 00:23:59,596
I'll leave then. Goodbye.

410
00:24:14,861 --> 00:24:15,988
What's the occasion?

411
00:24:16,613 --> 00:24:18,448
Is it to celebrate your new job?

412
00:24:20,867 --> 00:24:22,077
Let's talk after we eat.

413
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:24,955
You got it, right? You got the job.

414
00:24:27,207 --> 00:24:29,668
I knew you would get it. Congratulations.

415
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:31,253
I didn't get it.

416
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,214
What?

417
00:24:35,424 --> 00:24:36,591
I didn't get the job.

418
00:24:40,929 --> 00:24:41,972
Yu-mi.

419
00:24:46,101 --> 00:24:47,561
I want to break up.

420
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:50,522
You should date other men.

421
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,525
I can't do this any longer.

422
00:24:54,026 --> 00:24:55,777
What are you talking about?

423
00:24:56,111 --> 00:24:57,487
Aren't you sick and tired?

424
00:24:57,571 --> 00:25:00,657
"Let's go someplace nice when I get a job.
Let's have an expensive meal then.

425
00:25:00,741 --> 00:25:02,576
We should get matching rings
when I get a job.

426
00:25:02,826 --> 00:25:04,578
Once I get a job, let's do this and that.

427
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:06,330
Once I get a job..."

428
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,083
We've been saying that for three years.

429
00:25:11,001 --> 00:25:13,920
The sooner I let you go,
the better it is for you.

430
00:25:14,796 --> 00:25:16,340
That's the least I can do for you.

431
00:25:16,423 --> 00:25:18,175
That doesn't make any sense.

432
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:20,677
Is it because you didn't get the job?

433
00:25:20,927 --> 00:25:23,680
I understand that it's tough for you.

434
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:29,478
Let's not do this.

435
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:32,856
I'm going to be by your side
whether you get the job or not.

436
00:25:34,524 --> 00:25:37,611
You've been through a lot to date
a guy like me. Thank you.

437
00:25:39,071 --> 00:25:40,197
Thank you.

438
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,492
But when I'm with you,

439
00:25:48,205 --> 00:25:50,916
it makes me feel pathetic and useless.

440
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,794
I can't date you anymore.

441
00:25:59,883 --> 00:26:01,093
I'm sorry. Bye.

442
00:26:01,676 --> 00:26:03,428
Byeong-jae!

443
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:21,905
Hey, Byeong-jae.

444
00:26:22,823 --> 00:26:25,283
I got it. Fine. I'll move out, man!

445
00:26:25,367 --> 00:26:26,493
No.

446
00:26:27,828 --> 00:26:29,996
I wanted to let you know
that I got the rent.

447
00:26:30,664 --> 00:26:32,332
Some girl came by and paid it yesterday.

448
00:26:32,749 --> 00:26:34,751
She paid all the rent you owe
plus this month's.

449
00:26:35,085 --> 00:26:38,296
I think she said her name was Yu-mi.

450
00:27:24,092 --> 00:27:25,427
<i>So I broke up with her.</i>

451
00:27:28,722 --> 00:27:31,516
<i>It was actually my pride that made me
feel pathetic and useless.</i>

452
00:27:33,101 --> 00:27:35,562
<i>I couldn't accept that
and ended up hurting Yu-mi.</i>

453
00:27:39,149 --> 00:27:42,319
<i>She was a really kind girlfriend
who always put me ahead of herself.</i>

454
00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:50,952
Hey, this is so sad.

455
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,416
It's heartbreaking.

456
00:27:58,293 --> 00:28:00,587
Why does love always hurt so much?

457
00:28:03,423 --> 00:28:04,633
If love hurts too much,

458
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,844
it wasn't love.

459
00:28:12,224 --> 00:28:14,559
It sounds like
you've been hurt by love before.

460
00:28:19,564 --> 00:28:21,983
Go on. Embarrass yourself some more.

461
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:23,443
No.

462
00:28:23,777 --> 00:28:24,986
Not me.

463
00:28:26,196 --> 00:28:27,405
I was thinking about my friend.

464
00:28:28,615 --> 00:28:29,533
So tell me.

465
00:28:29,616 --> 00:28:32,327
Is your wish to get back together
with your girlfriend?

466
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:33,286
No.

467
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,541
I didn't get the job.
How could I want that?

468
00:28:37,624 --> 00:28:39,543
Nothing would change
even if we got back together.

469
00:28:39,834 --> 00:28:40,794
Then what is it?

470
00:28:40,877 --> 00:28:43,129
I at least want to know
why I didn't get the job.

471
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:47,842
I thought I did everything I can,
but I don't know what the problem was.

472
00:28:49,844 --> 00:28:52,180
I have to know so that I can try again.

473
00:28:54,474 --> 00:28:56,893
Then, I can go back to Yu-mi
without feeling sorry for myself.

474
00:28:57,769 --> 00:29:00,272
That's simple. It's a piece of cake.

475
00:29:00,897 --> 00:29:02,232
Pardon?

476
00:29:03,316 --> 00:29:04,317
It's nothing.

477
00:29:05,485 --> 00:29:08,780
I want to pour you this drink
to cheer you up.

478
00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:10,657
Take it.

479
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:13,618
Thank you.

480
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:34,681
If I know why,

481
00:29:37,225 --> 00:29:38,560
I'm sure I'll...

482
00:29:46,026 --> 00:29:49,237
Please introduce yourselves in English.

483
00:29:49,779 --> 00:29:51,406
-Mr. Han Kang-bae.
-Yes?

484
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:54,826
Me? Must I do that, too?

485
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:56,578
If you don't want to, why are you here?

486
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,122
Please leave
if you don't want to participate.

487
00:30:00,457 --> 00:30:01,875
INTERVIEWER

488
00:30:03,043 --> 00:30:04,461
No, I'll do it.

489
00:30:06,129 --> 00:30:07,172
Gosh, an introduction...

490
00:30:11,885 --> 00:30:14,095
My name is Kang-bae Han.

491
00:30:16,139 --> 00:30:20,226
I'm fine, thank you.
And you?

492
00:30:22,437 --> 00:30:23,730
His level is elementary.

493
00:30:23,813 --> 00:30:25,649
It's not that bad.
It's easy to understand.

494
00:30:27,066 --> 00:30:28,651
Hello, my name is Byeong-jae Park.

495
00:30:29,068 --> 00:30:32,280
Before we move on any further,
it's an honor to be here.

496
00:30:33,448 --> 00:30:37,494
I graduated from Hankuk University
major in Hotel Management.

497
00:30:37,619 --> 00:30:39,579
While I was in school vacation,

498
00:30:39,996 --> 00:30:43,541
I worked part time at Sangil Hotel
for a short period of time,

499
00:30:43,625 --> 00:30:45,502
and I've gained an enormous experience.

500
00:30:46,002 --> 00:30:50,548
I'm sure I know about Sangil Hotel more
than anyone who's in this room.

501
00:30:51,132 --> 00:30:54,803
I'd like to find an opportunity
to use my career experience

502
00:30:54,886 --> 00:30:56,721
and aptitude from this company.

503
00:30:56,805 --> 00:30:57,889
Thank you.

504
00:31:00,141 --> 00:31:01,059
Awesome.

505
00:31:06,064 --> 00:31:08,483
Hi, I'm Sang-ho Byun.

506
00:31:10,485 --> 00:31:12,070
-Is that all?
-Yes.

507
00:31:17,033 --> 00:31:17,951
Excellent, indeed.

508
00:31:18,034 --> 00:31:21,705
I can sense your confidence
just from a single sentence.

509
00:31:21,788 --> 00:31:24,541
Simple is the best. Yes.

510
00:31:26,459 --> 00:31:30,213
All right. Please tell us
about our hotel's characteristics

511
00:31:30,296 --> 00:31:32,090
and its unique selling points.

512
00:31:32,716 --> 00:31:34,759
Sangil Hotel is the best tourist hotel

513
00:31:34,843 --> 00:31:37,721
that features a casino, water park,
and a full-scale concert venue.

514
00:31:37,804 --> 00:31:40,223
This is an achievement of Sangil Hotel

515
00:31:40,306 --> 00:31:42,892
whose vision is to expand the hotel

516
00:31:42,976 --> 00:31:45,145
into a landmark
for culture, leisure, and entertainment.

517
00:31:45,228 --> 00:31:47,272
As a future employee of Sangil,

518
00:31:47,355 --> 00:31:49,983
I would like to lead tourism and culture.

519
00:31:50,567 --> 00:31:51,443
Thank you.

520
00:31:59,117 --> 00:32:00,034
Well,

521
00:32:01,786 --> 00:32:02,829
I...

522
00:32:05,623 --> 00:32:07,333
I agree with him.

523
00:32:09,502 --> 00:32:11,629
My goodness. What a weirdo.

524
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:15,717
All right. What about you,
Mr. Byun Sang-ho?

525
00:32:16,342 --> 00:32:18,303
I don't know much about the hotel,

526
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,305
but the food here is good.

527
00:32:21,556 --> 00:32:23,683
Who is this idiot?

528
00:32:26,019 --> 00:32:28,688
Impressive, indeed.
He knows what's important.

529
00:32:28,772 --> 00:32:30,023
Of course.

530
00:32:30,523 --> 00:32:34,110
He's the ideal type of person
that Sangil wants to hire.

531
00:32:38,281 --> 00:32:40,241
Something doesn't add up.

532
00:32:40,325 --> 00:32:42,327
He killed that interview.

533
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:45,622
It doesn't matter if he did well.
Those jerks weren't even listening to him.

534
00:32:46,706 --> 00:32:49,501
I heard the other applicants talking
on the phone in the restroom.

535
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:53,213
They said this was only a formality.
They said their parents got them the jobs.

536
00:32:54,464 --> 00:32:58,301
This definitely looks suspicious,
but how deep do you think it goes?

537
00:32:59,427 --> 00:33:02,430
Does Byeong-jae have any other memories
regarding Sangil Hotel?

538
00:33:03,848 --> 00:33:04,933
We need to dig a bit more.

539
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:15,109
Please stop.

540
00:33:15,193 --> 00:33:18,029
I just want to talk to HR
about the interview.

541
00:33:18,613 --> 00:33:20,323
I said no.

542
00:33:20,406 --> 00:33:22,116
<i>The results are out.
Why are you doing this?</i>

543
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,535
What's going on?

544
00:33:24,619 --> 00:33:26,704
He probably wasn't
recruited for the opening.

545
00:33:26,788 --> 00:33:28,456
I don't know if he's dense or naive.

546
00:33:28,706 --> 00:33:30,917
How could he apply
without having a connection?

547
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,127
Why not? You don't need
a connection to get a job here.

548
00:33:33,294 --> 00:33:35,046
Even if he does,

549
00:33:35,129 --> 00:33:37,465
he'll end up breaking his back
and never get promoted.

550
00:33:37,966 --> 00:33:40,802
I heard a son of an assemblyman
was hired this year.

551
00:33:41,302 --> 00:33:44,764
There's more. A prosecutor's daughter and
niece of a newspaper agency's director.

552
00:33:44,848 --> 00:33:46,516
All of them had impressive connections.

553
00:33:46,599 --> 00:33:47,600
All of them?

554
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:52,772
Then, did all the new hires
have connections?

555
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:55,650
So they all got the job based on favors?

556
00:33:55,733 --> 00:33:57,902
They never hired employees
based on grades anyway.

557
00:33:58,403 --> 00:34:00,238
Come on, this isn't your first day here.

558
00:34:02,615 --> 00:34:04,659
But who are you?
I've never seen you around here.

559
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:07,120
I...

560
00:34:07,829 --> 00:34:09,080
<i>The Chairman is coming.</i>

561
00:34:09,163 --> 00:34:10,415
-Hey, let's go.
-Hurry.

562
00:34:14,085 --> 00:34:16,880
Sir! I applied for an entry-level job
this year. I'm Park Byeong-jae.

563
00:34:16,963 --> 00:34:19,549
I would like to know
why I didn't get the job.

564
00:34:20,133 --> 00:34:21,759
I just want to know why I didn't get it.

565
00:34:24,053 --> 00:34:26,973
What is the requirement for passing?

566
00:34:27,056 --> 00:34:28,516
Sir! Please!

567
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,185
He was born a failure.

568
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:32,270
What can I do?

569
00:34:33,605 --> 00:34:35,899
He has no one to blame but his parents.

570
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:43,364
<i>Please! Please I'm begging you.</i>

571
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:45,491
I told you no.

572
00:34:45,575 --> 00:34:47,827
What is all this fuss about
at this late hour?

573
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:53,416
Lord, my mother has been murdered.

574
00:34:54,167 --> 00:34:56,419
Someone set the temple on fire
and stabbed...

575
00:34:57,003 --> 00:34:58,212
Please find the culprit!

576
00:34:59,672 --> 00:35:01,424
Perhaps it happened
because she deserved it.

577
00:35:01,966 --> 00:35:04,052
How could you say such a thing?

578
00:35:04,636 --> 00:35:07,305
An innocent woman was wrongfully murdered.

579
00:35:07,555 --> 00:35:08,640
No.

580
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,267
Not everyone is born equal.

581
00:35:13,603 --> 00:35:17,440
Must my sleep be interrupted
because a mere shaman died?

582
00:35:18,232 --> 00:35:19,067
What?

583
00:35:19,817 --> 00:35:21,069
"A mere shaman"?

584
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:23,863
How can you say that?

585
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:25,823
A woman died.

586
00:35:25,907 --> 00:35:27,617
A woman died!

587
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,160
You bitch.

588
00:35:34,123 --> 00:35:37,293
You have no one to blame
but your ancestors.

589
00:35:37,377 --> 00:35:38,836
Your mother who is low of birth.

590
00:35:39,545 --> 00:35:42,924
And all of her ancestors
that came before her.

591
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:48,388
You shouldn't have been born
in such a vile family.

592
00:35:48,972 --> 00:35:49,806
Am I right?

593
00:35:52,976 --> 00:35:54,686
Don't just stand there.
Get her out of here.

594
00:35:54,769 --> 00:35:55,979
-Yes, lord.
-Yes, lord.

595
00:35:56,062 --> 00:35:58,231
-Get out.
-Let go of me!

596
00:35:58,314 --> 00:36:00,984
-Get out of here.
-Get off me! Let go!

597
00:36:02,443 --> 00:36:04,612
-My gosh. Just get out of here.
-Let go!

598
00:36:07,073 --> 00:36:08,282
-Bitch.
-Goodness.

599
00:36:30,221 --> 00:36:33,558
Hey, wake up. Wake up now.

600
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,106
I must have fallen asleep. I'm sorry.

601
00:36:40,189 --> 00:36:41,190
That's fine.

602
00:36:44,527 --> 00:36:45,611
Do you recognize him?

603
00:36:45,987 --> 00:36:48,990
Yes. He was at the interview with me.

604
00:36:49,073 --> 00:36:51,993
He made a social media post
that he got the job at Sangil.

605
00:36:52,869 --> 00:36:54,787
He got the job?

606
00:36:55,913 --> 00:36:57,040
It makes no sense.

607
00:36:57,123 --> 00:36:59,459
Yes, it does. Why? Look.

608
00:37:00,043 --> 00:37:01,419
He's the son of an assemblyman.

609
00:37:01,502 --> 00:37:05,131
Doesn't it look like his father is chummy
with the chairman of Sangil?

610
00:37:06,299 --> 00:37:08,634
You never had a fair chance at the job.

611
00:37:08,801 --> 00:37:09,886
Do you get it?

612
00:37:10,011 --> 00:37:12,430
No. How could this be?

613
00:37:13,598 --> 00:37:15,349
But Sangil Hotel is a public enterprise.

614
00:37:16,017 --> 00:37:16,851
This makes no sense.

615
00:37:16,934 --> 00:37:18,144
No, it doesn't.

616
00:37:18,436 --> 00:37:21,939
The thing is
that some things in this world

617
00:37:23,149 --> 00:37:24,358
don't make sense.

618
00:37:27,278 --> 00:37:28,196
Then,

619
00:37:29,197 --> 00:37:33,284
you're saying that hundreds of applicants
including myself were just fillers.

620
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:37,455
And I made my parents and my ex-girlfriend

621
00:37:37,538 --> 00:37:39,582
go through all that trouble
when I was just a filler.

622
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:45,254
Byeong-jae, you at least know that
it wasn't because you were lacking.

623
00:37:45,922 --> 00:37:47,048
It'd be better

624
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:52,011
if I wasn't good enough for the job.

625
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,098
To fix this,

626
00:37:55,973 --> 00:37:58,851
I would have to die and be born again.

627
00:38:02,605 --> 00:38:04,816
Why is it so hard to get a goddamn job?

628
00:38:18,788 --> 00:38:20,081
Ms. Weol-ju.

629
00:38:21,207 --> 00:38:22,500
You startled me.

630
00:38:23,126 --> 00:38:24,502
Be ready tomorrow.

631
00:38:24,585 --> 00:38:26,754
Be ready? Be ready for what?

632
00:38:26,838 --> 00:38:29,006
-Sangil Hotel.
-To help Byeong-jae?

633
00:38:29,549 --> 00:38:31,717
What do I need to do?
Just tell me what to do.

634
00:38:31,801 --> 00:38:33,511
You really shouldn't.

635
00:38:33,845 --> 00:38:36,806
If you want him to be punished for it,
we need to secure evidence.

636
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:40,685
You know that we can't solve this problem
by doing a few tricks in the Dream World.

637
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:43,146
Politicians and businessmen
are involved in this, too.

638
00:38:43,729 --> 00:38:46,065
Do you want to turn this country
inside out just to help him?

639
00:38:46,649 --> 00:38:48,067
I don't care who's involved.

640
00:38:48,151 --> 00:38:50,486
I don't care if this country
is turned inside out.

641
00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:52,321
That bastard, Chairman Choi.

642
00:38:53,739 --> 00:38:55,491
I'll deal with him myself.

643
00:38:58,828 --> 00:38:59,871
What are you talking about?

644
00:38:59,954 --> 00:39:01,038
I can't do it.

645
00:39:01,372 --> 00:39:02,623
Please get me another client.

646
00:39:02,707 --> 00:39:04,584
I don't want to waste my talent.

647
00:39:04,667 --> 00:39:05,751
"Waste your talent"?

648
00:39:06,335 --> 00:39:07,962
Have you been working for free?

649
00:39:08,045 --> 00:39:10,798
Have they been paying you
with toilet paper instead of money?

650
00:39:10,965 --> 00:39:12,633
Chairman Choi is a criminal.

651
00:39:13,217 --> 00:39:15,970
The people who really to be protected
are his victims.

652
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:18,347
How can I keep guarding him knowing this?

653
00:39:18,431 --> 00:39:20,766
I cannot work
while cheating my conscience.

654
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:23,019
I can neither eat nor sleep
because of this.

655
00:39:23,102 --> 00:39:24,145
Kang Yeo-rin.

656
00:39:24,228 --> 00:39:27,523
I've been nice to you because you're good.
But you may have the wrong idea.

657
00:39:28,232 --> 00:39:30,776
You're not a police officer,
you're a bodyguard.

658
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:34,322
A bodyguard who protects a client
in exchange for money.

659
00:39:34,405 --> 00:39:37,200
People like Chairman Choi
are our clients and our meal tickets!

660
00:39:37,283 --> 00:39:40,494
-But at least--
-Can you pay for breaching the contract?

661
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,414
Come on.

662
00:39:43,497 --> 00:39:45,541
If you're a professional, act like one.

663
00:39:45,708 --> 00:39:48,377
Don't cause trouble and do your job
until the contract is over.

664
00:39:49,086 --> 00:39:49,921
Got it?

665
00:40:15,029 --> 00:40:16,989
What? I said no interruptions!

666
00:40:38,135 --> 00:40:39,220
Wait,

667
00:40:40,137 --> 00:40:41,222
I didn't order any drinks.

668
00:40:43,224 --> 00:40:45,268
We happen to receive
a very special bottle of liquor.

669
00:40:45,351 --> 00:40:48,187
I brought it here because I personally
wanted to serve you a glass.

670
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:53,776
It's on the house.

671
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:57,029
My gosh.

672
00:40:59,573 --> 00:41:00,574
Is that so?

673
00:41:01,075 --> 00:41:03,369
All right. Why don't I have one?

674
00:41:33,399 --> 00:41:34,400
Hello, sir.

675
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:37,778
Don't you have a meeting this afternoon
with Assemblyman Byun?

676
00:41:38,362 --> 00:41:39,947
Yes. Right.

677
00:41:40,448 --> 00:41:42,033
I needed to grab something.

678
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:47,330
Wait. I don't think I've seen him before.

679
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:49,332
Where's Ms. Kang Yeo-rin?

680
00:41:49,415 --> 00:41:51,000
What? Well,

681
00:41:51,334 --> 00:41:55,046
I see. I heard he's better than her,
so I hired him instead.

682
00:41:55,421 --> 00:41:58,174
Look at him.
Doesn't he look strong and reliable?

683
00:42:02,553 --> 00:42:03,637
Yes, he sure does.

684
00:42:03,721 --> 00:42:06,223
All right. Let's get going.

685
00:42:09,643 --> 00:42:10,895
Hello, sir.

686
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:13,647
Hello. Thank you for your hard work.

687
00:42:23,866 --> 00:42:26,118
Well, let's see.

688
00:42:27,828 --> 00:42:29,330
Which floor

689
00:42:30,373 --> 00:42:31,457
was my office on?

690
00:42:32,166 --> 00:42:33,125
Pardon?

691
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:36,212
I'm sorry. I'll press it for you.

692
00:42:46,514 --> 00:42:48,224
Excuse me.

693
00:42:51,352 --> 00:42:53,104
Where's this onion smell coming from?

694
00:43:12,915 --> 00:43:13,999
Wow.

695
00:43:20,506 --> 00:43:21,340
Oh, my.

696
00:43:21,882 --> 00:43:23,384
Goodness.

697
00:43:26,053 --> 00:43:28,639
By the way, you really look like him.

698
00:43:29,807 --> 00:43:30,683
Right?

699
00:43:31,934 --> 00:43:33,936
But I can't hold this appearance for long.

700
00:43:35,187 --> 00:43:36,021
It drains my energy.

701
00:43:47,658 --> 00:43:48,784
My gosh, it feels tight.

702
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:53,831
-It's amazing, huh?
-I can't believe what I just saw.

703
00:43:55,541 --> 00:43:57,126
By the way, any word from Weol-ju?

704
00:43:57,710 --> 00:44:00,212
No, not yet. Did something happen?

705
00:44:07,136 --> 00:44:10,306
Sir. A suspicious individual
has entered the hotel.

706
00:44:11,474 --> 00:44:13,559
The individual
might be after the VIP list.

707
00:44:13,642 --> 00:44:15,060
What?

708
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:29,909
What is this? Look at this.
What was my security team doing?

709
00:44:41,295 --> 00:44:42,338
Ms. Kang.

710
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:45,883
Browse the security footage
and catch the intruder.

711
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:47,718
Yes, sir.

712
00:44:49,929 --> 00:44:53,015
Could someone have
switched out the flash drive?

713
00:44:53,724 --> 00:44:56,227
-Would you like to check?
-Yes. Give it here.

714
00:45:12,076 --> 00:45:14,119
What? Who's waking him up?

715
00:45:15,913 --> 00:45:17,039
<i>Sir.</i>

716
00:45:17,456 --> 00:45:18,332
<i>Sir!</i>

717
00:45:18,415 --> 00:45:20,125
-Sir
-Yes?

718
00:45:20,209 --> 00:45:21,835
-Sir.
-Hey. You.

719
00:45:23,003 --> 00:45:24,129
Who are you?

720
00:45:24,213 --> 00:45:25,214
And what about you?

721
00:45:25,798 --> 00:45:28,467
He's taking a nap.
You shouldn't wake him up like that.

722
00:45:29,218 --> 00:45:30,553
What did you put in his food?

723
00:45:31,428 --> 00:45:32,263
So what?

724
00:45:32,346 --> 00:45:35,140
He does whatever he wants
with other people's lives.

725
00:45:37,059 --> 00:45:38,852
-Sir. Please wake up.
-Yes.

726
00:45:38,936 --> 00:45:41,105
Seriously? I told you not to wake him up.

727
00:45:45,025 --> 00:45:48,529
Look at you. It's been a while
since I've had a good fight.

728
00:45:48,612 --> 00:45:49,780
What's going on?

729
00:45:50,364 --> 00:45:51,574
Why is it so loud?

730
00:45:51,657 --> 00:45:52,700
-Sir.
-What?

731
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:57,580
Yes. It's in a book.
There's a USB flash drive in the book.

732
00:45:57,663 --> 00:45:59,331
But I couldn't see the title of the book.

733
00:45:59,415 --> 00:46:01,125
He woke up now. So make it quick.

734
00:46:09,466 --> 00:46:10,759
It's not here.

735
00:46:28,152 --> 00:46:29,778
-Goodness.
-Damn it.

736
00:46:29,945 --> 00:46:31,905
Hello, sir. What?

737
00:46:32,948 --> 00:46:35,909
Sir, you went up to your office
just a while ago.

738
00:46:35,993 --> 00:46:38,621
What? Who went up to my office?

739
00:46:38,704 --> 00:46:41,832
You went up to your office, sir.

740
00:46:42,791 --> 00:46:44,043
But here you are again.

741
00:46:44,126 --> 00:46:46,962
What are you talking about?
Send my bodyguards upstairs now.

742
00:46:47,046 --> 00:46:48,088
Okay.

743
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:51,383
My goodness. What's going on?

744
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:01,101
Hey.

745
00:47:02,686 --> 00:47:03,812
I found it.

746
00:47:05,856 --> 00:47:07,191
We found it.

747
00:47:09,985 --> 00:47:11,570
<i>Hey, hurry!</i>

748
00:47:11,654 --> 00:47:12,571
What's that sound?

749
00:47:12,655 --> 00:47:14,281
What should we do now?

750
00:47:14,365 --> 00:47:16,367
-Run.
-Hurry up.

751
00:47:17,993 --> 00:47:19,119
Damn it.

752
00:47:25,751 --> 00:47:27,753
There must have been a misunderstanding.

753
00:47:27,836 --> 00:47:30,172
I came to the wrong room.

754
00:47:30,673 --> 00:47:32,216
Don't just stand there. Get him!

755
00:47:55,781 --> 00:47:57,950
Catch him! Catch him or you're all fired!

756
00:48:05,582 --> 00:48:08,127
My gosh, where did he run off to?

757
00:48:22,850 --> 00:48:24,226
Oh, my gosh!

758
00:48:30,709 --> 00:48:32,085
Oh, my gosh!

759
00:48:34,164 --> 00:48:36,625
Give me back the thing
you stole from this room.

760
00:48:48,887 --> 00:48:50,263
We're on the same side.

761
00:48:51,264 --> 00:48:52,557
My gosh.

762
00:48:52,766 --> 00:48:53,892
I'm sorry!

763
00:48:58,146 --> 00:48:59,606
Where are you going?

764
00:49:15,956 --> 00:49:17,749
-What are you--
-It's okay.

765
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,710
Tell me what's on your mind.

766
00:49:22,712 --> 00:49:24,589
What do you think you're doing?

767
00:49:25,799 --> 00:49:27,425
You just heard a bell ring, didn't you?

768
00:49:29,678 --> 00:49:33,431
It's okay. I'm ready to hear you out.
Go ahead and tell me.

769
00:49:34,516 --> 00:49:36,810
Go on. Go ahead.

770
00:49:36,893 --> 00:49:38,687
What bell, you pervert?

771
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:46,653
What are you doing?
I said you can tell me everything.

772
00:49:46,736 --> 00:49:47,946
Tell you what?

773
00:49:48,989 --> 00:49:50,448
Just give me what you stole.

774
00:49:50,532 --> 00:49:52,409
That's weird.
You're supposed to feel something.

775
00:49:52,993 --> 00:49:55,370
-Didn't you feel anything?
-Cut the crap.

776
00:49:55,453 --> 00:49:57,497
You can't just touch me
all over the place.

777
00:49:58,832 --> 00:49:59,791
No, not there.

778
00:50:02,419 --> 00:50:04,671
Stay still if you don't want
to fracture a bone.

779
00:50:07,007 --> 00:50:09,342
Do you even know what that is?

780
00:50:10,135 --> 00:50:13,555
It's evidence to prove that the chairman
hired people based on connections.

781
00:50:13,638 --> 00:50:16,433
Every new recruit this year was hired
because of their connections.

782
00:50:17,392 --> 00:50:18,810
We're just trying to expose that.

783
00:50:19,394 --> 00:50:21,146
We're doing it for a good cause.

784
00:50:21,229 --> 00:50:22,230
My job

785
00:50:22,897 --> 00:50:25,233
is to protect my client
and his belongings.

786
00:50:26,985 --> 00:50:29,696
<i>Ms. Kang, we lost the guy. What about you?</i>

787
00:50:29,779 --> 00:50:31,239
-I just--
-Is it okay to ruin

788
00:50:31,323 --> 00:50:33,074
people's lives as long as you get paid?

789
00:50:33,575 --> 00:50:36,703
Are you willing to ruin lives
just so that you can protect your client?

790
00:50:37,245 --> 00:50:39,456
A guy who graduated from college
as the top student

791
00:50:39,831 --> 00:50:42,584
got a perfect score on the entrance exam,

792
00:50:42,667 --> 00:50:45,253
and earned multiple qualifications
but he still wasn't hired.

793
00:50:47,505 --> 00:50:49,549
He was born a failure.

794
00:50:49,632 --> 00:50:50,633
What can I do?

795
00:50:51,843 --> 00:50:54,179
He has no one to blame but his parents.

796
00:50:54,679 --> 00:50:57,140
-Chairman, sir!
-<i>He was fooled by the chairman.</i>

797
00:50:57,682 --> 00:50:59,476
He wasted years of his life

798
00:50:59,559 --> 00:51:01,102
and lost someone he loved.

799
00:51:01,811 --> 00:51:05,273
Is it your job to make sure that his life
remains in ruins?

800
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:08,318
Are you going to let the chairman
continue to ruin

801
00:51:08,401 --> 00:51:10,612
thousands of other people's lives?
Is that your job?

802
00:51:12,447 --> 00:51:13,490
<i>Ms. Kang.</i>

803
00:51:13,907 --> 00:51:14,908
<i>Ms. Kang.</i>

804
00:51:15,241 --> 00:51:17,035
With that, we can set things straight.

805
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:19,829
Please help us.

806
00:51:44,312 --> 00:51:45,939
Are you giving me this?

807
00:51:46,648 --> 00:51:47,899
You're going to let us do this?

808
00:51:53,071 --> 00:51:54,155
Thank you.

809
00:51:57,826 --> 00:51:58,993
Hey.

810
00:52:03,498 --> 00:52:06,042
There's a stairway for employees
on the far left of the corridor.

811
00:52:07,043 --> 00:52:08,461
Use that to open the door.

GANG HAN GUARD
KANG YEO-RIN

813
00:52:29,232 --> 00:52:30,400
He's over there! Get him!

814
00:52:30,483 --> 00:52:31,443
Over here to the left!

815
00:52:33,069 --> 00:52:34,946
Kang-bae, get in.

816
00:52:36,322 --> 00:52:37,323
Hey, stop!

817
00:52:38,032 --> 00:52:38,992
Hurry up!

818
00:52:42,078 --> 00:52:43,079
Stop!

819
00:52:43,746 --> 00:52:44,873
Damn it.

820
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:47,292
<i>Did you really hire people unfairly?</i>

821
00:52:47,375 --> 00:52:48,585
<i>How many did you hire unfairly?</i>

822
00:52:48,668 --> 00:52:51,504
<i>What are you talking about?
It's all a lie!</i>

823
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:53,631
<i>It's slander! It's a lie!</i>

824

SANGIL RAISES SUSPICIONS
OF UNFAIR RECRUITMENT

825
00:53:05,059 --> 00:53:09,105
President Choi,
how could you let this go public?

826
00:53:09,189 --> 00:53:12,484
I will hold you responsible if I don't
get elected because of this.

827
00:53:12,567 --> 00:53:15,278
This is very upsetting.

828
00:53:15,361 --> 00:53:19,491
You talked as if we were a family
when you asked me for favors.

829
00:53:19,991 --> 00:53:23,119
As much as this is
a difficult situation for all of us,

830
00:53:23,203 --> 00:53:25,997
we should team up like a true family.

831
00:53:28,082 --> 00:53:29,292
Don't you agree, sir?

832
00:53:30,543 --> 00:53:32,086
I'll try to do what I can.

833
00:53:32,921 --> 00:53:35,006
My grandson will be working there.

834
00:53:35,089 --> 00:53:37,592
I can't let the company's reputation
go down the drain like this.

835
00:53:37,675 --> 00:53:39,344
Thank you, sir.

836
00:53:39,552 --> 00:53:41,262
Yes, of course.

837
00:53:43,389 --> 00:53:44,599
Hey, it's me.

838
00:53:45,433 --> 00:53:48,978
About the Sangil's
unfair recruitment issue...

839
00:53:49,062 --> 00:53:50,688
Let's just cover it up.

840
00:53:51,648 --> 00:53:54,901
Just say some guy who didn't get the job
got angry and made up a lie

841
00:53:54,984 --> 00:53:56,444
to get back at the company.

842
00:53:56,528 --> 00:53:59,197
Yes, that ought to do it. Okay.

843
00:54:02,617 --> 00:54:06,287
Loyalty is thicker than blood.

844
00:54:06,454 --> 00:54:08,998
This is what families are all about,
right?

845
00:54:10,458 --> 00:54:12,794
Here you go. Drink up, everyone.

846
00:54:12,877 --> 00:54:13,920
Cheers.

847
00:54:42,198 --> 00:54:43,157
My goodness.

Yes! I sent it!

Good job.

857

<i>who were suspected to be involved

867

What is this?

868
00:55:56,606 --> 00:55:58,900
Damn it! Who recorded this?

869
00:55:58,983 --> 00:56:00,777
Where's the camera? Find it right now!

870
00:56:00,985 --> 00:56:03,237
What should we do?

871
00:56:04,864 --> 00:56:06,658
<i>The investigation team arrested</i>

<i>Chairman Choi

873

INCOMING CALL

878
00:56:24,217 --> 00:56:25,051
Hello?

879
00:56:25,134 --> 00:56:28,262
<i>Hello, this is Sangil Hotel's Audit Team.
Are you Mr. Park Byeong-jae?</i>

880
00:56:28,346 --> 00:56:29,180
Yes.

881
00:56:30,390 --> 00:56:31,224
That's me.

882
00:56:31,307 --> 00:56:33,893
<i>First, we'd like to apologize
for the unfair treatment you received</i>

883
00:56:33,976 --> 00:56:35,478
<i>during the recruitment process.</i>

884
00:56:35,728 --> 00:56:39,565
<i>We noticed that you didn't get hired
even though you got the highest score.</i>

885
00:56:39,691 --> 00:56:40,858
<i>Therefore, HR has decided</i>

886
00:56:40,942 --> 00:56:43,736
<i>to hire you right away
without any additional requirements.</i>

887
00:56:53,746 --> 00:56:54,872
-Here.
-Okay.

888
00:56:57,333 --> 00:56:58,251
It's delicious.

889
00:57:00,503 --> 00:57:01,963
Do you see that?

890
00:57:02,588 --> 00:57:04,716
I worked so hard to get him a job.

891
00:57:04,799 --> 00:57:06,342
But he's eating at another restaurant.

892
00:57:06,801 --> 00:57:08,720
Humans are unbelievable.

893
00:57:09,053 --> 00:57:11,806
Cut him some slack.
You know why he wanted to eat there.

894
00:57:13,307 --> 00:57:14,851
I have to say, I'm jealous.

895
00:57:15,017 --> 00:57:17,353
They're able to connect with each other

896
00:57:17,645 --> 00:57:19,397
just by holding hands.

897
00:57:20,189 --> 00:57:21,399
Why are you jealous?

898
00:57:21,482 --> 00:57:24,360
You can get people to open up to you
with even the slightest touch.

899
00:57:24,444 --> 00:57:25,903
That's not what he meant.

900
00:57:26,028 --> 00:57:28,990
He just wants to hold hands with a woman.

901
00:57:29,824 --> 00:57:30,825
Oh, I see.

902
00:57:33,244 --> 00:57:35,246
No, that wasn't my point.

903
00:57:35,329 --> 00:57:39,000
I'm jealous that they can connect
without even having to talk.

904
00:57:39,333 --> 00:57:42,545
People I come into contact with
tell me way too much.

905
00:57:51,304 --> 00:57:54,640
But there are only seven more people to go
until I'm cured.

906
00:57:55,349 --> 00:57:56,267
Right, Ms. Weol-ju?

907
00:57:56,350 --> 00:57:57,310
Of course.

908
00:57:57,894 --> 00:57:59,729
Hang in there, Kang-bae.

909
00:58:01,189 --> 00:58:05,151
If you want to hold hands,
you can hold mine.

910
00:58:06,569 --> 00:58:07,445
Should we lock fingers?

911
00:58:08,279 --> 00:58:11,657
No, it's okay. No.

912
00:58:12,784 --> 00:58:13,743
I'm not that desperate.

913
00:58:13,826 --> 00:58:15,703
Why? You look very desperate.

914
00:58:15,787 --> 00:58:17,830
-Come here. I'll hold your hand.
-No, it's okay.

915
00:58:17,914 --> 00:58:20,541
-Kang-bae.
-Look at Ms. Weol-ju!

916
00:58:21,417 --> 00:58:23,044
Oh, my gosh.

917
00:58:23,669 --> 00:58:24,670
Are you okay?

918
00:58:24,962 --> 00:58:26,130
I'll hold your hand.

919
00:58:26,339 --> 00:58:28,674
<i>When you run a race,</i>

920
00:58:28,758 --> 00:58:31,469
<i>you either come in first, second, or last.</i>

921
00:58:31,803 --> 00:58:35,223
<i>But it's important to have a fair start.</i>

922
00:58:35,973 --> 00:58:40,061
<i>But you suffered because of those
who used money and power</i>

923
00:58:40,144 --> 00:58:41,687
<i>to get a head start.</i>

924
00:58:42,688 --> 00:58:45,691
<i>I bet you think it's all over
now that you got a job.</i>

925
00:58:45,817 --> 00:58:47,819
<i>But this is only the beginning.</i>

926
00:58:48,736 --> 00:58:51,364
<i>I hope you survive in this jungle.</i>

927
00:58:51,656 --> 00:58:54,742
<i>You and your girlfriend
should support each other...</i>

928
00:58:54,826 --> 00:58:57,954
<i>Or not. Whatever.</i>

929
00:58:58,996 --> 00:59:01,457
Gosh, they need to take it down a notch.

930
00:59:01,541 --> 00:59:04,001
They should just get a room.

931
00:59:04,085 --> 00:59:06,003
Whatever. They're on their own now.

932
00:59:07,713 --> 00:59:09,507
Hey! Wait for me!

933
00:59:19,559 --> 00:59:25,439
<i>You were born to peel onions</i>

934
00:59:25,565 --> 00:59:31,153
<i>You are always peeling onions
throughout your entire life</i>

935
00:59:32,446 --> 00:59:34,156
Kang-bae, what are you doing?

936
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:36,325
Get ready for business.
Don't zone out like that.

937
00:59:39,745 --> 00:59:40,705
What's this?

938
00:59:42,039 --> 00:59:44,041
GANG HAN GUARD
KANG YEO-RIN

939
00:59:44,125 --> 00:59:45,793
Oh, right. I need to return this.

940
00:59:46,377 --> 00:59:47,295
What?

941
00:59:47,962 --> 00:59:49,171
Oh, the bodyguard?

942
00:59:49,255 --> 00:59:51,257
Yes, I never even got to thank her.

943
00:59:52,258 --> 00:59:54,594
It'll be dangerous to go back
to the hotel, right?

944
00:59:54,677 --> 00:59:56,971
If you want to get stabbed, just tell me.

945
00:59:57,054 --> 00:59:58,764
There's no need to go all the way there.

946
00:59:59,390 --> 01:00:01,017
Exactly. I shouldn't go.

947
01:00:02,268 --> 01:00:04,520
By the way,
I had a really weird experience.

948
01:00:04,604 --> 01:00:08,357
I had a lot of physical contact
with that bodyguard, but she was fine.

949
01:00:08,441 --> 01:00:09,984
Nothing happened after she touched you?

950
01:00:10,067 --> 01:00:11,402
Are you sure?

951
01:00:11,485 --> 01:00:12,695
Yes, I'm serious.

952
01:00:12,778 --> 01:00:16,157
She touched here, here, and here...

953
01:00:19,243 --> 01:00:21,829
Anyway, I've never met
someone like her before.

954
01:00:21,913 --> 01:00:25,291
Maybe she's just free of worries.
She might not have had anything to say.

955
01:00:28,377 --> 01:00:29,295
Do you think so?

956
01:00:30,296 --> 01:00:31,672
GANG HAN GUARD
KANG YEO-RIN

957
01:00:31,756 --> 01:00:35,134
Cheers to Kang Yeo-rin,
the apostle of justice!

958
01:00:40,932 --> 01:00:42,183
Apostle of justice, my ass.

959
01:00:42,266 --> 01:00:43,893
More like the apostle of unemployment.

960
01:00:43,976 --> 01:00:47,647
Who knew they would have
the security footage of me letting him go?

961
01:00:47,730 --> 01:00:48,898
I got fired right away.

962
01:00:49,982 --> 01:00:52,276
You're competent enough
to find another job elsewhere.

963
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:54,195
You don't know what you're talking about.

964
01:00:55,029 --> 01:00:58,032
They say I'm the bodyguard
who sent her client to jail.

965
01:00:58,115 --> 01:01:00,826
My name is on the very top
of this industry's blacklist.

966
01:01:01,953 --> 01:01:03,996
I have nowhere to go.

967
01:01:04,580 --> 01:01:06,457
Darn it. I must've been crazy.

968
01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:08,250
If it weren't for that guy...

969
01:01:08,751 --> 01:01:10,002
Was he handsome?

970
01:01:10,336 --> 01:01:12,755
-If he was able to convince you--
-No way.

971
01:01:12,838 --> 01:01:15,591
He looked so common, and he's so clumsy.

972
01:01:16,092 --> 01:01:18,844
He's nowhere near my type. Never.

973
01:01:19,553 --> 01:01:22,014
You've never even dated anyone before.

974
01:01:22,390 --> 01:01:24,976
You might not know your type yet.

975
01:01:26,060 --> 01:01:27,895
Why do you have to hurt me like that?

976
01:01:27,979 --> 01:01:30,064
Weren't you here to console me?

977
01:01:31,148 --> 01:01:32,316
Sorry.

978
01:01:33,067 --> 01:01:36,237
But I'm still very proud of you.

979
01:01:36,779 --> 01:01:38,864
You saved so many people's lives.

980
01:01:40,533 --> 01:01:43,244
I saved other people's lives
only to ruin mine.

981
01:01:43,953 --> 01:01:46,330
All my life, all I've ever done
was sports and martial arts.

982
01:01:46,956 --> 01:01:50,042
How am I going to make a living
now that I can no longer be a bodyguard?

983
01:01:50,126 --> 01:01:51,585
I really have no idea.

984

KAPEUL MART

985
01:01:59,635 --> 01:02:02,888
Why can't I get a refund?

986
01:02:02,972 --> 01:02:05,433
I bought this two days ago!

987
01:02:06,392 --> 01:02:09,395
I'm sorry, sir. You lost the receipt,
so we need to check--

988
01:02:09,478 --> 01:02:11,981
Do you think I'm lying?

989
01:02:12,064 --> 01:02:13,774
Do I need to get aggressive with you?

990
01:02:15,317 --> 01:02:17,611
I didn't want to do this,
but you're making me get physical.

991
01:02:22,867 --> 01:02:24,368
You darn little...

992
01:02:52,865 --> 01:02:58,742

People who won lotteries
after they dreamed of their ancestors

997
01:03:24,970 --> 01:03:27,556
are all descendants of the people
who won the Lottery Battle.

998
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:29,975
My dear, your suffering is over at last.

999
01:03:30,059 --> 01:03:31,644
My goodness gracious.

1000
01:03:31,727 --> 01:03:34,021
Choi Jin-dong is going to die?

1001
01:03:34,105 --> 01:03:35,981
Weol-ju, you're the only one
who can help--

1002
01:03:36,107 --> 01:03:38,526
I'm on a tight schedule myself.

1003
01:03:38,609 --> 01:03:41,028
I'm not a philanthropist
with time on my hands.

1004

<i>Gosh, this is bad. We don't have time.</i>

<i>I'll stop Death from the outside.</i>

1006

<i>You stay inside
and keep an eye on Choi Jin-dong.</i>

-What's going on?
-<i>One more written apology won't hurt.</i>

1008
01:03:49,995 --> 01:03:50,913
<i>You asked for it.</i>

1009
01:03:51,705 --> 01:03:53,833
<i>No!</i>

1010
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,210
<i>Don't go.</i>
