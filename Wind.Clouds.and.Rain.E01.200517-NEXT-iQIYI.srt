1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,535
<i>Episode 1</i>

2
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:15,905
<i>1862 (King Cheoljong's 13 year reign)</i>

3
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:20,115
<i>Ja-Young Min
Future Empress Myeongseong</i>

4
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:26,585
Min Ja-Young.

5
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,895
This child seems...

6
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:42,735
foolish and pitiful to you?

7
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:50,605
That means,
there is someone behind him

8
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:56,915
who dares to fool even
the most dreadful Regent Heungseon.

9
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:00,085
Who is it?

10
00:01:00,589 --> 00:01:04,255
Can you see him
through your clairvoyance?

11
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,969
<i>This person has such a power</i>

12
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,235
that even a great Shaman like me
has never seen.

13
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:19,035
<i>Certainly, she will find
my Lord's hidden enemy.</i>

14
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,825
Soon, he will show up,

15
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:46,835
the man your majesty fears,

16
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:53,875
to this very place.

17
00:02:15,629 --> 00:02:17,325
Capture Choi Chun-Jung!

18
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:22,569
I will greatly reward
whomever is successful!

19
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:23,569
<i>Ha-Eung Lee
Prince Heungseon</i>

20
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:24,535
<i>Yes, my Lord!</i>

21
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:44,325
Who might you be?

22
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,925
I have some business...

23
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,395
with the lady inside.

24
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,635
Let me see her face.

25
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,335
How dare you ask of
such a thing?

26
00:02:58,610 --> 00:02:59,705
Arrest him!

27
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:02,705
Enough!

28
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,455
But my lady!

29
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:21,325
If you see my face,
it'll cost you your life...

30
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:26,095
Are you still willing?

31
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,565
<i>You should not, my lady.</i>

32
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,735
Move aside.

33
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,905
My lady!

34
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:15,845
You are...

35
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:23,325
the woman…
I have been looking for.

36
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,705
I will help you recollect me.

37
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,805
From now on I will never...

38
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:44,505
Lose you nor
let you leave me again.

39
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,135
What have you done to Bong-Ryun?

40
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,575
I cannot answer.

41
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:20,045
Let her go.

42
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:36,165
I'm sorry.

43
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:12,855
You still like to watch
the birds flying,

44
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,465
<i>just like back then.</i>

45
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:25,275
Back then?

46
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,805
Do you...

47
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,945
know me?

48
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:37,345
It's more than I just know you.

49
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:42,455
Everything you see here,
is the result of trying to redeem you.

50
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,155
<i>You are...</i>

51
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:50,265
the love of my life.

52
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:53,965
Your Love?

53
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:19,059
You do not remember me
because of memory blocking poison.

54
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,059
<i>Mihonsan
A psychoactive drug that causes dizziness</i>

55
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,355
It is the cause of your pain, too.

56
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,365
We must cure it.

57
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,635
Or else you will lose
your sight.

58
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:43,549
You…
How will I know if you are

59
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:46,485
trying to cure me
from this poison

60
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,129
or to harm me with another?

61
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,225
3 days...

62
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,055
please give me 3 days,

63
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:56,665
and I will have you remember me.

64
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:00,665
And if I can't still remember you?

65
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:03,965
I'll let you go.

66
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:07,375
To wherever you desire.

67
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:14,375
Now, will you listen to
what I have to say?

68
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:26,025
<i>Ganghwa Island</i>

69
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,249
Look, it's young Lord Chun-Jung!

70
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,905
The first place in the state exam
at 17 years old!

71
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:48,389
He's just like a Prince
from a story book!

72
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:49,245
<i>Chun-Jung Choi</i>

73
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,715
<i>Bong-Ryun Lee</i>

74
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,835
<i>In-Gyu Chae</i>

75
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,469
Father, your son Choi Chun-Jung,

76
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:38,169
I return with the first place
in the state exam.

77
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:38,999
What an excessive title and
honor considering your inadequacy.

78
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,295
<i>Kyung Choi</i>

79
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:47,405
Put the King's grace to
your heart and behave humbly.

80
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:51,505
Yes, Father.

81
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,245
Hew... a day like this could do
better with warm words.

82
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:03,755
Our master is
always tougher on his son.

83
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:08,155
Young Lord, congratulations!

84
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:10,695
Congratulations! My applause!

85
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,895
Here now, get up!

86
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:24,905
<i>Ban-Dal (Shaman)</i>

87
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,115
Here!

88
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,055
Have some soup as well.
It goes down better.

89
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:37,855
Yes.

90
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,595
You have some good news?

91
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:47,395
Actually, I saw
young Lord Chun-Jung today.

92
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:50,009
That's why you've been
smiling all day!

93
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:54,405
I have not!
I just thought of something funny.

94
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:59,619
You are still too young to desire
a handsome guy too much!

95
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,715
It's not like that.

96
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:07,055
Mom, young Lord Chun-Jung
is different.

97
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,625
It's as if he shines... somehow.

98
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,455
<i>I can't really read him like
I do with others, but...</i>

99
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,795
He just shines.

100
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,295
Amazing, huh?

101
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:24,005
You do remember what I told you?!

102
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:29,279
you cannot let others know

103
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,175
that you can see people's futures.

104
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:38,185
But it is also a curse
if people find out about your gift.

105
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:45,085
You can never reveal
your abilities to others!

106
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,695
Yes, I will never.

107
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,995
Don't worry mother.

108
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:15,825
You!

109
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:19,195
<i>You're the daughter of
Shaman Ban-Dal?</i>

110
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,995
I saw you when your mother was
performing rituals for my family

111
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,395
Yes, young Lord of the Chae Clan.

112
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:28,099
My memory was correct,
you are quite pretty.

113
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,405
Follow me.

114
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:31,305
Excuse me?

115
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:35,109
I will be spending my afternoon
shooting some arrows,

116
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:37,205
but no girl servant is available.

117
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:39,615
You will have to attend
to my needs today.

118
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:47,885
Sorry my Lord, but I am tasked with
delivering medicine to the doctor's.

119
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:49,485
Please find someone else.

120
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,195
What are you doing!

121
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,895
What's in there?

122
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:03,509
<i>Pick it up.</i>

123
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,335
This will be to your graceful benefit.

124
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:08,705
Follow me.

125
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:19,615
I have no intention of
entertaining young Lords!

126
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:24,225
Does this bitch wish to die?

127
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,705
She still has not
learned her lesson, yet.

128
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:43,275
Take another shot.

129
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,245
My Lord...
What if I make a mistake?

130
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,185
I said take another shot!

131
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:52,915
Yes, sir!

132
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,465
<i>Please stop!</i>

133
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:19,719
What do you think you're doing?
Stop at once!

134
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,975
Wow... the first-place winner
has arrived.

135
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:24,815
<i>My dearest friend has visited.</i>

136
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,155
Go on, take the shot.

137
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:30,829
I said stop!

138
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,425
<i>Relax my friend.</i>

139
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,525
We're just jesting.

140
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:36,725
Did you not hear my order?

141
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:40,195
I said take the shot.

142
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,575
Sir!

143
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:07,825
Release the child
and take her home.

144
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:10,965
Yes, my Lord!

145
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,875
<i>Trying to kill someone?</i>

146
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,049
Are you okay?

147
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:24,875
Hurry! Get her down!

148
00:16:38,129 --> 00:16:40,125
<i>- Brother.
- Hey, Chun-Jung!</i>

149
00:16:40,129 --> 00:16:42,264
- Top of the exam?
- Congratulations!

150
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:44,469
<i>Well done.</i>

151
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,269
<i>Let us go.</i>

152
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:47,764
Let us go for drinks.

153
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:24,705
<i>Wow. A wild ginseng!</i>

154
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:38,245
A whole patch of wild ginseng!

155
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,085
Thank you, mountain spirit!

156
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:17,789
Brother Chun-Jung.

157
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:21,859
Shouldn't there be a prize for
whomever catches the nine tailed fox?

158
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,029
Sure!

159
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:25,769
Whoever catches it, I will treat
him like a big brother for a month!

160
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:27,999
Yey!
Hey, I'll catch it first!

161
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,465
Let me go!

162
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:34,979
Over there!

163
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,309
Let's go!

164
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:37,875
Take me too!

165
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,769
Oh, shit... that leads to
the field of Wild ginseng!

166
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:57,865
What if they step all over them?

167
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:02,565
Why is Lord Chun-Jung
with them anyways!

168
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:13,215
<i>It's not here.</i>

169
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,715
<i>Where is it?</i>

170
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,715
I heard it here...

171
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,385
Where is it?

172
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,819
The nine-tailed fox!

173
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,519
Run, run away!

174
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,285
- Take me with you!
- It's the nine tailed fox!

175
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,695
Chun-Jung!

176
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,165
In-Gyu!

177
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,265
In-Gyu!

178
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,205
<i>Give me your hand!</i>

179
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,715
Lift me up!

180
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:11,895
<i>Just fall...</i>

181
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:17,205
<i>Fall and perish!
Just disappear!</i>

182
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:25,005
<i>In-Gyu!</i>

183
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,185
I'll go get the help.

184
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:33,685
You should hold on meanwhile.

185
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:37,385
In-Gyu?

186
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:43,595
In-Gyu!

187
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,665
In-Gyu!

188
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,105
In-Gyu!

189
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:26,905
Come on!
Use your strength!

190
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,495
<i>So, what you're saying is,</i>

191
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,909
you're the nine tailed fox that
pushed me down the mountain?

192
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:00,905
That is not true.

193
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:04,109
It is you and the young Lords
who almost ruined my ginseng field

194
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:06,815
and I'm the one who pulled you up
from the cliff and saved your life.

195
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,515
Well...

196
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,615
You sure speak well
for such a small girl.

197
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:16,725
By the way, how did you
manipulate the fireflies?

198
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:20,355
I don't know.
I was just born with it.

199
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:22,665
You are a mystery.

200
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:24,725
Very peculiar
since the first time I saw you.

201
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:29,305
Excuse me?
You've seen me before?

202
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:31,209
The day I was returning
from my exam,

203
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:33,605
were you not watching me
under your dirt basket?

204
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:38,005
You were shining then too,

205
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,475
as if fireflies were all around you.

206
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:51,525
Thank you.

207
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,065
Just tell me what you want,
I shall repay my debt.

208
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:16,449
<i>Thanks to your acting out</i>

209
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:19,555
a great hunter that night,
many young masters got injured!

210
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,119
Stop acting irrationally!

211
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,555
Never to stand out, and always
press down your wild temper!

212
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:25,229
My apologies, sir.

213
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:28,925
You are grounded for 3 days.
Copy all the books I left in the study!

214
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:30,625
This is your punishment!

215
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:58,629
A lowly brat like you
does not even bow?

216
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:00,125
You wish to be punished again?

217
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:02,525
Just fall.

218
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:04,225
What?

219
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:09,535
Just fall, fall and perish.

220
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:13,935
Those were your words.

221
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,345
I saw everything.

222
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:18,205
<i>Just fall.</i>

223
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:23,845
In-Gyu? In-Gyu!

224
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,685
What the hell are you talking about?

225
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:32,325
Fortunately, Lord Chun-Jung is safe.

226
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:35,725
Should I let him know?

227
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:38,425
That you didn't try to get help?

228
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,335
Listen,

229
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:46,039
if you ever bully the weak again,

230
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,035
I will tell him everything!

231
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:52,975
Even all your darkest
thoughts hiding deep in you!

232
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:55,845
How dare you!

233
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,915
Loser...

234
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:46,595
I am here to see Choi Chun-Jung
at your residence.

235
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:49,369
Here to see my Master?

236
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:51,939
You crazy! Come here!

237
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,479
Ouch!

238
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,935
<i>Let her in, please.</i>

239
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:00,545
She is my guest.

240
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:37,345
<i>You...</i>

241
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,355
Why did you ask for such a wish?

242
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:47,795
Because you just can't see anything.

243
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:49,295
Pardon?

244
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:53,465
I was just curious,
since you're so different.

245
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:57,465
I am not any different.

246
00:27:58,170 --> 00:27:59,535
I am just like
all the others around me.

247
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:06,149
Reading all these and writing out
copies you say this is average?

248
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:08,715
17 years old, first place in the state exam?
This isn't ordinary.

249
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:12,519
Young Lord,
you are definitely different.

250
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:15,555
No, I am not really
any different than others!

251
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,355
I even...

252
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:21,595
Yes, play the drums!

253
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:24,965
Excuse me?

254
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:31,065
Without my Father's knowledge,
I play the drums and sing…

255
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:35,535
This is the secret,
music is my true passion!

256
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:41,645
Perhaps this is destiny?

257
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:42,989
What?

258
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:45,045
This is not a secret for me, but...

259
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,755
I dance, too.

260
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,655
Huh?

261
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:52,115
Turn around.

262
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,585
I said turn around.

263
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:25,345
If you see that hair ribbon tied up
here, it's a sign that I'm coming.

264
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:28,755
You can see it from far away,
so you better come as well.

265
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:33,655
If I have time, I guess I can.

<i>Byung-Woon Kim (Minister of Finance)</i>

276
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:30,305
Is this the Shaman who cursed
our town governor and all our Lords?

277
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:34,375
Yes, sir.
These are the amulets for cursing.

278
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:38,745
<i>A Shaman's curse...</i>

279
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:40,455
Start interrogation.

280
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:44,085
You witch!

281
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:48,099
Why have you buried these amulets
right in front of our government office?

282
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,895
They are not for cursing, sir!

283
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:54,669
They are the good luck charms
I made

284
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:56,669
when I prayed and summoned
Lord Chae's ancestors.

285
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:59,335
We have a witness to
your conniving crimes!

286
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:01,639
Who is it?

287
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,509
He would be the one entrapping me!

<i>Silence!

Sir! My Lord!

292
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:29,739
She wrote that amulet
for the Lord Chae's father

293
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,639
<i>as my mother knew
he would pass away!</i>

294

<i>Who the hell is she?</i>

296
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,149

00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:39,445
<i>Wait.</i>

298
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:40,614
Sir?

299
00:33:46,019 --> 00:33:47,419
<i>So?</i>

300
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:51,324
Your mother has such psychic powers
enough to predict someone's death?

301
00:33:52,229 --> 00:33:53,295
Yes, my Lord.

302
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:17,445
Okay then. Predict correctly
and I will grant you your life.

Sir?

304
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:22,485
Put a knife to her throat.

305
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:24,125
Yes, sir!

306
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:35,299
Make your prediction, you Shaman.

307
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:38,635
Will I kill you or let you live?

<i>Do not utter a word!</i>

00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:57,925
You can't even tell me
your own death a second away.

312
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:01,125
What a useless Shaman.
Let me tell you your own future.

313
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:13,575
You are the one who perishes!

314
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:25,915
My mother's life
is not destined to end today.

315
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:30,189
However... your life I am afraid
will end around midnight today.

- Stop!
- Yes, yes sir.

319
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:54,575
So, you are the one with
the real gift, not your mother?

320
00:35:57,950 --> 00:36:00,115
How interesting!

321
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:05,725
Let us see if I die tonight.

322
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:10,225
Until then...
I will keep you both alive.

323
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:50,039
Did you not say that I die tonight?

324
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:54,375
Midnight is upon us
and I am still breathing?

325
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:59,675
Oh, I am too scared to
keep on drinking...

326
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,475
When will I die?

327
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:05,145
If I let you live,

328
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:10,185
You must keep your promise of

329
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:13,259
releasing my mother!

330
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:14,925
You, insolent bitch!

331
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:23,165
Oh, no.
The last bell has just rung now.

332
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:28,675
Your mother will die
because of your bluff.

333
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:43,955
Bitch!

334
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:54,835
<i>You can never reveal
your abilities to others!</i>

335
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,319
<i>Enemies! Get them!</i>

336
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:11,815
<i>Get them!</i>

337
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,369
How dare you who are you!

338
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:24,965
Lord, are you alright?

339
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:29,665
As I promised, it is midnight, now.

340
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:33,335
How is this possible?

341
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:37,345
There was a death written all over
your face and the governor's face.

342
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:41,845
But after I have arrived,
it has disappeared from your face

343
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,945
meaning that you have avoided
death at my hands.

344
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:53,055
What a miraculous child!

345
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,855
Now please let my mother go!

346
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:03,265
I have discovered a real treasure!

347
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:06,535
Imprison this child.

348
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,939
We have much use of her!

349
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:12,309
Let's go!

350
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:13,849
What are you doing?

351
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:16,315
You must keep your word!

352
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:18,589
Let go of me!

353
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:21,115
<i>You must keep your word!</i>

354
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,955
<i>Let go of me!</i>

356
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:44,775

359
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:55,859
Mother...

360
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,955
Bong-Ryun!

361
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,155
Mother!

362
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:05,165
Bong-Ryun!

<i>Bong-Ryun!</i>

364
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:39,065
<i>Princess?</i>

365
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:43,169
This lowborn daughter of a Shaman

366
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:44,009
<i>Jwa-Keun Kim (Prime minister)</i>

367
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:45,365
is a princess, you say?

368
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:52,549
when I was younger,
I shared the bed with her in Gang-Hwa

369
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:54,079
<i>Cheoljong (25th King of the Joseon Dynasty)</i>

370
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:58,049
If so, she would have
brought her child to you already.

371
00:40:58,050 --> 00:40:59,489
<i>Byung-Woon Kim (Minister of Finance)</i>

372
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:02,385
<i>Why would she raise
a child on her own until now?</i>

373
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:05,829
I did not know the young Lord
back then

374
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:06,729
<i>Ban-Dal (Shaman)</i>

375
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:09,225
had become a King.

376
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:12,595
<i>How could I have imagined?</i>

377
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:17,335
After losing my daughter to a master,

378
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:22,005
I returned back to my village
to seek help from her father.

379
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:25,005
That is when I found out you
had become King.

380
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:29,719
At the time,
I was just a meager poor noble,

381
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,989
but still my status prohibited me
from marrying a Shaman.

382
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:35,685
<i>As she left the village
after giving birth to my child,</i>

383
00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:38,255
I never heard back from her again.

384
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:43,195
I am sorry
I did not seek you out

385
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:45,195
My King!

386
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,995
Please help me
get my daughter back!

387
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:52,505
<i>Taking her back?</i>

388
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:05,219
We can compensate you for giving
birth and raising the King's daughter.

389

<i>Queen Hyoyu, Mrs. Jo</i>

390

But now she belongs
to the Royal Family.

391
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:09,985
She cannot be the daughter of
a low birth like you anymore!

392
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:11,585
Pardon me?

393
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:16,095
I know you have risked
your life coming here but...

394
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:23,595
What could you possibly offer
your daughter as a mother?

395
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:28,405
<i>As Kim family at Jangdong
will take great care of the princess,</i>

396
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:30,605
put your mind at ease.

397
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:34,215
Please my King...

398
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:56,535
<i>'Jangdong Kim-Moon' Family Residence</i>

399
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,995
Move on, my Lord.

400
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,119
If you put that man
in a minister position,

401
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:44,189
<i>Dangsanggwan
Under management of Ranking 3 officers and above</i>

402
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:47,015
he will make a negative report to
the King to betray you.

403
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:52,625
I thought so myself...

404
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:59,695
Is this not enough?

405
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:02,395
Let me go, please.

406
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:07,705
My mother...
where is my mother?

407
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:19,149
Princess as your gift is incredible,

408
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:22,455
our Jangdong Kim family
will thrive from it

409
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:28,155
until your very last breath!

410
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:33,225
You bastard!

411
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:36,935
You made the promise!

412
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:39,735
Let go of me!

413
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:45,005
Mother... mother!

414
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:50,585
Mother!

415

Chun-Jung!

421
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:44,625
Aren't you the minister of finance?

422
00:46:49,470 --> 00:46:51,169
As a rabid dog ran towards us,

423
00:46:51,170 --> 00:46:53,765
I assumed they were bandits
and ordered an attack.

424
00:46:54,910 --> 00:46:56,035
However…

425
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:59,809
You almost got me.

426
00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:03,079
We were tracking wild boar
surfacing near our town,

427
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:05,145
and I am afraid
we were too careless.

428
00:47:07,050 --> 00:47:11,659
Anyway, what brings you here
to Gang-Hwa?

429
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:15,995
Nothing worth mentioning.
Just strolling with the ocean breeze.

430
00:47:19,370 --> 00:47:22,365
Pardon me, Sir.
I am Choi Chun-Jung.

<i>Up until the top!</i>

00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:55,865
Why do your peasants walk the road

435
00:47:56,570 --> 00:47:59,169
<i>They deserve the spanking
for disrespect!</i>

436

I ordered them not to my Lord.

437

What?

438
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:06,579
These people are trying
to make a living here.

439
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:08,279
It would be the big waste of time

440
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:12,545
if everyone had to stop and bow
for every highborn passing?

441
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:16,689
Choi Gyung, since you have
become a governor here 5 years ago,

442
00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:18,955
this place has changed greatly.

Oh, no way my master.

I don't understand our Lord Governor!

451
00:49:03,670 --> 00:49:06,969
He only listens to that ridiculous monk's
premonitions to keep you here,

452
00:49:06,970 --> 00:49:10,379
a great young man who won
the first place in the state exam.

453
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:14,915
That enlightened monk happened to
foresee the date of my mother's death.

454
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:18,389
He is a great Shaman and my father's

00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:32,695
and they say she is gorgeous!

460
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:37,065
When men get a glimpse of her
they all fall head over heels!

461
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:43,075
Do you still yearn for Bong-Ryun?

<i>It has already been 5 years since?</i>

<i>Haven't you searched everywhere
for her already?</i>

464
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:53,789
She probably has forgotten
all about you

465
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:56,585
and is married happily to
somebody already by now...

466
00:49:58,990 --> 00:50:02,895
If so, I will feel kind of bad...

467
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:10,069

In two days, my Lord.

479
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:41,699
Two days you say...

480
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:45,605
Not much time to carry out
this mission.

481
00:50:48,710 --> 00:50:49,905
A mission?

482
00:50:50,610 --> 00:50:56,645
The King has requested
your son and Princess's marriage.

483
00:51:04,690 --> 00:51:08,725
Talking about her marriage in front of her
must make her too self-conscious...

484
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,455
Why don't we find
some other place to speak?

485
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:29,219
Have you looked into it?

486
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:30,379
Yes, Ma'am.

Yes, I see...

489
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:43,525
It has been 5 years

490
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:45,765
Do you know where she went?

491
00:51:46,130 --> 00:51:48,765
Nobody knows ma'am...
my apologies.

492
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:58,705
What is this?

493
00:51:58,710 --> 00:52:02,275
Children working
at the Gwan-Jin ferry found this.

494
00:52:05,350 --> 00:52:06,945
<i>It is gun powder, my Lord</i>

495
00:52:08,290 --> 00:52:11,355
Gun powder? At the ferry?

496
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,925
I suspect smugglers are dealing here.

497
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:19,799
<i>This is a piece of oil paper
wrapping the pouch,</i>

498
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:23,935
but hard to tell the exact shape
because of the tear.

499
00:52:45,330 --> 00:52:48,895
Have you moved
the gun powder safely?

500
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,995
Yes, Lord.

501
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:04,845
<i>Our family's future depends on
your success of the job at Gang-Hwa.</i>

502
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:08,875
Are you up for the task?

503
00:53:09,150 --> 00:53:10,215
Yes, Father.

504
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:13,345
I will delay the fleet's departure
and as for Choi Gyung...

505
00:53:14,150 --> 00:53:19,125
We must get rid of him
in the end?

506
00:54:07,610 --> 00:54:11,375
<i>This dream again...</i>

507
00:54:13,310 --> 00:54:15,275
<i>ever since I came here…</i>

508
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:39,505
Are you not the minister of finance!

509
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:10,195
<i>You came back.</i>

510
00:56:15,670 --> 00:56:17,035
What the hell are you doing now?

511
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:23,435
You know you can lose your head
for intruding the cargo vessel?

512
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:40,315
Your martial arts is terrible

513
00:57:40,490 --> 00:57:42,585
but you are more slippery
than an eel!

514
00:57:42,790 --> 00:57:43,819
Why are doing this?

515
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:45,429
You do not know why?

516
00:57:45,430 --> 00:57:47,125
Because you look too suspicious?

517
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:57,435
Happy now?

518
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:39,335
Happy now?

519
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:30,145
<i>Could you possibly
still remember me?</i>

520
00:59:33,060 --> 00:59:34,325
You came back.

521
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:40,125
Bong-Ryun!

522
01:00:07,514 --> 01:00:10,348
<i>Wind and Cloud and Rain</i>

523
01:00:10,349 --> 01:00:41,107
