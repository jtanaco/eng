1
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:09,615
(Episode 21)

2
00:00:35,917 --> 00:00:38,605
(Born Again)

3
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,401
Shall I kill him now?

4
00:00:51,577 --> 00:00:53,406
There were three people who went in,

5
00:00:54,632 --> 00:00:56,247
but only two came out.

6
00:01:43,486 --> 00:01:44,860
Kim Su Hyuk.

7
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:48,798
I knew this day would come.

8
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:50,798
Sung Ha,

9
00:01:52,351 --> 00:01:56,612
I'll take your revenge
and bring Ma Chul back.

10
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:15,848
You won't die.

11
00:02:16,731 --> 00:02:18,177
Not yet.

12
00:02:19,444 --> 00:02:20,818
You still have things left to do.

13
00:02:24,156 --> 00:02:25,970
- It's a cardiac arrest.
- 120 joules!

14
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:27,955
Shot!

15
00:02:28,062 --> 00:02:29,217
Charging to 160 joules.

16
00:02:30,118 --> 00:02:31,172
Make it 200.

17
00:02:31,461 --> 00:02:33,032
It's ready, doctor.

18
00:02:33,163 --> 00:02:34,125
Shot!

19
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,078
(January 25, 1988)

20
00:03:04,897 --> 00:03:06,030
Come quickly.

21
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,127
I know that he is alive.

22
00:03:10,664 --> 00:03:14,220
He'll be back in his time.

23
00:03:15,921 --> 00:03:20,382
Sometimes, I meet people
who have seen Gong Ji Chul.

24
00:03:28,928 --> 00:03:30,716
The prison officer in charge
of Gong Ji Chul...

25
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:34,689
kept the secret that he possessed
a fountain pen.

26
00:03:34,777 --> 00:03:37,380
("Don't tell me that you know me.
I don't know you.")

27
00:03:37,381 --> 00:03:39,310
("You, thou, happiness.
You, thou, love.")

28
00:04:25,205 --> 00:04:29,161
("The fact that I'm alive is no more
than a rumor forever.")

29
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,917
Being an evil painter,
Gong Ji Chul...

30
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:46,219
did not regret his murder...

31
00:04:47,133 --> 00:04:49,573
and was confident
at the execution ground.

32
00:04:50,476 --> 00:04:51,818
The murder was...

33
00:04:52,611 --> 00:04:54,378
his work of art.

34
00:04:58,383 --> 00:05:00,575
(May 31, 1988)

35
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:25,583
Let's go visit your wife
at the hospital after this.

36
00:05:26,226 --> 00:05:28,587
She will deliver a healthy baby.

37
00:05:28,635 --> 00:05:30,801
Yes, she will.

38
00:06:25,903 --> 00:06:28,320
Is this...

39
00:06:29,171 --> 00:06:32,194
Lawyer Jang Hye Mi's house?

40
00:07:01,366 --> 00:07:03,331
If you tell anyone that I'm alive...

41
00:07:04,445 --> 00:07:05,622
you...

42
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,677
as well your family will die.

43
00:07:28,578 --> 00:07:32,491
Do you believe Gong Ji Chul is
still alive somewhere?

44
00:07:32,624 --> 00:07:33,852
Well.

45
00:07:34,648 --> 00:07:38,213
I did write this book
but Gong Ji Chul is...

46
00:07:38,702 --> 00:07:41,432
an evil being created by society.

47
00:07:42,867 --> 00:07:45,172
All of it could be real...

48
00:07:45,758 --> 00:07:48,613
or a fictitious novel
I have written.

49
00:07:49,383 --> 00:07:52,367
People prefer to settle for a lie...

50
00:07:52,562 --> 00:07:55,016
rather than see
the uncomfortable truth.

51
00:07:56,047 --> 00:07:57,786
Should I read the next passage?

52
00:08:07,859 --> 00:08:11,023
A woman helped Gong Ji Chul
to escape.

53
00:08:11,899 --> 00:08:16,090
The woman supported Gong Ji Chul
who killed...

54
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:18,437
her stepfather who has raped her.

55
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:21,651
She was the woman of Gong Ji Chul.

56
00:08:21,844 --> 00:08:23,611
Inside her,

57
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:27,502
Gong Ji Chul's baby was growing.

58
00:08:49,578 --> 00:08:52,363
There's cash inside the book.
You will need it.

59
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,883
But must you go?

60
00:08:57,351 --> 00:08:59,493
It'll be better for you to hide
for the time being.

61
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,809
You asked me to find out
where Jung Ha Eun is.

62
00:09:05,992 --> 00:09:07,590
Open the last page in the book.

63
00:09:11,937 --> 00:09:13,798
You can go to the place
that's written in the book.

64
00:09:13,892 --> 00:09:15,977
It's the address of the hospital
in Samcheok.

65
00:09:17,405 --> 00:09:19,087
(Won Nam Hospital, Jichul-dong
2090-11, Samcheok, Gangwon-do)

66
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:28,978
Then he went to fulfill
his last wish...

67
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:31,303
with the time he had left.

68
00:09:31,382 --> 00:09:34,006
That last wish was revenge.

69
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:36,465
The detective who tormented him...

70
00:09:36,466 --> 00:09:38,718
and his lover who testified
against him.

71
00:09:39,452 --> 00:09:40,806
Gong Ji Chul thought...

72
00:09:40,893 --> 00:09:44,082
the two should pay for their sins.

73
00:09:46,555 --> 00:09:48,719
It's me, Jang Hye Mi.

74
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,635
You're being too cold
considering I'm your past lover.

75
00:09:55,336 --> 00:09:56,396
By the way,

76
00:09:57,234 --> 00:09:59,535
I saw Gong Ji Chul today...

77
00:09:59,692 --> 00:10:01,233
whom you have executed.

78
00:10:01,664 --> 00:10:03,019
You saw...

79
00:10:03,866 --> 00:10:04,853
Gong Ji Chul?

80
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,601
April 7, 1979, was...

81
00:10:07,602 --> 00:10:10,116
the day Gong Ji Chul committed
his first murder. Do you remember?

82
00:10:11,137 --> 00:10:13,764
He hurt his back after falling...

83
00:10:13,765 --> 00:10:15,475
while working
at a construction site.

84
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:18,775
He hovered between life and death
for two days in Suncheon hospital.

85
00:10:20,058 --> 00:10:21,727
As I remember it,

86
00:10:22,135 --> 00:10:24,329
the yellow umbrella case
that day was...

87
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:27,376
near Changsin-dong, Seoul.

88
00:10:28,862 --> 00:10:30,087
It's funny.

89
00:10:30,321 --> 00:10:32,907
I wonder how Gong Ji Chul who was
in bed in Suncheon Hospital...

90
00:10:32,908 --> 00:10:36,441
went all the way to Seoul
to kill someone?

91
00:10:36,632 --> 00:10:39,444
Didn't you even check
his hospital records?

92
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:40,484
What is it...

93
00:10:41,154 --> 00:10:42,230
you want to say?

94
00:10:42,231 --> 00:10:45,296
You should kill him properly
this time without mistake.

95
00:10:46,572 --> 00:10:48,908
Once it's found Gong Ji Chul is not
the real culprit...

96
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:51,656
I will be in trouble too.

97
00:10:52,108 --> 00:10:53,194
Just like you.

98
00:10:53,881 --> 00:10:56,426
There is a large hospital
at the pier in Samcheok.

99
00:10:57,368 --> 00:11:00,265
The name of the hospital is
Won Nam Hospital.

100
00:11:00,512 --> 00:11:01,800
You can find him there.

101
00:11:16,823 --> 00:11:19,317
I will keep...

102
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,887
my mouth shut forever.

103
00:11:22,413 --> 00:11:23,455
Prosecutor.

104
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:26,839
You may go.

105
00:11:28,245 --> 00:11:33,323
(Prosecutor Chun Seok Tae)

106
00:11:38,854 --> 00:11:40,338
- Hello?
- Yes.

107
00:11:40,765 --> 00:11:43,308
That thing. Your drug smuggling.

108
00:11:44,244 --> 00:11:46,843
I'll take care of that,
but you owe me a favor.

109
00:11:47,056 --> 00:11:49,768
- I need you to take care of him.
- How should I do it?

110
00:11:49,782 --> 00:11:51,458
He's already executed.

111
00:11:51,493 --> 00:11:52,651
He's already dead!

112
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:56,488
You're asking me how to take care
of a dead man?

113
00:12:14,985 --> 00:12:17,064
(Won Nam Hospital, Jichul-dong
2090-11, Samcheok, Gangwon-do)

114
00:12:18,836 --> 00:12:20,347
(Won Nam Hosptial)

115
00:12:45,512 --> 00:12:48,106
Hey, remove that hood from him.

116
00:12:50,225 --> 00:12:53,979
Organs aside, we'll have to see his
eyes to give them a grade.

117
00:13:03,202 --> 00:13:05,377
Hey, what's the use of surviving?

118
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:08,341
Don't kill him. we need to take out
the heart while he's still alive.

119
00:13:29,693 --> 00:13:31,343
(Cabin)

120
00:13:38,591 --> 00:13:39,895
I stabbed a critical point.

121
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:52,237
No one saw how Gong Ji Chul died.

122
00:13:53,905 --> 00:13:56,808
If he is still alive,

123
00:13:57,876 --> 00:13:59,377
he will return...

124
00:13:59,762 --> 00:14:02,180
to us at his time.

125
00:14:04,973 --> 00:14:06,718
- It's a cardiac arrest.
- 120 joules!

126
00:14:07,795 --> 00:14:09,821
- Shot!
- Charging to 164.

127
00:14:10,945 --> 00:14:11,952
Make it 200.

128
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:13,725
It's ready, doctor.

129
00:14:13,851 --> 00:14:14,800
Shot!

130
00:14:16,006 --> 00:14:17,213
We have a pulse.

131
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,604
Get him ready for surgery.

132
00:14:28,003 --> 00:14:29,849
I have to get into surgery
right away.

133
00:14:29,904 --> 00:14:31,076
Are you his guardian?

134
00:14:32,252 --> 00:14:33,836
What's his name?

135
00:14:33,837 --> 00:14:34,733
His name...

136
00:14:34,734 --> 00:14:36,677
I called his parents
so they'll be here any minute.

137
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:38,507
Wait.

138
00:14:39,175 --> 00:14:40,285
I'll sign it.

139
00:14:44,823 --> 00:14:46,458
I'm his mother.

140
00:14:47,425 --> 00:14:51,029
I thought his heart stopped
just a while ago.

141
00:14:51,594 --> 00:14:53,594
His brain won't deteriorate...

142
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,278
as aftermath, will it?

143
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,623
There's a bullet in his head.

144
00:14:57,675 --> 00:15:01,193
We need to get it out through
operation before it hits the brain.

145
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,850
Are you saying his brain is
already messed up?

146
00:15:05,927 --> 00:15:08,053
We can only see
how much damage was done...

147
00:15:08,054 --> 00:15:09,821
after we open his skull.

148
00:15:10,524 --> 00:15:12,872
If you can't guarantee that
the brain is not damaged...

149
00:15:12,994 --> 00:15:14,810
I won't agree to the operation.

150
00:15:15,299 --> 00:15:17,247
If you can't save him
without an operation...

151
00:15:18,185 --> 00:15:19,661
I will move him to another hospital.

152
00:15:20,356 --> 00:15:21,860
What are you doing?

153
00:15:22,638 --> 00:15:24,740
- Who are you?
- Me?

154
00:15:25,461 --> 00:15:27,997
I'm the one who saved your son.

155
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:30,767
I saved him once,
I'll save him again.

156
00:15:31,692 --> 00:15:33,171
Why aren't you getting ready?

157
00:15:33,507 --> 00:15:35,607
If he dies, all of you will too.

158
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:40,113
Let's move him.

159
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:55,269
(The Center Operating Room)

160
00:16:25,897 --> 00:16:28,376
(Nice to meet you.)

161
00:16:34,811 --> 00:16:38,903
The bullet was closer to the brain
than was shown on the CT scan...

162
00:16:38,904 --> 00:16:40,919
so we couldn't take the bullet out.

163
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,872
We will just have to wait...

164
00:16:42,873 --> 00:16:46,701
until the bullet moves away
from the brain.

165
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:49,390
- What about brain damage?
- Well,

166
00:16:49,496 --> 00:16:51,805
the bullet is in the temporal lobe,

167
00:16:51,883 --> 00:16:54,819
what we call the hippocampus.

168
00:16:55,173 --> 00:16:57,555
We'll see after he wakes up...

169
00:16:57,656 --> 00:17:00,199
but he may suffer
from light amnesia...

170
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,394
where he doesn't recognize
his friends and family.

171
00:17:03,209 --> 00:17:07,899
Worst case scenario, he may show
signs of dementia or delirium.

172
00:17:09,288 --> 00:17:10,201
What did you say?

173
00:17:11,123 --> 00:17:12,437
Delirium?

174
00:17:13,885 --> 00:17:15,473
Is his hippocampus damaged?

175
00:17:23,932 --> 00:17:25,932
Wait.

176
00:17:26,818 --> 00:17:27,785
If...

177
00:17:30,585 --> 00:17:32,421
Jong Bum wakes up...

178
00:17:33,486 --> 00:17:35,254
give him this.

179
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:36,457
Please.

180
00:17:42,805 --> 00:17:45,291
Your son is in no shape
to go to America.

181
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,833
They don't know if he'll live.

182
00:17:48,602 --> 00:17:50,275
Did you not see him hit
with a bullet?

183
00:17:56,959 --> 00:17:59,087
Even a thug won't do this
to his family.

184
00:18:12,127 --> 00:18:13,805
(Jong Woo)

185
00:18:13,949 --> 00:18:15,156
Listen, son.

186
00:18:17,073 --> 00:18:18,865
You should start drinking
the harp seal juice...

187
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:20,480
your brother was having.

188
00:18:21,105 --> 00:18:23,741
You can only have nuts
as your snack.

189
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:27,003
You know I had you on the plane
on purpose, right?

190
00:18:27,612 --> 00:18:29,459
You're an American citizen.

191
00:18:30,181 --> 00:18:33,885
You don't need to compete
with beggars in this tiny land.

192
00:18:34,265 --> 00:18:35,311
You know...

193
00:18:35,312 --> 00:18:38,856
you'll be lonely if you don't do
extracurricular activities, right?

194
00:18:39,323 --> 00:18:40,981
Let's start learning the cello.

195
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,949
Start to learn football.

196
00:18:43,373 --> 00:18:45,424
So you can make friends in America.

197
00:18:52,482 --> 00:18:53,637
(One year later)

198
00:19:00,564 --> 00:19:01,546
Professor.

199
00:19:02,046 --> 00:19:04,053
I think Jong Bum came back
from America.

200
00:19:04,264 --> 00:19:04,910
What?

201
00:19:04,911 --> 00:19:07,327
I saw him in Insa-dong yesterday.

202
00:19:07,569 --> 00:19:08,607
That can't be.

203
00:19:08,654 --> 00:19:11,692
I talked with his parents, he's
an exchange student in America.

204
00:19:11,744 --> 00:19:13,333
I'm sure it was him.

205
00:19:13,484 --> 00:19:15,206
But he seemed...

206
00:19:15,589 --> 00:19:17,795
a bit changed.

207
00:19:18,571 --> 00:19:20,158
He gave me the chills.

208
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,133
He looked kind of sick.

209
00:19:35,761 --> 00:19:36,675
Jong Bum...

210
00:20:01,675 --> 00:20:03,274
I love you.

211
00:20:10,819 --> 00:20:11,719
Should we...

212
00:20:12,174 --> 00:20:15,060
- be a family?
- Since I'm a criminal...

213
00:20:16,025 --> 00:20:17,494
I guess we are family.

214
00:20:33,037 --> 00:20:35,920
You kick the floor with one foot
when you're flustered.

215
00:20:51,012 --> 00:20:53,137
You close your mouth and talk
with your eyes.

216
00:20:53,747 --> 00:20:54,970
That's when you're worried.

217
00:21:06,111 --> 00:21:08,446
(Did you really go to America?
I can't believe your family.)

218
00:21:08,447 --> 00:21:10,936
(It's all my fault. Why aren't you
returning my calls?)

219
00:21:11,865 --> 00:21:15,126
Jong Bum, are you in Korea?

220
00:21:16,965 --> 00:21:19,325
Are you busy or are you sick?

221
00:21:27,379 --> 00:21:28,992
Who is this?

222
00:21:29,016 --> 00:21:31,145
Dad, why do you sound like that?

223
00:21:32,138 --> 00:21:34,490
Didn't the pretty therapist
visit you today?

224
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:38,689
I'll be over there. We should
grab a drink.

225
00:21:58,307 --> 00:22:00,210
(There is no signal.)

226
00:22:03,391 --> 00:22:06,920
(Jung Sa Bin)

227
00:22:16,872 --> 00:22:19,317
- Move it to this side...
- Look who it is.

228
00:22:19,318 --> 00:22:23,748
It's Detective Rambo who got
suspended after the gun accident.

229
00:22:23,773 --> 00:22:24,869
Start briefing.

230
00:22:24,894 --> 00:22:27,080
A hiker found this early this dawn.

231
00:22:27,105 --> 00:22:29,480
Her name is Kim Yi Su, aged 33.

232
00:22:29,505 --> 00:22:32,013
This was found in a pile of dirt
under the tree...

233
00:22:32,038 --> 00:22:33,308
where the body was found.

234
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:38,407
Forensics say it looks like
it came out from the body.

235
00:22:38,512 --> 00:22:40,005
It's a heart transplant patient.

236
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:41,481
We'll have to undergo
a precise autopsy,

237
00:22:41,506 --> 00:22:44,614
but from the dent in the skull
and the thyroid cartilage fracture,

238
00:22:44,639 --> 00:22:47,578
it seems like this person was hit
with a dull object...

239
00:22:47,788 --> 00:22:51,132
and strangled with something similar
to nylon wire.

240
00:22:52,423 --> 00:22:54,164
Start the precision autopsy.

241
00:22:54,336 --> 00:22:55,236
Yes, sir.

242
00:22:56,822 --> 00:22:58,011
Let's see the umbrella.

243
00:23:01,192 --> 00:23:04,254
The details are too vivid
to be called a copycat crime.

244
00:23:04,769 --> 00:23:06,308
He's back, isn't he?

245
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:09,529
(Jung Sa Bin)

246
00:23:09,724 --> 00:23:12,759
The victim's name is Kim Yi Su,
but why's it written as Jung Sa Bin?

247
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:14,891
Wait a minute.

248
00:23:15,032 --> 00:23:16,964
The reason he didn't write
the date is...

249
00:23:17,023 --> 00:23:19,147
maybe he's going to kill
Jung Sa Bin soon.

250
00:23:29,283 --> 00:23:30,128
Dad,

251
00:23:30,238 --> 00:23:33,027
why do you look so down today?

(Prosecutor Kim Su Hyuk)

253
00:23:55,365 --> 00:23:56,575
Who are you?

254
00:23:56,576 --> 00:23:57,544
Hello,

255
00:23:57,645 --> 00:24:00,903
I'm Han Hee Ji,
the new art therapist...

256
00:24:01,037 --> 00:24:02,479
for Mr. Jung Sung Eun
since last month.

257
00:24:02,832 --> 00:24:03,948
Are you his daughter?

258
00:24:04,454 --> 00:24:05,354
Yes.

(The Magic of Color Psychology)

260
00:24:19,161 --> 00:24:21,060
Don't you think your father's...

261
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:23,692
color yellow is a bit compulsive?

262
00:24:24,235 --> 00:24:25,433
Other patients give off...

263
00:24:25,434 --> 00:24:28,765
the energetic and positive
energy from yellow.

264
00:24:28,939 --> 00:24:32,777
But your father is feeling
extreme anxiety and fear...

265
00:24:32,777 --> 00:24:33,978
of the color yellow.

266
00:24:34,512 --> 00:24:36,280
He has no other choice
but to feel that way.

267
00:24:37,416 --> 00:24:39,056
He'll get better soon.

268
00:24:39,079 --> 00:24:40,413
Don't worry too much.

269
00:24:42,075 --> 00:24:43,710
Let's end our class here.

270
00:24:44,318 --> 00:24:46,274
Let's have a meal sometime.

271
00:24:46,449 --> 00:24:50,511
I'm so thankful that you're giving
my dad a private lesson.

272
00:24:50,547 --> 00:24:51,447
Sure.

(Prosecutor Kim Su Hyuk)

274
00:24:59,145 --> 00:25:00,513
Aren't you going to check it?

275
00:25:00,591 --> 00:25:02,059
It could be an urgent message.

276
00:25:06,167 --> 00:25:08,469
I'm at the NFS
because of some remains we found.

277
00:25:09,294 --> 00:25:10,295
Please call me.

278
00:25:11,763 --> 00:25:12,898
Excuse me.

279
00:25:23,642 --> 00:25:25,343
Good job, mister.

280
00:25:26,323 --> 00:25:29,772
You'll have to do as I say
to save your daughter's life.

281
00:25:31,042 --> 00:25:32,120
Did you get that?

282
00:25:43,307 --> 00:25:45,166
Until when will you not answer
my calls?

283
00:25:46,582 --> 00:25:48,719
Did you say you found some remains?

284
00:25:48,719 --> 00:25:50,855
Let's meet and talk.

285
00:25:51,534 --> 00:25:52,735
Okay.

286
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:54,790
I'll be back around seven.

287

(Chun Jong Bum)

00:26:23,507 --> 00:26:25,310
(Chun Jong Bum)

289
00:26:32,675 --> 00:26:33,876
Chun Jong Bum?

290
00:26:39,114 --> 00:26:40,014
Who...

291
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:42,076
are you?

292
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:07,676
You said
Chun Jong Bum was dead.

293
00:27:07,701 --> 00:27:11,068
He's dead for sure.
He was shot in the head.

294
00:27:11,068 --> 00:27:14,405
He shed a lot of blood.

295
00:27:14,405 --> 00:27:15,958
Who is this then?

296
00:27:15,977 --> 00:27:18,146
Only Chun Jong Bum knows
this number.

297
00:27:18,147 --> 00:27:21,316
If he's really dead,
bring me his corpse right now.

298
00:27:33,465 --> 00:27:34,365
Weren't you...

299
00:27:34,931 --> 00:27:36,697
dead yet?

300
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:44,860
She's about 167 cm tall,
weighing about 49 kg.

301
00:27:47,168 --> 00:27:49,179
There's a fracture
on the right part.

302
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:51,145
I can see a microfracture
in a radial shape.

303
00:27:51,716 --> 00:27:54,256
I think this person was hit
by something like a baseball bat.

304
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,928
The fracture was not
the immediate cause of death.

305
00:27:58,607 --> 00:28:01,193
The cause of death is a fracture
on the thyroid cartilage.

306
00:28:01,463 --> 00:28:03,320
Both tongue bones were fractured.

307
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,322
This was strangulation.

308
00:28:05,322 --> 00:28:06,490
Sa Bin,

309
00:28:07,891 --> 00:28:09,641
- what happened a year ago...
- I do not wish...

310
00:28:09,872 --> 00:28:11,435
to talk about it.

311
00:28:13,833 --> 00:28:15,462
It's a difficult memory
for me,

312
00:28:15,463 --> 00:28:17,138
just like it is for you.

313
00:28:17,981 --> 00:28:20,489
But your name was on the umbrella...

314
00:28:21,696 --> 00:28:23,410
that was found next to the body.

315
00:28:23,466 --> 00:28:24,704
My name?

316
00:28:24,729 --> 00:28:25,923
Sa Bin,

317
00:28:26,566 --> 00:28:28,144
you need to be protected.

318
00:28:29,794 --> 00:28:32,318
I'll call the police
if I need protection.

319
00:28:57,206 --> 00:28:58,934
If the suspect of the yellow
umbrella murder case is...

320
00:28:59,301 --> 00:29:00,964
Chun Jong Bum,

321
00:29:01,021 --> 00:29:02,721
why is this happening again?

322
00:29:09,747 --> 00:29:11,700
Are you going to say
it's another copycat crime?

323
00:29:19,771 --> 00:29:20,721
I don't hate you...

324
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:24,552
because you shot Chun Jong Bum
in the head.

325
00:29:25,662 --> 00:29:27,096
It's because you insisted
it was Chun Jong Bum...

326
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,139
even when you knew
it wasn't him.

327
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:32,366
It's because you don't regret
the fact you shot a person.

328
00:29:33,087 --> 00:29:34,611
I've been tracking
Chun Jong Bum's whereabouts...

329
00:29:35,377 --> 00:29:37,392
while I was suspended for a year.

330
00:29:38,506 --> 00:29:40,587
It was rumored
that he went to the States,

331
00:29:40,611 --> 00:29:42,146
but after checking
his departure records,

332
00:29:42,487 --> 00:29:43,854
there wasn't any record...

333
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:45,581
on him leaving the country.

334
00:29:47,913 --> 00:29:49,444
I have nothing to say.

335
00:29:50,327 --> 00:29:51,499
I told you.

336
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,691
I'm not going to lose
anyone close to me.

337
00:29:56,148 --> 00:29:57,507
I don't care if you hate...

338
00:29:57,944 --> 00:30:00,647
or avoid me.

339
00:30:01,277 --> 00:30:02,527
I only need you...

340
00:30:03,053 --> 00:30:04,740
to be alive,

341
00:30:05,541 --> 00:30:06,653
just like you are now.

342
00:30:46,984 --> 00:30:48,858
Can you turn up the lights?

343
00:30:48,939 --> 00:30:50,241
Yes, sir.

344
00:30:57,930 --> 00:31:00,063
I'm sorry, we have a lot of lights.

345
00:31:00,063 --> 00:31:02,627
Wait a minute. Turn it off again.

346
00:31:02,628 --> 00:31:04,723
- Pardon?
- Turn it off again.

347
00:31:05,165 --> 00:31:06,343
Yes, sir.

348
00:31:44,442 --> 00:31:46,022
(Episode 22)

349
00:31:47,435 --> 00:31:50,160
I will issue a warrant, so search
and confiscate Yuhon gallery.

350
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:53,395
Gang Du Chul has an accomplice.
Trail him and look for clues.

351
00:32:17,107 --> 00:32:19,710
Gang Du Chul will need cash
before running away.

352
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:22,685
Wait at the ATM in front of Yuhon
and start following him.

353
00:32:22,685 --> 00:32:25,718
That pervert is going inside
the bank before me now.

354
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:35,340
Yes, Kim Su Hyuk found out it's me.

355
00:32:56,685 --> 00:32:57,964
Chun Jong Bum.

356
00:33:00,192 --> 00:33:03,060
Why do you judge people and
give them a tag?

357
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:06,349
I don't think Jong Bum did that
to Detective Ju.

358
00:33:06,349 --> 00:33:07,959
Are you going to say
it's a copycat crime again?

359
00:33:07,966 --> 00:33:10,138
Lim Hwa Young murder case?

360
00:33:10,138 --> 00:33:13,861
She confessed to me
while she was drunk...

361
00:33:14,098 --> 00:33:15,809
that she killed her child.

362
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:18,263
He earnestly wants to change.

363
00:33:18,302 --> 00:33:21,427
I'll try to be a normal person.

364
00:33:25,386 --> 00:33:27,131
Is he really not the one?

365
00:34:17,818 --> 00:34:20,266
(Jung Sa Bin)

366
00:34:22,537 --> 00:34:26,385
The number you have dialed is
currently unavailable...

367
00:34:29,421 --> 00:34:31,721
(The location cannot be found.)

368
00:34:38,794 --> 00:34:40,513
Professor, it's Kim Su Hyuk.

369
00:34:40,856 --> 00:34:42,872
is Sa Bin at the NFS right now?

370
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:19,270
Look at my hard work drawing
200 cuts in a frame.

371
00:35:19,466 --> 00:35:20,623
Come on. Hurry up.

372
00:35:20,623 --> 00:35:24,860
I will breathe into the dead
and he will resurrect.

373
00:35:24,998 --> 00:35:29,177
Mr. John Doe. Show yourself
the way you were 30 years ago.

374
00:35:29,177 --> 00:35:32,574
Make him resurrect holding
a walkie-talkie.

375
00:35:43,255 --> 00:35:47,507
This is Prosecutor Kim Su Hyuk.

376
00:35:48,607 --> 00:35:50,704
They must look alike.

377
00:36:25,074 --> 00:36:26,897
(Autopsy Room)

378
00:37:56,271 --> 00:37:58,584
Put the book inside if you want
to give a memorial service...

379
00:37:58,584 --> 00:37:59,796
to that detective.

380
00:38:00,388 --> 00:38:03,981
In his next life, he can be born
like Gong Ji Chul.

381
00:38:04,084 --> 00:38:07,447
Gong Ji Chul cherished that book
as if it was his life.

382
00:38:29,498 --> 00:38:31,871
He was murdered
on the happiest day of his life.

383
00:38:31,974 --> 00:38:34,465
That's why he did not decay.

384
00:38:35,474 --> 00:38:38,654
He bought a ring he'll place
in his lover's fingers...

385
00:38:38,661 --> 00:38:40,458
and was on his way to see her...

386
00:38:40,552 --> 00:38:42,972
but died even before he met her.

387
00:38:46,412 --> 00:38:49,443
It's 830403?

388
00:38:49,443 --> 00:38:51,154
Is it the date of the wedding?

389
00:38:51,568 --> 00:38:53,521
April 3, 1983.

390
00:38:53,521 --> 00:38:55,845
It could be the first day he met
his bride.

391
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:58,709
Or a special anniversary.

392
00:38:58,888 --> 00:39:02,279
(Old Future)

393
00:39:06,224 --> 00:39:09,606
It's a keepsake found at the site
of the murder of Jung's parents.

394
00:39:18,724 --> 00:39:21,873
So don't make a confession
on the first night.

395
00:39:22,046 --> 00:39:24,568
It's not like he'll forgive you
if you did.

396
00:39:27,474 --> 00:39:31,724
If Tess didn't confess her past
to Angel on the first night,

397
00:39:31,958 --> 00:39:34,794
Angel would not have left Tess.

398
00:39:34,795 --> 00:39:37,677
Then Tess would not have been
a murderer.

399
00:39:38,622 --> 00:39:41,660
They didn't have to end up unhappy.

400
00:39:48,114 --> 00:39:50,550
Doesn't it take courage
to confess your sin?

401
00:39:52,616 --> 00:39:54,918
("Wuthering Heights"
by Emily Brontë)

402
00:39:55,724 --> 00:39:59,097
Giving pressure to forgive
to someone who is hurt...

403
00:39:59,098 --> 00:40:00,819
is making things harder
for him or her.

404
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:03,304
I would not confess if it were me.

405
00:40:03,304 --> 00:40:05,548
So you're going to live on
carrying your sin?

406
00:40:05,989 --> 00:40:09,021
No, the confession can be kept.

407
00:40:09,537 --> 00:40:13,037
He can protect her by her side...

408
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:14,997
and risk his life once for her.

409
00:40:24,506 --> 00:40:27,692
(Old Future)

410
00:40:29,919 --> 00:40:30,991
It's snow.

411
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,871
April 3, 1983...

412
00:40:40,068 --> 00:40:42,149
is the day it snowed in Spring.

413
00:40:42,826 --> 00:40:46,166
I wanted to see the snow with you
for the rest of my life.

414
00:40:53,919 --> 00:40:56,824
I, Cha Hyung Bin, will risk
my life...

415
00:40:56,824 --> 00:41:00,233
and protect my bride,
Jung Ha Eun, until the end.

416
00:41:07,466 --> 00:41:11,023
I've been meaning to ask you
why you look at me in that way.

417
00:41:11,031 --> 00:41:13,006
How am I looking at you?

418
00:41:13,154 --> 00:41:15,006
It's the way you'd see a lover
you broke up with.

419
00:41:15,122 --> 00:41:19,428
To be honest, I trembled
from the first time I saw you.

420
00:41:47,549 --> 00:41:48,651
Are you okay?

421
00:41:49,369 --> 00:41:51,011
I was worried about you.

422
00:41:51,288 --> 00:41:53,889
What happened? Where are you hurt?

423
00:42:02,643 --> 00:42:04,378
- Ha Eun.
- Ha Eun?

424
00:42:05,938 --> 00:42:08,570
Ha Eun, why am I lying here?

425
00:42:08,753 --> 00:42:10,099
You're the one who's sick.

426
00:42:11,818 --> 00:42:14,710
Prosecutor Kim, you are really sick
right now.

427
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:16,852
You can't even recognize me.

428
00:42:16,946 --> 00:42:19,116
What are you talking about?
Of course I recognize you.

429
00:42:19,117 --> 00:42:22,751
Which part of the holographic image
was so shocking?

430
00:42:23,564 --> 00:42:26,433
You can't even remember my name,
Jung Sa Bin.

431
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:27,768
Jung Sa Bin?

432
00:42:30,927 --> 00:42:33,147
Who's Ha Eun?

433
00:42:34,165 --> 00:42:35,964
Who is she?

434
00:42:36,322 --> 00:42:37,650
Are you really...

435
00:42:41,429 --> 00:42:43,309
Wait here. I'll bring the doctor.

436
00:43:10,502 --> 00:43:12,130
(Gu Hyul Ki)

437
00:43:15,338 --> 00:43:16,366
Sir.

438
00:43:17,716 --> 00:43:18,549
Hello?

439
00:43:18,588 --> 00:43:20,909
Did you hear
about Detective Ju waking up?

440
00:43:21,374 --> 00:43:23,712
They say it's a miracle.

441
00:43:24,524 --> 00:43:26,014
Detective Ju In Do?

442
00:43:26,435 --> 00:43:28,301
- Where is he?
- What?

443
00:43:28,492 --> 00:43:29,820
Do you not remember?

444
00:43:29,994 --> 00:43:32,621
He's in room 407 at Insung Hospital.

445
00:44:17,890 --> 00:44:19,239
(Patient: Ju In Do.)

446
00:44:30,612 --> 00:44:33,276
In Do, what happened?

447
00:44:35,498 --> 00:44:36,990
Prosecutor Kim?

448
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:39,188
It's me, Hyung Bin.
Cha Hyung Bin.

449
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,159
Is this the underworld?

450
00:44:44,858 --> 00:44:46,858
Or is he a ghost?

451
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:48,931
Is that what this is?

452
00:44:50,132 --> 00:44:54,447
Sir, I'm in no mood to joke around.

453
00:44:56,752 --> 00:45:00,509
- In Do.
- Just stop it.

454
00:45:02,311 --> 00:45:03,939
What happened to
the Hwasung serial murder case?

455
00:45:04,016 --> 00:45:05,674
That culprit was caught.

456
00:45:08,301 --> 00:45:10,853
Then what about Gong Ji Chul?
What happened to him?

457
00:45:10,878 --> 00:45:12,130
Gong Ji Chul?

458
00:45:12,807 --> 00:45:15,591
He was executed a long time ago.

459
00:45:15,723 --> 00:45:18,360
Stop joking around!

460
00:45:26,791 --> 00:45:28,145
The year 2021.

461
00:45:32,568 --> 00:45:33,690
In Do,

462
00:45:33,970 --> 00:45:36,399
you know what happened to me, right?

463
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,536
Detective Cha, you died...

464
00:45:46,547 --> 00:45:47,807
Wait.

465
00:45:48,084 --> 00:45:51,426
What's the name of the bookstore
where Ha Eun worked?

466

00:46:08,284 --> 00:46:10,479
What are you?

470
00:46:10,853 --> 00:46:12,494
Who are you?

471
00:46:52,409 --> 00:46:53,826
Where are you headed?

472
00:46:55,011 --> 00:46:56,358
Let's go to Chunggyecheon.

473
00:46:56,452 --> 00:46:57,993
Please put on your seat belt.

474
00:47:07,652 --> 00:47:08,810
Just a moment, doctor.

477
00:48:19,988 --> 00:48:21,022
Open it.

478
00:48:29,514 --> 00:48:30,556
Read it.

479

Seo Sung Ha.

481
00:48:43,607 --> 00:48:45,467
He's my only brother.

482
00:48:46,802 --> 00:48:49,571
You reminded me of him when
we first met at the school.

483
00:48:50,285 --> 00:48:53,809
He was killed by Su Hyuk as well.

484
00:48:53,995 --> 00:48:55,198
That letter was...

485
00:48:56,344 --> 00:48:59,453
sent to me a week before
he killed himself in prison.

486
00:48:59,812 --> 00:49:01,686
Try to count...

487
00:49:02,607 --> 00:49:04,486
how many times he wrote that
he wants to live again.

488
00:49:05,367 --> 00:49:07,234

Kim Su Hyuk that son of gun.

490
00:49:11,827 --> 00:49:13,650
My brother never killed anyone.

491
00:49:14,106 --> 00:49:17,041
But he got locked up
for manslaughter because of Su Hyuk.

492
00:49:20,035 --> 00:49:21,870
I don't need to tell you about
Su Hyuk anymore, right?

493
00:49:22,637 --> 00:49:24,998
You've heard enough
over the past year.

494
00:49:25,853 --> 00:49:28,977
If you get in this house today,
he won't be able to touch you.

495
00:49:29,749 --> 00:49:31,780
The man who shot you in the head...

496
00:49:32,616 --> 00:49:35,684
as long as we are alive,
he's done for.

497
00:49:35,853 --> 00:49:36,918
Also,

498
00:49:40,215 --> 00:49:42,057
that's the only reason I saved you.

499
00:49:42,615 --> 00:49:43,592
So...

500
00:49:45,219 --> 00:49:47,219
what do I need to do?

501
00:49:47,258 --> 00:49:48,330
Just stay put...

502
00:49:49,238 --> 00:49:50,158
in that house.

503
00:50:13,155 --> 00:50:14,793
It's not revenge just to stab him
with a knife.

504
00:50:14,794 --> 00:50:16,794
Stab him with your words,
it hurts more.

505
00:50:17,692 --> 00:50:19,461
You're not their family.

506
00:50:19,928 --> 00:50:21,963
You're my family who shares food.

507
00:50:22,511 --> 00:50:23,565
Remember that.

508
00:50:24,266 --> 00:50:25,834
You have everything.

509
00:50:26,265 --> 00:50:28,063
Nice house, money,

510
00:50:28,327 --> 00:50:31,044
brain, talent, and looks.

511
00:50:31,253 --> 00:50:32,707
You need to have everything.

512
00:50:33,008 --> 00:50:33,978
Get it all.

513
00:50:34,187 --> 00:50:36,344
You're the owner of this house,
got that?

514
00:50:36,748 --> 00:50:39,514
Also, I picked me up a reporter.

515
00:50:39,773 --> 00:50:43,218
Chun Seok Tae won't treat you
badly anymore.

516
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:48,416
Pick up, not pick me up.

517
00:50:52,327 --> 00:50:53,612
The doctor said...

518
00:50:54,103 --> 00:50:56,531
that your unconscious mind
remembers everything.

519
00:50:57,365 --> 00:50:59,000
If you don't remember anything...

520
00:51:01,089 --> 00:51:02,657
just follow your instincts.

521
00:51:13,381 --> 00:51:14,864
(Mobile phone)

522
00:51:18,758 --> 00:51:21,156
- Hello?
- Is this Chief Prosecutor Chun?

523
00:51:21,261 --> 00:51:22,290
Who is this?

524
00:51:22,581 --> 00:51:24,059
How did you find my number?

525
00:51:24,204 --> 00:51:26,027
I'm reporter Na Eun Sung with
the Jeil Newspaper.

526
00:51:26,175 --> 00:51:28,797
We've got some information.

527
00:51:28,926 --> 00:51:32,649
I heard that your son is on death
bed after being shot by thugs.

528
00:51:32,650 --> 00:51:33,716
Is this true?

529
00:51:34,177 --> 00:51:37,105
We already have a headline for that.

530
00:51:37,355 --> 00:51:39,107
"A heartless father
and his lowly son."

531
00:51:39,187 --> 00:51:41,688
"Chun Seok Tae who faces a promotion
as public prosecutor general."

532
00:51:42,681 --> 00:51:44,879
If you want to continue
being a reporter...

533
00:51:45,146 --> 00:51:47,916
stop making up rumors...

534
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:51,216
and start learning
how to check facts.

535
00:51:56,295 --> 00:51:57,902
Where on earth is he?

536
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:02,341
Mom.

537
00:52:02,876 --> 00:52:04,277
He's here.

538
00:52:04,332 --> 00:52:05,967
Didn't you say he was in the States?

539
00:52:35,190 --> 00:52:37,190
Your unconscious mind remembers
everything.

540
00:52:37,975 --> 00:52:39,277
If you don't remember anything...

541
00:52:40,427 --> 00:52:41,595
just follow your instincts.

542
00:53:17,832 --> 00:53:19,374
Jong Bum.

543
00:53:31,152 --> 00:53:32,313
How did you get here?

544
00:53:33,215 --> 00:53:35,116
You didn't go to the States.

545
00:53:35,658 --> 00:53:37,053
Where were you staying?

546
00:53:39,364 --> 00:53:40,499
How have you been?

547
00:53:41,262 --> 00:53:42,364
I'm healthy now.

548
00:54:02,859 --> 00:54:05,535
You lived in a wealthy family
for 23 years.

549
00:54:18,925 --> 00:54:20,595
Has your appetite changed?

550
00:54:22,517 --> 00:54:23,584
Jong Bum,

551
00:54:23,936 --> 00:54:25,707
you didn't like the smell
of cucumber.

552
00:54:27,642 --> 00:54:29,811
What happened to Jong Bum's school?

553
00:54:31,493 --> 00:54:34,666
We processed it as if he went
for an exchange program.

554
00:54:35,216 --> 00:54:38,153
You can attend lectures
starting next week.

555
00:54:39,801 --> 00:54:41,102
I almost forgot, Jong Bum.

556
00:54:41,952 --> 00:54:44,092
Do you remember
that your dad will be appointed...

557
00:54:44,521 --> 00:54:46,059
as the public prosecutor general
next week?

558
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:47,429
Since Jong Bum is here,

559
00:54:48,042 --> 00:54:49,967
we should take a family photo
this weekend.

560
00:54:50,296 --> 00:54:52,265
We're a perfect family now.

561
00:54:53,972 --> 00:54:55,737
At least pretend to play the part
if you don't want to.

562
00:54:56,261 --> 00:54:57,607
There will be a family interview.

563
00:55:01,032 --> 00:55:01,966
Yes, father.

564
00:55:04,287 --> 00:55:06,139
Make a credit card for Jong Bum.

565
00:55:06,615 --> 00:55:08,123
Don't make him work
any part-time jobs.

566
00:55:11,537 --> 00:55:13,032
We need to be alert...

567
00:55:13,033 --> 00:55:14,857
for a month from now.

568
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:16,599
Be polite...

569
00:55:17,264 --> 00:55:18,607
to your brother, Jong Woo.

570
00:55:26,492 --> 00:55:28,340
You don't need to go abroad,
Jong Woo.

571
00:55:28,403 --> 00:55:30,705
It's too hard for you to pass
the TOEFL test.

572
00:55:31,039 --> 00:55:33,963
Is it that difficult
to get a score above 80?

573
00:55:37,257 --> 00:55:39,225
I can learn English from Jong Bum.

574
00:55:40,309 --> 00:55:41,443
Is that okay,

575
00:55:41,848 --> 00:55:43,627
- Jong Bum?
- You might be...

576
00:55:44,382 --> 00:55:45,884
better than me.

577
00:55:49,238 --> 00:55:52,188
Let's get you a car, Jong Bum.

578
00:55:53,039 --> 00:55:55,136
Stop riding motorbikes.

579
00:55:55,267 --> 00:55:57,469
I never liked it.

580
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:00,001
Okay, I'll do that.

581
00:56:17,081 --> 00:56:18,249
Jong Bum,

582
00:56:18,543 --> 00:56:19,978
you and I should have a talk.

583
00:56:35,596 --> 00:56:36,900
Tell me...

584
00:56:37,634 --> 00:56:39,228
where you have been and with whom.

585
00:56:39,587 --> 00:56:40,941
I don't remember.

586
00:56:43,689 --> 00:56:45,415
Even after
Detective Kim Su Hyuk got...

587
00:56:45,956 --> 00:56:48,441
suspended
after the gunfire accident,

588
00:56:48,590 --> 00:56:50,573
he still went looking for you.

589
00:56:51,385 --> 00:56:53,174
Your mom said
you went to the States,

590
00:56:53,555 --> 00:56:54,985
but there wasn't any record
of departure.

591
00:57:00,054 --> 00:57:01,878
Where were you with whom?

592
00:57:01,932 --> 00:57:04,271
I wouldn't want to tell you
even if I remember it...

593
00:57:04,967 --> 00:57:07,081
because it's scary
when you shout like that.

594
00:57:14,502 --> 00:57:15,810
Do you remember this?

595
00:57:23,152 --> 00:57:24,241
You can leave now.

596
00:57:26,272 --> 00:57:27,541
I have somewhere I need to go.

597
00:57:27,596 --> 00:57:28,717
Why, you...

598
00:57:33,589 --> 00:57:34,489
Okay.

599
00:57:35,212 --> 00:57:37,071
I'll let the driver know.
You can go now.

600
00:57:56,996 --> 00:57:58,468
Where should I take you?

601
00:57:58,469 --> 00:57:59,622
"Old Future."

602
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:01,475
Pardon?

603
00:58:02,390 --> 00:58:03,656
Please go to the old book store...

604
00:58:04,282 --> 00:58:05,650
in Cheonggyecheon.

605
00:58:06,131 --> 00:58:07,699
I'll go to Cheonggyecheon.

606
00:58:12,001 --> 00:58:13,205
Please stop the car.

607
00:59:24,939 --> 00:59:26,574
(Born Again)

608
00:59:26,574 --> 00:59:29,544
The connecting link between 1987
and the present is the painting.

609
00:59:29,544 --> 00:59:31,846
Did you come back to life?

610
00:59:31,846 --> 00:59:34,282
It's been a while, Gong Ji Chul.
I apologize.

611
00:59:34,282 --> 00:59:36,344
It seems like everything happened
because of me.

612
00:59:36,369 --> 00:59:37,689
- Oh, my!
- How did you survive?

613
00:59:37,714 --> 00:59:40,254
It's because I didn't get
to tell her I love her.

614
00:59:40,254 --> 00:59:42,137
Are you still doubting him
as the suspect?

615
00:59:42,139 --> 00:59:43,274
Cha Hyung Bin,

616
00:59:43,335 --> 00:59:44,970
why can't you recognize me?

617
00:59:45,419 --> 00:59:47,316
We'll be together from now on.

618
00:59:47,409 --> 00:59:48,944
It's not over yet.

619
00:59:48,985 --> 00:59:51,144
I'm going to make him
confess his crimes on his own.

620
00:59:51,145 --> 00:59:53,114
Today's the day you die
for the second time.
