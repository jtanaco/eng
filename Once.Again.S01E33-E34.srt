1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,815
<b>What's wrong with you people today?</b>

2
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:13,756
<b>We have work to do!</b>

3
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:17,226
<b>Who are you? What are you to her?</b>

4
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,080
<b>- Her husband?
- No!</b>

5
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:20,919
<b>I'm...</b>

6
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:23,990
<b>I'm...</b>

7
00:00:26,019 --> 00:00:27,890
<b>a man who likes her!</b>

8
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,500
<b>I like her, okay?</b>

9
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:41,299
<b>So just give her 10 minutes!</b>

10
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,640
<b>- My goodness.
- What's wrong?</b>

11
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,079
<b>- What's the matter?
- What's wrong?</b>

12
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:56,549
<b>You've been with Jae Seok
for four years?</b>

13
00:00:58,049 --> 00:01:00,020
<b>Has it been that long already,</b>

14
00:01:00,789 --> 00:01:01,929
<b>Jae Seok?</b>

15
00:01:03,289 --> 00:01:06,729
<b>Yes, that sounds about right.</b>

16
00:01:07,729 --> 00:01:10,899
<b>I see. It's already been four years.</b>

17
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,409
<b>We hit a rough patch
when he was in Turkey though.</b>

18
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,379
<b>I thought about
ending the relationship,</b>

19
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:22,310
<b>but I just couldn't
live without him.</b>

20
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:26,120
<b>Right, I see.</b>

21
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,950
<b>I wasn't sure about
coming here today,</b>

22
00:01:30,049 --> 00:01:31,790
<b>but I mustered up the courage.</b>

23
00:01:32,689 --> 00:01:34,859
<b>Until we get his mother's approval,</b>

24
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,090
<b>I figured it was up to me
to stay strong.</b>

25
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:44,700
<b>Seriously?</b>

26
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:49,909
<b>That's right.</b>

27
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,656
<b>Gosh, my heart nearly
jumped out of my chest.</b>

28
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,489
<b>Are you sure
you were nervous in there?</b>

29
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,995
<b>You seemed like
a professional actress.</b>

30
00:02:05,019 --> 00:02:06,596
<b>Are you kidding me?</b>

31
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:09,665
<b>My heart was racing
throughout the whole time.</b>

32
00:02:09,689 --> 00:02:12,730
<b>I was worried that
she'd see right through us.</b>

33
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,145
<b>Was I okay though? Did I seem off?</b>

34
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:17,300
<b>Not at all.</b>

35
00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:19,969
<b>Where did you get
that outfit though?</b>

36
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,485
<b>Don't tell me you bought it.</b>

37
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:23,240
<b>No, it's Na Hee's.</b>

38
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:25,979
<b>Jeans and a hoodie
didn't seem appropriate.</b>

39
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:30,110
<b>- This doesn't suit me, does it?
- It's better than I expected...</b>

40
00:02:30,979 --> 00:02:33,256
<b>Anyway, thank you for doing this.</b>

41
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,165
<b>Ms. Song, you are one loyal friend.
I mean it.</b>

42
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:37,695
<b>Stop that.</b>

43
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:40,265
<b>Just know that
I won't ever do this again.</b>

44
00:02:40,289 --> 00:02:42,665
<b>Sure thing.
And to express my gratitude,</b>

45
00:02:42,689 --> 00:02:44,265
<b>I'll treat you to
a full-course meal.</b>

46
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:45,675
<b>Tell me where you want to go.</b>

47
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:48,300
<b>A hotel buffet? A wine bar? A club?</b>

48
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:51,145
<b>Forget it. I'm a student
studying for an exam, remember?</b>

49
00:02:51,169 --> 00:02:53,376
<b>It's only a one-time thing.</b>

50
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,069
<b>Besides, you need to
blow off some steam now and then.</b>

51
00:02:56,469 --> 00:02:58,539
<b>You're right, but...</b>

52
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:03,610
<b>There is a place
I've been wanting to go.</b>

53
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:05,849
<b>Where?</b>

54
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:12,590
<b>I'm a man who likes her!</b>

55
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:15,129
<b>I like her, okay?</b>

56
00:03:19,629 --> 00:03:23,330
<b>My gosh. I can't believe it.</b>

57
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:27,599
<b>Who knew he had feelings
for the kimbap lady?</b>

58
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,810
<b>Unbelievable.</b>

59
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:32,979
<b>Honey, did you know?</b>

60
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:36,156
<b>Know what?</b>

61
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,349
<b>Stop gossiping
and get the chicken batter ready.</b>

62
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:39,780
<b>Why her though?</b>

63
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,689
<b>What about her does he like?</b>

64
00:03:42,849 --> 00:03:45,265
<b>He's always been picky
with high standards...</b>

65
00:03:45,289 --> 00:03:46,759
<b>when it comes to women.</b>

66
00:03:46,819 --> 00:03:49,430
<b>Why on earth
are you so curious about it?</b>

67
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,530
<b>Now, where's my chicken batter?</b>

68
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:54,560
<b>I'm mixing it right now.
See? My hands are moving.</b>

69
00:03:56,629 --> 00:03:59,599
<b>Ok Ja, you've been
awfully quiet all this time.</b>

70
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:02,509
<b>Ok Ja?</b>

71
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:12,879
<b>Who would've seen that coming?</b>

72
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,949
<b>I'm shocked!</b>

73
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:21,060
<b>How could he fall for a woman
that reminds me of a barrel?</b>

74
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:24,790
<b>Mr. Yang sure has
weird taste in women.</b>

75
00:04:24,829 --> 00:04:28,730
<b>Actually, there's something
intriguing about her.</b>

76
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:30,399
<b>In what way?</b>

77
00:04:31,899 --> 00:04:33,699
<b>- I heard this at the salon.
- Yes?</b>

78
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,569
<b>Rumor has it...</b>

79
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:41,009
<b>that she's the girlfriend
of a notorious gangster...</b>

80
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:45,319
<b>and a former high-stakes gambler.</b>

81
00:04:56,089 --> 00:04:59,730
<b>Don't underestimate me
and my fat lower belly.</b>

82
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:04,170
<b>Don't be ridiculous.</b>

83
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:08,269
<b>Why would a gangster's girlfriend
be selling kimbap at the market?</b>

84
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,009
<b>This is what I heard
from the rice cake store.</b>

85
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:16,985
<b>Rumor has it that
she was a big player...</b>

86
00:05:17,009 --> 00:05:18,850
<b>among loan sharks.</b>

87
00:05:23,149 --> 00:05:26,165
<b>A 24 percent interest
with your car as collateral.</b>

88
00:05:26,189 --> 00:05:27,189
<b>Okay?</b>

89
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,536
<b>So she seduced Mr. Yang
with her money?</b>

90
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,537
<b>Yes.</b>

91
00:05:31,561 --> 00:05:34,675
<b>That's absurd.
Mr. Yang has quite the fortune too.</b>

92
00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:35,699
<b>You're right.</b>

93
00:05:38,069 --> 00:05:41,170
<b>Ok Ja, over here. So Mr. Yang...</b>

94
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,410
<b>What on earth?</b>

95
00:06:40,029 --> 00:06:43,706
<b>Ms. Kang,
I shocked you earlier, didn't I?</b>

96
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:46,399
<b>Yes, I guess you did in a way.</b>

97
00:06:47,769 --> 00:06:49,110
<b>Well, I'll say it again.</b>

98
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:52,879
<b>I like you, Ms. Kang.
Actually, I think I love you.</b>

99
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,355
<b>Please accept my love.</b>

100
00:06:55,379 --> 00:06:56,379
<b>My gosh.</b>

101
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,649
<b>He seems driven.</b>

102
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:02,550
<b>Right.
Well, I'm sorry to tell you this,</b>

103
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:04,519
<b>but I don't feel the same way.</b>

104
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:05,767
<b>Sorry?</b>

105
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:08,120
<b>You're not my type.</b>

106
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:10,360
<b>I like those who are handsome.</b>

107
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:14,805
<b>I'm not as bad
when it comes to my looks though.</b>

108
00:07:14,829 --> 00:07:16,505
<b>People say I seem manly.</b>

109
00:07:16,529 --> 00:07:17,899
<b>Exactly.</b>

110
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:21,199
<b>I like men
who are on the prettier side.</b>

111
00:07:21,339 --> 00:07:24,970
<b>I prefer young and fresh
over old and rich.</b>

112
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:29,026
<b>So don't bother with me anymore
and take your affections elsewhere.</b>

113
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:31,350
<b>No can do I'm afraid.</b>

114
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,355
<b>I won't.</b>

115
00:07:33,379 --> 00:07:35,925
<b>What do you mean you won't?</b>

116
00:07:35,949 --> 00:07:37,889
<b>Do you plan to
kidnap me or something?</b>

117
00:07:38,149 --> 00:07:40,995
<b>I might have to
if you won't accept my feelings.</b>

118
00:07:41,019 --> 00:07:42,959
<b>My gosh.</b>

119
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:47,136
<b>The fire in my heart
won't ever go out...</b>

120
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,670
<b>and I won't sheathe
the sword I drew.</b>

121
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:53,269
<b>Just you wait and see.
I will woo you eventually.</b>

122
00:07:58,709 --> 00:08:02,680
<b>That being said,
I wish you a good day today.</b>

123
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:06,649
<b>Have a good day, Mr. Yang!</b>

124
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,865
<b>My gosh.</b>

125
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:11,990
<b>What's gotten into him?
Gosh, now I'm scared.</b>

126
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,136
<b>Unbelievable. It wasn't one of us...</b>

127
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,536
<b>but you who he had fallen for.
My gosh.</b>

128
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,906
<b>Exactly.</b>

129
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:20,406
<b>We're the ones
who are young and pretty,</b>

130
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:22,375
<b>so why would he fall for you?</b>

131
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:24,776
<b>Has he lost his mind or something?</b>

132
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,115
<b>Shut it, you two.
I never said this out loud,</b>

133
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:30,886
<b>but I have a sex appeal
that draws men in.</b>

134
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,456
<b>Call me a femme fatale if you want.</b>

135
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,649
<b>Once hooked,
men can't seem to think straight.</b>

136
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:37,185
<b>Really?</b>

137
00:08:37,209 --> 00:08:39,079
<b>Gosh, this is news to us.</b>

138
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:42,466
<b>Anyway, this could be
quite bothersome for me.</b>

139
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:44,620
<b>He really isn't my type, you know.</b>

140
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:49,005
<b>I tried so hard not to get
caught up in romance here,</b>

141
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:50,166
<b>but it still happened.</b>

142
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:51,360
<b>What a big mess.</b>

143
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:54,375
<b>If you ask me</b>

144
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:55,446
<b>Even though she said...</b>

145
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:57,375
<b>- she's annoyed by all this,
- If this is</b>

146
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:00,216
<b>- she seems pleased if you ask me.
- Love</b>

147
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,885
<b>- It's quite obvious.
- I will say</b>

148
00:09:03,909 --> 00:09:06,309
<b>It's the seed
that leads to a breakup</b>

149
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:09,409
<b>Unbelievable.
How does this make any sense?</b>

150
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:12,326
<b>Does he carry his eyes on his feet?</b>

151
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:15,289
<b>How can he fall for
that woman of all people?</b>

152
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:21,860
<b>Ms. Jang, I was on my way
to Young Dal's store.</b>

153
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,830
<b>Is she insane?
What has gotten into her?</b>

154
00:09:31,899 --> 00:09:33,000
<b>Gosh, it hurts.</b>

155
00:09:34,269 --> 00:09:35,570
<b>Let me see though.</b>

156
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:39,009
<b>What exactly does she mean
by a pretty boy?</b>

157
00:09:39,539 --> 00:09:43,250
<b>How can I be like one
when I don't know what they're like?</b>

158
00:09:43,779 --> 00:09:46,279
<b>It's not like I can be
reborn from the ashes.</b>

159
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:50,889
<b>Hey...</b>

160
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:00,299
<b>Hyo Sin, you must be
making a delivery.</b>

161
00:10:00,429 --> 00:10:02,100
<b>Be safe on the road!</b>

162
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:05,669
<b>Like always,
the tall young man emits light.</b>

163
00:10:06,269 --> 00:10:07,916
<b>It sure is good to be young.</b>

164
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:08,940
<b>Of course.</b>

165
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:12,840
<b>Bingo.</b>

166
00:10:14,509 --> 00:10:16,809
<b>Young, fresh, and pretty.</b>

167
00:10:18,009 --> 00:10:20,279
<b>Noted.</b>

168
00:10:23,649 --> 00:10:25,149
<b>1, 2, 3.</b>

169
00:10:27,889 --> 00:10:29,789
<b>In one motion. Squeeze your core.</b>

170
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:34,200
<b>A strong core.</b>

171

<b>- 1, 2, 3.

<b>See? Your legs were wobbly. Again.</b>

173
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,210
<b>1, 2, 3.</b>

174
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,879
<b>That's it. Good job.</b>

175
00:10:51,549 --> 00:10:53,149
<b>Do it just like that 50 times. Go!</b>

176
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,120
<b>What?</b>

177
00:10:55,389 --> 00:10:56,950
<b>50 times. Go.</b>

178
00:10:58,389 --> 00:11:00,919
<b>Got it. All right.</b>

179
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,759
<b>- 1, 2, 3.
- 1, 2, 3.</b>

<b>- 1, 2, 3.
- 1, 2, 3.</b>

181
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:09,399
<b>My gosh. Really?</b>

182
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:13,700
<b>Mr. Yang confessed his feelings
in public?</b>

183
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,539
<b>To the stout lady
we saw at Dad's birthday party?</b>

184
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,669
<b>No way. I can't believe it.</b>

185
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:22,710
<b>I didn't peg him for a romantic.
The people must be gossiping.</b>

186
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:25,525
<b>Of course they are.
How could they not...</b>

187
00:11:25,549 --> 00:11:27,069
<b>when this happened
in our small market?</b>

188

<b>Why would this be a big affair?</b>

189
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:31,096
<b>What's the big deal about
one person liking another?</b>

190

<b>They're both single,

<b>I, for one, am jealous.</b>

192
00:11:37,389 --> 00:11:39,375
<b>There's love in the air

<b>but here I am

194
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:44,370
<b>Gosh, unbelievable.</b>

195
00:11:46,899 --> 00:11:48,615
<b>- It's so good.
- I'm home.</b>

- Son, you're late than usual.</b>

198
00:11:52,539 --> 00:11:53,716
<b>Come and have some dinner.</b>

199
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:56,086
<b>Here. I saved a drumstick for you.</b>

200
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:57,279
<b>I'll wash my hands first.</b>

201
00:12:00,549 --> 00:12:02,820
<b>Aren't you hungry?
Why were you held up today?</b>

202
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:11,759
<b>Gosh, it's so pretty.</b>

203
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:16,546
<b>I had no idea that
I lived in such a pretty city.</b>

204
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:19,916
<b>I can't believe that
a woman who had a fiance...</b>

205
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:22,809
<b>has never been
to Seoul Tower before.</b>

206
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:24,370
<b>Tell me about it.</b>

207
00:12:25,139 --> 00:12:27,956
<b>He spent most of his time
studying for the state exam...</b>

208
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,549
<b>and I packed meals for him.</b>

209
00:12:30,009 --> 00:12:32,755
<b>If he had a break,
we'd go to the movies,</b>

210
00:12:32,779 --> 00:12:34,320
<b>but he'd fall asleep beside me.</b>

211
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,159
<b>Enjoy it to your heart's content.</b>

212
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:43,905
<b>Just capture everything in your eyes
until you get sick of Seoul.</b>

213
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,529
<b>Okay. I will.</b>

214
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,700
<b>There are a lot of locks though.</b>

215
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:53,476
<b>I guess all the couples
in this country have been here.</b>

216
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,976
<b>How are there so many locks on here?</b>

217
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,186
<b>I think there's a catch here.</b>

218
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,745
<b>Some people overlap.</b>

219
00:12:58,769 --> 00:13:01,216
<b>They put locks here
with many different people.</b>

220
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,985
<b>Look. Think about
the buildings in Gangnam.</b>

221
00:13:04,009 --> 00:13:07,255
<b>There are many buildings, but none
of them belong to me or my friends.</b>

222
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,726
<b>That's because owners overlap.</b>

223
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,765
<b>It's like the rich get richer
and the poor get poorer.</b>

224
00:13:11,789 --> 00:13:13,590
<b>I guess you're right.</b>

225
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:16,230
<b>You are so smart.</b>

226
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:19,259
<b>Thank you for recognizing it.</b>

227
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:25,799
<b>When would I be able to come here
with a guy and put a lock here?</b>

228
00:13:26,769 --> 00:13:28,370
<b>Why? Are you envious?</b>

229
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:30,940
<b>Let's just do it.</b>

230
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:35,409
<b>Fortunately, I happen to be a guy.</b>

231
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,480
<b>- No, that's not right.
- Where?</b>

232
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:45,289
<b>- Here? This looks good.
- Okay. I'll put it here.</b>

233
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,235
<b>Thank you for today, Ms. Song.</b>

234
00:13:50,259 --> 00:13:51,759
<b>My pleasure.</b>

235
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:59,046
<b>I guess I'm the only woman
who does this with her in-laws.</b>

236
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:01,145
<b>Why? I'm doing it too.</b>

237
00:14:01,169 --> 00:14:02,440
<b>This is fun.</b>

238
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,740
<b>This is really nice.</b>

239
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:07,039
<b>Stay here.
I'll take a picture of you.</b>

240
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,826
<b>Since this is your first time here,
you should have your picture taken.</b>

241
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:13,255
<b>Then please take it focusing
on the night view, not me.</b>

242
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:14,279
<b>Okay.</b>

243
00:14:15,379 --> 00:14:18,190
<b>- I'm a great photographer.
- All right.</b>

244
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:26,176
<b>That's not good.</b>

245
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,500
<b>Move over here.</b>

246
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:30,446
<b>Okay. It's good.
The background is nice.</b>

247
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:31,700
<b>I'm taking it now.</b>

248
00:14:31,899 --> 00:14:34,070
<b>In 1, 2...</b>

249
00:14:35,269 --> 00:14:37,316
<b>What kind of pose is that?</b>

250
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:40,316
<b>- You know it's Mount Nam.
- Just stand straight.</b>

251
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:42,309
<b>Good. I'm taking it now.</b>

252
00:14:42,809 --> 00:14:45,049
<b>In 1, 2, and 3.</b>

253
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:48,350
<b>Try to look taller. In 1, 2, and 3.</b>

254
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,019
<b>Gosh, my back hurts.</b>

255
00:14:50,549 --> 00:14:52,590
<b>Okay. I took it with the background.</b>

256
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:53,990
<b>Now I'll take one from up close.</b>

257
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:55,265
<b>A close-up shot.</b>

258
00:14:55,289 --> 00:14:56,735
<b>1, 2...</b>

259
00:14:56,759 --> 00:14:58,466
<b>Gosh. Stop it.</b>

260
00:14:58,490 --> 00:14:59,600
<b>Ms. Song, sit here.</b>

261
00:15:00,129 --> 00:15:01,200
<b>Sit there.</b>

262
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:03,669
<b>No. I told you to sit.</b>

263
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:07,169
<b>Okay.</b>

264
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,610
<b>I'm taking it. In 1, 2, and 3.</b>

265
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:15,379
<b>Stay still. Lower your hands.</b>

266
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,980
<b>Stay put. I'm taking it now.
In 1, 2, and 3.</b>

267
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,649
<b>Hang on.</b>

268
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:26,220
<b>Gosh, I'm such a good photographer.</b>

269
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,519
<b>This one looks good.</b>

270
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:43,769
<b>She's pretty.</b>

271
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:18,539
<b>That's enough.
Stop taking pictures of me.</b>

272
00:16:21,409 --> 00:16:22,450
<b>Mr. Yoon.</b>

273
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:24,049
<b>Mr. Yoon?</b>

274
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:26,625
<b>Yes? What did you say?</b>

275
00:16:26,649 --> 00:16:29,296
<b>I said it's enough.
I'll take pictures of you now.</b>

276
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,566
<b>No. I'm okay.</b>

277
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,296
<b>I've been here a lot.</b>

278
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:36,759
<b>I'm not saying I came here with
a woman. Anyway, I don't need it.</b>

279
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:49,309
<b>It's Mom.</b>

280
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:51,409
<b>It's my sister.</b>

281
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:08,460
<b>- Song Da Hee.
- Na Hee.</b>

282
00:17:11,129 --> 00:17:12,976
<b>I didn't expect you to do this.</b>

283
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,535
<b>Where did you go in that dress?</b>

284
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,446
<b>The transfer exam is
not far off now.</b>

285
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:18,505
<b>How could you go out
all dressed up like that?</b>

286
00:17:18,529 --> 00:17:20,616
<b>It's not like I went out for fun.</b>

287
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,646
<b>It's you who wore the dress
I ironed a few days ago, right?</b>

288
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:24,386
<b>Did you think I wouldn't find out
if you had it dry-cleaned?</b>

289
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,779
<b>No, Na Hee. This is my first time.</b>

290
00:17:27,309 --> 00:17:29,585
<b>Seriously, this is my first time
to wear your clothes.</b>

291
00:17:29,609 --> 00:17:30,956
<b>I don't buy that.</b>

292
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:33,250
<b>You are so busted. Come here.</b>

293
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:35,626
<b>No, Na Hee. I didn't do it.</b>

294
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:37,126
<b>Please trust me.
This is my first time.</b>

295
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:39,666
<b>The longer you hold out,
the worse things get.</b>

296
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:42,366
<b>- Just tell me the truth.
- It's true. Please believe me.</b>

297
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:44,206
<b>- This is my first time.
- You, Da Hee.</b>

298
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,035
<b>How dare you wear my dress?</b>

299
00:17:46,059 --> 00:17:48,575
<b>Gosh, Na Hee.
Seriously, it wasn't me.</b>

300
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:50,430
<b>I didn't wear other dresses.</b>

301
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,716
<b>- My goodness.
- It wasn't me.</b>

302
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,069
<b>I'm sorry, Da Hee.</b>

303
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,309
<b>I will remember your sacrifice.</b>

304
00:17:57,369 --> 00:17:58,839
<b>I won't forget it.</b>

305
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:03,285
<b>- How dare you...
- Gosh, she's so spiteful.</b>

306
00:18:03,309 --> 00:18:05,349
<b>What's the big deal
about sharing clothes?</b>

307
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:15,190
<b>What is she talking about?
Is it really true?</b>

308
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:19,359
<b>Is it true that
you're seeing someone?</b>

309
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,799
<b>Yes. I have a girlfriend.</b>

310
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,039
<b>What?</b>

311
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,839
<b>How could you...</b>

312
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:31,446
<b>Who on earth is she?</b>

313
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:33,156
<b>What is her family background like?</b>

314
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,980
<b>Why did you go on a date
when you have a girlfriend?</b>

315
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:38,380
<b>Mom, ask one question at a time.</b>

316
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,779
<b>I can't tell you who she is.</b>

317
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,095
<b>I started dating her
before I went to Turkey.</b>

318
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:45,936
<b>And I didn't tell you about her...</b>

319
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,166
<b>because I knew
you would want to see her.</b>

320
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:49,690
<b>Of course I do.</b>

321
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:51,630
<b>Bring her home tomorrow.</b>

322
00:18:51,829 --> 00:18:53,676
<b>See? I knew you'd be like this.</b>

323
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,235
<b>You can never do that.</b>

324
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:57,299
<b>Why? Why can't I see her?</b>

325
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,200
<b>Well...</b>

326
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,740
<b>She's still a student.</b>

327
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,609
<b>What? A student?</b>

328
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:08,386
<b>My gosh. What a jerk.</b>

329
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:11,109
<b>You're dating a girl
who's a lot younger than you.</b>

330
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,180
<b>She's not that young.</b>

331
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,626
<b>Who on earth is she?</b>

332
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:19,420
<b>How could she captivate
your heart like that?</b>

333
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:23,089
<b>Well... Let me tell you
what she's like.</b>

334
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:26,436
<b>Excuse me. Is this yours?</b>

335
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:30,075
<b>Thank you. Thank you so much.</b>

336
00:19:30,099 --> 00:19:32,575
<b>She's so nice like a fool.</b>

337
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:34,170
<b>- She's diligent.
- Thank you.</b>

338
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:37,940
<b>Sometimes she's whimsical.</b>

339
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:40,910
<b>And...</b>

340
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:44,656
<b>- Here? This looks good.
- Okay. I'll put it here.</b>

341
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,519
<b>In 1, 2, and 3.</b>

342
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,720
<b>Again.</b>

343
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,920
<b>Stay put. I'm taking it now.
In 1, 2, and 3.</b>

344
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:56,990
<b>She's pretty.</b>

345
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,190
<b>What?</b>

346
00:20:00,529 --> 00:20:02,000
<b>I said she's pretty.</b>

347
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:06,545
<b>Mom, what did I just say?</b>

348
00:20:06,569 --> 00:20:09,515
<b>Did I say she's pretty?
I take it back. She's not pretty.</b>

349
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:12,146
<b>What's going on?
Is she pretty or not?</b>

350
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:13,985
<b>She's just average.</b>

351
00:20:14,009 --> 00:20:15,339
<b>Anyway.</b>

352
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:19,150
<b>Bring her home first. Show me.</b>

353
00:20:20,049 --> 00:20:21,450
<b>I'm telling you again.</b>

354
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,250
<b>You can't date anyone
without my permission.</b>

355
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:27,119
<b>I'll pick a girl I really like.</b>

356
00:20:27,319 --> 00:20:28,990
<b>I will never back off.</b>

357
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:32,706
<b>We can do it later.
We're not that serious yet.</b>

358
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:35,335
<b>If I married all women I've dated,
I would've gotten married 10 times.</b>

359
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:38,170
<b>I'll date her a little more.</b>

360
00:20:38,329 --> 00:20:40,799
<b>Mom, do you want to drink something?
I'm having beer.</b>

361
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,710
<b>What?</b>

362
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:49,460
<b>You said you'd just show your face,
but you came home late.</b>

363
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,819
<b>Why?</b>

364
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:55,626
<b>Did you change your mind
after seeing her?</b>

365
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:56,950
<b>Was the gallery that fancy?</b>

366
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:03,430
<b>How dare you ignore
your older brother?</b>

367
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,460
<b>Gyu Jin.</b>

368
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,906
<b>Have you ever thought
Ji Yeon is pretty?</b>

369
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:12,845
<b>Or Ms. Oh.</b>

370
00:21:12,869 --> 00:21:13,970
<b>What?</b>

371
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:16,809
<b>Nothing. Never mind.</b>

372
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:18,410
<b>Keep cleaning.</b>

373
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:26,950
<b>Gosh, he's just hopeless.
What should I do with him?</b>

374
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:41,759
<b>She is pretty.</b>

375
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,970
<b>This is strange.
Why does she look pretty?</b>

376
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:46,140
<b>She's definitely not pretty
on my terms.</b>

377
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,710
<b>She's pretty again. This is crazy.
What's wrong with me?</b>

378
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:02,896
<b>No. It's not like
I have feelings for her.</b>

379
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:06,795
<b>I haven't dated a woman for a long
time. It's just testosterone.</b>

380
00:22:06,819 --> 00:22:07,995
<b>It's just a reaction...</b>

381
00:22:08,019 --> 00:22:09,805
<b>of the pituitary gland
to visual stimulus.</b>

382
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:12,930
<b>It means nothing
more than that. Sure.</b>

<b>(Ms. Song)</b>

<b>That's right.</b>

385
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:23,809
<b>You're a healthy
average man of Korea.</b>

386
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:26,309
<b>No, that's not true.</b>

387
00:22:27,509 --> 00:22:30,410
<b>You're more than that, Jae Seok.</b>

388
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,396
<b>I made another batch of jangjorim.
I'm not sure how it tastes.</b>

389

<b>Try it.</b>

390
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:44,359
<b>Eat your fill. You need to
eat meat to gain energy.</b>

391
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:47,529
<b>Thank you so much, Ga Hee.</b>

392
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:49,359
<b>You're the best.</b>

393
00:22:58,539 --> 00:23:01,480
<b>What are you staring at?
Is there something on my face?</b>

394
00:23:01,539 --> 00:23:03,480
<b>Yes. Dried seaweed by your mouth.</b>

395
00:23:11,319 --> 00:23:14,196
<b>Mom, if you're not too busy,
will you come out for dinner?</b>

396
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,866
<b>A sushi restaurant
opened by our hospital.</b>

397

<b>You like sushi.</b>

398
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:19,559
<b>I would love to,</b>

400
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:24,745
<b>Go. Go ahead.</b>

401
00:23:24,769 --> 00:23:26,775
<b>Can we not do business without you?</b>

402
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,585
<b>There's your sister and Hyo Sin.
Just go.</b>

<b>Yes, Mom, come out for dinner.
Ga Hee and Da Hee, you too.</b>

<b>A girls' night out.</b>

405

<b>Really? I'd love it. I'm in.</b>

406
00:23:37,009 --> 00:23:38,386
<b>Me too.</b>

407
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:40,956
<b>I'll wait by your hospital

<b>- Okay.
- What about our dinner then?</b>

409

<b>Don't you worry, Ji Hun.
Uncle will cook.</b>

<b>Why don't we all get together too?</b>

411

<b>Dad. Your eldest son

<b>Expect something good, okay?</b>

413
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:57,606
<b>Take care, son. Study hard.</b>

414

<b>- See you later.

<b>Is it a jerk, just like its owner?</b>

<b>So are you.</b>

<b>I guess you sleep less at your age.</b>

<b>When I heard you'd be

<b>But you play favorites.</b>

<b>I want to be your favorite too.</b>

<b>I'm envious.</b>

<b>You're the jealous type.</b>

<b>Or is it because it's Na Hee?</b>

<b>Hi.</b>

<b>I was going to see you

<b>You can't speak because of me.</b>

<b>Okay, okay. Go ahead.</b>

439

<b>I don't think...</b>

<b>I have to move out.</b>

441

<b>I talked it out with my mom.</b>

442

<b>Did you? Did you and
your mother reconcile?</b>

443

<b>We didn't exactly reconcile,
but we worked things out.</b>

<b>Good for you.</b>

445

<b>I feel let down, though.</b>

<b>It would be fun to carpool

Move. I'll do it.</b>

00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:06,089
<b>What's this?</b>

457
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:08,490
<b>I found it on the way.</b>

458
00:27:09,589 --> 00:27:11,730
<b>You're more of a flower, though.</b>

459
00:27:14,329 --> 00:27:15,430
<b>See you.</b>

460
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:38,289
<b>What was that about? Did he...</b>

461
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:40,690
<b>pretend to be
the chicken delivery guy?</b>

462
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:42,166
<b>Because you like pretty boys?</b>

463
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:44,890
<b>It looks like it. Wow.</b>

464
00:27:45,259 --> 00:27:48,275
<b>I think he's
really into you, Cho Yeon.</b>

465
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:50,146
<b>Try and make it work!</b>

466
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:53,045
<b>Forget it. He's not into me.</b>

467
00:27:53,069 --> 00:27:54,976
<b>I'd rather he bring meat
like last time.</b>

468
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,140
<b>Why would he
give me something I can't eat?</b>

469
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:00,109
<b>They smell nice, though.</b>

470
00:28:00,509 --> 00:28:01,910
<b>Where should I put these?</b>

471
00:28:02,509 --> 00:28:03,910
<b>Do we have a vase?</b>

472
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:09,519
<b>My goodness.</b>

473
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:12,519
<b>She's playing
hard to get, isn't she?</b>

474
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:15,765
<b>Her swaying hips mean yes.</b>

475
00:28:15,789 --> 00:28:17,359
<b>But she says no.</b>

476
00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:19,606
<b>She's definitely playing
hard to get.</b>

477
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:20,630
<b>She is.</b>

478
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:23,045
<b>Let's go inside.</b>

479
00:28:23,069 --> 00:28:24,829
<b>It's just practice,
so don't hurt yourselves.</b>

480
00:28:26,599 --> 00:28:28,876
<b>Today, we'll just test
the camera angles...</b>

481
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:31,146
<b>and practice the moves,
so don't get too nervous.</b>

482
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:32,910
<b>Yes, sir. Don't worry.</b>

483
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,710
<b>Bye.</b>

484
00:28:37,309 --> 00:28:39,819
<b>Relax. Why are you so tense?</b>

485
00:28:40,019 --> 00:28:41,856
<b>You'll become stiff
and mess up everything.</b>

486
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,650
<b>It's just that
the suit is a little thin.</b>

487
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,065
<b>- Joon Seon.
- What?</b>

488
00:28:47,089 --> 00:28:49,930
<b>You should relax.
Your face is too pale.</b>

489
00:28:50,289 --> 00:28:51,565
<b>- Is it?
- Yes.</b>

490
00:28:51,589 --> 00:28:54,059
<b>Did I put on too much makeup?</b>

491
00:28:54,329 --> 00:28:55,505
<b>Standby!</b>

492
00:28:55,529 --> 00:28:56,769
<b>Okay! Okay.</b>

493
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,710
<b>Ready.</b>

494
00:29:07,809 --> 00:29:08,880
<b>Action!</b>

495
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:20,019
<b>Cut! That's fine.</b>

496
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:22,789
<b>Stunt doubles. Take your places.</b>

497
00:29:34,099 --> 00:29:35,140
<b>Go!</b>

498
00:30:08,299 --> 00:30:11,410
<b>Cut! Okay! Wow.</b>

499
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:14,515
<b>I'd like you to do just that
for the shoot.</b>

500
00:30:14,539 --> 00:30:15,980
<b>Yes, director! Thank you!</b>

501
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:20,750
<b>Yes.</b>

502
00:30:20,849 --> 00:30:22,549
<b>Come with me.</b>

503
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:24,589
<b>You did great.</b>

504
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:32,089
<b>Why isn't anyone else here?
It's almost 7 p.m.</b>

505
00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:35,200
<b>Don't be silly.</b>

506
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,869
<b>Oh? Ms. Song?</b>

507
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:39,529
<b>Mr. Yoon.</b>

508
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:41,240
<b>Ms. Song!</b>

509
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:44,140
<b>It's so nice to see you here.</b>

510
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:46,585
<b>- Why are you here?
- I'm waiting for my sister.</b>

511
00:30:46,609 --> 00:30:48,886
<b>The women of the house
are eating out.</b>

512
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:50,186
<b>With mom and Ga Hee too.</b>

513
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:52,656
<b>Wow, your family gets along well.</b>

514
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,956
<b>Ours is still a bit icy.</b>

515
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:56,525
<b>How did you manage that day?
After your mother called.</b>

516
00:30:56,549 --> 00:30:58,690
<b>We got over it somehow.</b>

517
00:30:58,789 --> 00:31:00,666
<b>What about you?
Did your sister yell at you?</b>

518
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:02,119
<b>I managed too.</b>

519
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:05,160
<b>You should go.
Your colleague's waiting.</b>

520
00:31:05,329 --> 00:31:06,799
<b>Okay. See you.</b>

521
00:31:08,029 --> 00:31:10,206
<b>Eat something nice.</b>

522
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:11,406
<b>- I will.
- Bye.</b>

523
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:12,500
<b>Bye.</b>

524
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,670
<b>Na Hee.</b>

525
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:19,809
<b>- Da Hee.
- Na Hee.</b>

526
00:31:19,869 --> 00:31:21,616
<b>I was about to call you.</b>

527
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,755
<b>Mom and Ga Hee just got off the bus.</b>

528
00:31:23,779 --> 00:31:25,186
<b>We can meet them nearby. Let's go.</b>

529
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:26,250
<b>Let's.</b>

530
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,896
<b>It's so good.</b>

531
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,696
<b>How is it, Mom? It's nice, isn't it?</b>

532
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:35,466
<b>Yes. I love this place
because I don't smell any oil.</b>

533
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:36,789
<b>And the fish is fresh.</b>

534
00:31:37,589 --> 00:31:40,500
<b>Eat a lot. Ga Hee
and Da Hee, you too.</b>

535
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:43,206
<b>I'm stuffing my face as we speak.</b>

536
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:44,369
<b>Don't make me talk.</b>

537
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:47,670
<b>The tempura is so crunchy.</b>

538
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:50,616
<b>I just love this.</b>

539
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,985
<b>Eating good food
with Mom and my sisters,</b>

540
00:31:53,009 --> 00:31:54,980
<b>and chatting and giggling.</b>

541
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:57,849
<b>Yes. We should've
been like this before.</b>

542
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:00,456
<b>Things were too gloomy between us.</b>

543
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,525
<b>Yes. I had to
tiptoe around you two...</b>

544
00:32:02,549 --> 00:32:04,089
<b>and could barely breathe.</b>

545
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:05,920
<b>- Right, Ga Hee?
- That's right.</b>

546
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:08,420
<b>Those two are mocking us, Mom.</b>

547
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,706
<b>They are. You're nasty brats.</b>

548
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:13,976
<b>Anyway, let's all
forget about the past...</b>

549
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,136
<b>and go back to being a tight group.</b>

550
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,476
<b>Shall we toast to that?</b>

551
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,477
<b>Sure.</b>

552
00:32:18,501 --> 00:32:21,376
<b>To the friendship of
the four ladies of the Song family!</b>

553
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,039
<b>- Cheers!
- Cheers!</b>

554
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:28,410
<b>Excuse me. I'm sorry to bother you.</b>

555
00:32:28,809 --> 00:32:31,650
<b>Yes? What do you want?</b>

556
00:32:32,779 --> 00:32:35,180
<b>I work at
a nearby securities company.</b>

557
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:37,349
<b>I'm here to have dinner
with some colleagues,</b>

558
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:39,950
<b>but then I saw you four having fun.</b>

559
00:32:40,289 --> 00:32:44,160
<b>If it's not too much trouble,
how about you join us for a drink?</b>

560
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:46,529
<b>My gosh.</b>

561
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:49,799
<b>Goodness me. Really?</b>

562
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:53,400
<b>Are you sure
my age won't be a problem?</b>

563
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,000
<b>Sorry about that. Excuse me.</b>

564
00:32:56,970 --> 00:32:58,745
<b>There's no need to apologize.
It's fine.</b>

565
00:32:58,769 --> 00:33:01,940
<b>You could stay for a chat.</b>

566
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:05,750
<b>Unbelievable.</b>

567
00:33:05,849 --> 00:33:07,726
<b>I guess I'm still attractive.</b>

568
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:11,025
<b>Look at him blushing.
We must've shocked him.</b>

569
00:33:11,049 --> 00:33:14,295
<b>Good for you, Mom.
A young man just asked you out.</b>

570
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:16,190
<b>You must be pleased with yourself.</b>

571
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:19,559
<b>Being with my daughters
has its perks.</b>

572
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:24,245
<b>I wonder if the men of our house
have managed to cook dinner.</b>

573
00:33:24,269 --> 00:33:26,876
<b>I'm sure they're already
enjoying theirs. Cheers.</b>

574
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:29,045
<b>- Sure.
- Why not? Cheers.</b>

575
00:33:29,069 --> 00:33:31,716
<b>- Cheers.
- Cheers.</b>

576
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:33,140
<b>I'm loving this.</b>

577
00:33:35,579 --> 00:33:36,809
<b>Gosh.</b>

578
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:39,609
<b>Joon Seon, when will we have dinner?</b>

579
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:42,019
<b>It's almost done, Dad.</b>

580
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:46,119
<b>What's taking you so long?
All we needed was a simple stew.</b>

581
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:47,666
<b>Look forward to it, Dad.</b>

582
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:50,960
<b>Just so you know,
we'll be having spaghetti vongole.</b>

583
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:53,730
<b>What? Vongole?</b>

584
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:57,745
<b>Ji Hun, what on earth
did he mean by that?</b>

585
00:33:57,769 --> 00:33:59,946
<b>It's a spaghetti dish
made with clams.</b>

586
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:01,000
<b>It's quite delicious.</b>

587
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:12,079
<b>Something's wrong with the clams.
They won't open up.</b>

588
00:34:12,349 --> 00:34:14,450
<b>What? Let me take a look.</b>

589
00:34:14,579 --> 00:34:18,389
<b>Joon Seon gave you an order,
so open up!</b>

590
00:34:18,619 --> 00:34:20,119
<b>Seriously?</b>

591
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:22,190
<b>Are you kidding me?</b>

592
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,106
<b>Bring it on.</b>

593
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:26,566
<b>- Let me try.
- We don't have the time.</b>

594
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:27,736
<b>Let's just cook them.</b>

595
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,936
<b>I'm sure they'll taste the same.</b>

596
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,006
<b>Hurry up, guys.
My dad must be hungry.</b>

597
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:33,500
<b>- Sure.
- Get cooking.</b>

598
00:34:34,269 --> 00:34:36,440
<b>What else should go in here?</b>

599
00:34:39,369 --> 00:34:42,280
<b>What's up with the spaghetti?
It's stringy.</b>

600
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:47,349
<b>It must be because
we cooked them for so long.</b>

601
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:48,956
<b>Wait, shouldn't it get mushy?</b>

602
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:51,226
<b>Joon Seon,
this doesn't smell like oil.</b>

603
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:52,930
<b>I think it's a plum extract.
What do we do?</b>

604
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:54,489
<b>What now?</b>

605
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,829
<b>I knew it.</b>

606
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,400
<b>This place serves
the best jajangmyeon.</b>

607
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:05,405
<b>Right? Isn't it to die for?</b>

608
00:35:05,429 --> 00:35:07,276
<b>Yes, it's delicious.</b>

609
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,840
<b>The fried dumplings are the best.</b>

610
00:35:09,539 --> 00:35:11,046
<b>Everything tastes good
when you're hungry.</b>

611
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:12,570
<b>It's way past dinner time.</b>

612
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:14,015
<b>- Shut it.
- Seriously?</b>

613
00:35:14,039 --> 00:35:16,010
<b>Let's eat in peace.</b>

614
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,849
<b>I don't want to hear another word.</b>

615
00:35:18,679 --> 00:35:19,750
<b>- Sure.
- Got it.</b>

616
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:29,119
<b>What a luxurious evening.</b>

617
00:35:29,289 --> 00:35:32,429
<b>I enjoyed sushi
and an expensive bottle of sake.</b>

618
00:35:33,329 --> 00:35:35,936
<b>I feel like I missed out though.</b>

619
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:38,570
<b>We should've drunk
with those group of men.</b>

620
00:35:38,929 --> 00:35:42,776
<b>Seriously?
I'm going to tell Dad, you know.</b>

621
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,686
<b>That's not what I mean.</b>

622
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:47,610
<b>I should've for the sake
of my three single daughters.</b>

623
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:50,756
<b>A securities company
means stable and secure jobs.</b>

624
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:52,750
<b>It's too bad.</b>

625
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:56,179
<b>Why do we suddenly
feel like sinners?</b>

626
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:58,726
<b>We are, aren't we?</b>

627
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:02,360
<b>We're the reason behind
Mom's growing wrinkles.</b>

628
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,936
<b>I'm sorry...</b>

629
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,276
<b>for adding wrinkles
to your pretty face.</b>

630
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,706
<b>It's fine, so shut it.</b>

631
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:12,769
<b>Take me out like this sometimes
if you're that sorry.</b>

632
00:36:13,429 --> 00:36:16,139
<b>Of course I'd love for you
to find love again,</b>

633
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:18,769
<b>but it's not something
you can force.</b>

634
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:22,686
<b>That much we can do.
How about once a month?</b>

635
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:23,785
<b>It'll be on me.</b>

636
00:36:23,809 --> 00:36:26,750
<b>Don't be ridiculous.
Aren't I the older sister?</b>

637
00:36:26,949 --> 00:36:28,719
<b>I'll at least pay 10 percent.</b>

638
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:32,095
<b>You don't have a job,
so all you have to do is attend.</b>

639
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:34,765
<b>I'm thinking of changing that.</b>

640
00:36:34,789 --> 00:36:36,195
<b>I'm going to look for a job.</b>

641
00:36:36,219 --> 00:36:38,289
<b>- Really?
- Yes.</b>

642
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:39,936
<b>I wouldn't mind the extra money...</b>

643
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,329
<b>and it's a shame to waste
my beauty and brain.</b>

644
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:45,630
<b>That's something pleasant to hear.</b>

645
00:36:45,969 --> 00:36:49,199
<b>So this came to mind just now.</b>

646
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:53,215
<b>I might get busy starting tomorrow,
so how about another round?</b>

647
00:36:53,239 --> 00:36:55,639
<b>This cart bar serves
the best rolled omelet.</b>

648
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:58,456
<b>I'm already tipsy though.</b>

649
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,825
<b>Another drink might
interfere with my studies tomorrow.</b>

650
00:37:00,849 --> 00:37:02,456
<b>Come on.</b>

651
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,195
<b>Leave it to tomorrow
to worry about tomorrow.</b>

652
00:37:04,219 --> 00:37:06,026
<b>Besides, you need to recharge
in order to study.</b>

653
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:07,095
<b>Let's get another drink.</b>

654
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:08,495
<b>- Sure, let's go.
- Nice!</b>

655
00:37:08,519 --> 00:37:10,706
<b>- I'm in!
- Girls, it's too late.</b>

656
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:12,206
<b>Your father will be waiting for us.</b>

657
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,736
<b>Mom, come on.</b>

658
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,436
<b>- You're a free woman today.
- Let's go.</b>

659
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:18,376
<b>- Okay, fine.
- Come on.</b>

660
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,606
<b>Over here.</b>

661
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:23,039
<b>All right. Fine, I'm coming.</b>

662
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:25,686
<b>- Come on.
- Let's go.</b>

663
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:28,055
<b>- Here.
- Come on.</b>

664
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,215
<b>Watch your step.</b>

665
00:37:29,239 --> 00:37:31,010
<b>What's with the ruckus?</b>

666
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:33,250
<b>It's not like
they own the neighborhood.</b>

667
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:51,609
<b>(Episode 34)</b>

668
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:02,889
<b>My darn sons.</b>

669
00:38:03,889 --> 00:38:06,389
<b>I should've at least
had one daughter.</b>

670
00:38:46,459 --> 00:38:48,505
<b>Seo Jin, you're here!</b>

671
00:38:48,529 --> 00:38:50,115
<b>I'm always so sorry about this.</b>

672
00:38:50,139 --> 00:38:52,045
<b>I know it's you
who watches her the longest.</b>

673
00:38:52,069 --> 00:38:54,509
<b>Don't mention it. I'm jobless,
so it's the least I can do.</b>

674
00:38:54,869 --> 00:38:57,809
<b>Seo Jin, we'll have fun today
like we always do, okay?</b>

675
00:38:59,979 --> 00:39:02,256
<b>Here you go. It's for kids
two grades above Ji Hun,</b>

676
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,756
<b>but he won't find it that hard.</b>

677
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:07,520
<b>Hyun Gyung, thanks for
always looking out for him.</b>

678
00:39:09,089 --> 00:39:10,160
<b>Goodness.</b>

679
00:39:12,619 --> 00:39:13,660
<b>What?</b>

680
00:39:13,789 --> 00:39:14,789
<b>Go.</b>

681
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:16,759
<b>Get inside.</b>

682
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,806
<b>Seo Jin, let's head inside.</b>

683
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:22,330
<b>- Bye, Hyun Gyung.
- Bye.</b>

684
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:29,339
<b>I feel like this new series
will work out for me.</b>

685
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,886
<b>We rehearsed yesterday...</b>

686
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:33,610
<b>and the director was pleased.
I feel good about it too.</b>

687
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:35,856
<b>Really? I'm glad.</b>

688
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,356
<b>So I was wondering...</b>

689
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:39,850
<b>if you could let me
keep my promise to Seo Young.</b>

690
00:39:40,949 --> 00:39:45,759
<b>Let us go out for dinner
as a family.</b>

691
00:39:46,059 --> 00:39:48,089
<b>I wanted to treat the kids
to something delicious.</b>

692
00:39:50,399 --> 00:39:52,160
<b>Could you allow that?</b>

693
00:39:52,399 --> 00:39:54,446
<b>Sure. Let's go out for dinner.</b>

694
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:55,447
<b>Really?</b>

695
00:39:55,471 --> 00:39:56,799
<b>Let me know when and where.</b>

696
00:39:57,370 --> 00:40:00,515
<b>Just so you know,
Seo Young's craving cream spaghetti.</b>

697
00:40:00,539 --> 00:40:02,370
<b>Cream spaghetti? And you?</b>

698
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:04,015
<b>What about you?</b>

699
00:40:04,039 --> 00:40:05,656
<b>What does Seo Jin like?</b>

700
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,180
<b>I'll buy everything you want.</b>

701
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:10,949
<b>How many of our patients
are booking in advance?</b>

702
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:15,019
<b>We're allowing 60 percent
of our patients to book in advance.</b>

703
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:19,419
<b>What do you all say
to increase that...</b>

704
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:22,160
<b>to about 70 percent?</b>

705
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,036
<b>Patients have been complaining...</b>

706
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:27,169
<b>about having to wait too long
on the spot.</b>

707
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:29,930
<b>Increasing the number
to 70 percent...</b>

708
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:33,000
<b>will help us be more efficient.</b>

709
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,310
<b>It sounds like a good idea.</b>

710
00:40:35,509 --> 00:40:37,979
<b>I have been receiving
many complaints too.</b>

711
00:40:38,539 --> 00:40:41,525
<b>Then let's give it a try
and see how it works...</b>

712
00:40:41,549 --> 00:40:44,449
<b>I don't agree, Director Lee.</b>

713
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:51,919
<b>Go ahead, Dr. Yoon.</b>

714
00:40:52,519 --> 00:40:55,930
<b>Many kids in this neighborhood
are being watched by grandparents.</b>

715
00:40:56,259 --> 00:41:00,299
<b>They'll find it difficult
to book for our service in advance.</b>

716
00:41:01,669 --> 00:41:04,316
<b>Isn't an increase in 10 percent
a reasonable compromise though?</b>

717
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:05,870
<b>Actually, that's a large number.</b>

718
00:41:06,569 --> 00:41:08,946
<b>Especially children
from lower-income households...</b>

719
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:11,280
<b>who come to us because
of our welfare program...</b>

720
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:15,109
<b>might not have access
to the Internet at home.</b>

721
00:41:15,609 --> 00:41:18,250
<b>Then we'll allow bookings via phone.</b>

722
00:41:18,479 --> 00:41:20,166
<b>I'm sure they can
at least make calls.</b>

723
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:21,750
<b>We already have
that system in place.</b>

724
00:41:22,819 --> 00:41:25,596
<b>It's just a given fact that
people of the older generation...</b>

725
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:27,465
<b>prefer to come in
instead of booking appointments.</b>

726
00:41:27,489 --> 00:41:31,759
<b>They find the entire
booking system to be foreign.</b>

727
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:37,076
<b>Wouldn't it be better
to educate them on the system then?</b>

728
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,370
<b>For the long run, I mean.</b>

729
00:41:38,769 --> 00:41:42,639
<b>Why is this something
we must push through?</b>

730
00:41:48,579 --> 00:41:51,120
<b>Then we'll think about it some more.</b>

731
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:53,180
<b>That'll be the end
of today's meeting.</b>

732
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:04,499
<b>What Dr. Yoon said earlier
applies specifically...</b>

733
00:42:04,559 --> 00:42:07,145
<b>to the nature of this district.</b>

734
00:42:07,169 --> 00:42:10,799
<b>Of course it's more efficient to
increase the percentage of bookings.</b>

735
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:14,616
<b>However, once you deal
with the grandparents,</b>

736
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:18,710
<b>you get to understand
where they're coming from...</b>

737
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:21,950
<b>Why are you laughing?</b>

738
00:42:23,309 --> 00:42:24,580
<b>It's nothing.</b>

739
00:42:24,919 --> 00:42:25,955
<b>I'm just amused by...</b>

740
00:42:25,979 --> 00:42:28,189
<b>how passionately
you're speaking up for Gyu Jin.</b>

741
00:42:29,289 --> 00:42:33,236
<b>I didn't want you
to be bothered by what he said.</b>

742
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:35,165
<b>Well, I'm not.</b>

743
00:42:35,189 --> 00:42:37,960
<b>We don't have to agree on everything
so I understand.</b>

744
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,999
<b>Then I'm glad.</b>

745
00:42:40,369 --> 00:42:43,840
<b>I'm more worried about
eating lunch alone today.</b>

746
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:45,369
<b>You'll join me, right?</b>

747
00:42:46,499 --> 00:42:48,010
<b>I'll call you later.</b>

748
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:08,129
<b>Are you kidding me?</b>

749
00:43:09,189 --> 00:43:10,260
<b>Gyu Jin,</b>

750
00:43:11,059 --> 00:43:12,700
<b>don't you think you overreacted?</b>

751
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:13,999
<b>What do you mean?</b>

752
00:43:14,229 --> 00:43:15,700
<b>With Director Lee.</b>

753
00:43:16,299 --> 00:43:18,700
<b>It's not like you to get emotional.</b>

754
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:22,140
<b>As if. You're the one
who's making it a big deal.</b>

755
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:26,556
<b>I'm your brother, Gyu Jin. By blood.</b>

756
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:28,910
<b>I can tell when you're not yourself.</b>

757
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:33,749
<b>It's because of Na Hee, right?
Something's up between them.</b>

758
00:43:35,489 --> 00:43:37,696
<b>I don't know.
But so what if there is?</b>

759
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:39,189
<b>It's none of my business now.</b>

760
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:41,566
<b>Gyu Jin.</b>

761
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:43,835
<b>Apologize when you
get the chance, okay?</b>

762
00:43:43,859 --> 00:43:46,306
<b>I'm sure he was bothered by it.</b>

763
00:43:46,330 --> 00:43:48,046
<b>You talked back
in front of his subordinates.</b>

764
00:43:48,070 --> 00:43:50,310
<b>An interim director is still
a director of this hospital.</b>

765
00:43:53,499 --> 00:43:54,539
<b>I'll get going.</b>

766
00:44:00,410 --> 00:44:01,510
<b>Unbelievable.</b>

767
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:05,280
<b>I'm going.</b>

768
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:13,366
<b>- Have a good day.
- You too.</b>

769
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:15,559
<b>- Sir, can you sign this?
- Sure.</b>

770
00:44:18,330 --> 00:44:19,835
<b>Got it. Have a good day.</b>

771
00:44:19,859 --> 00:44:21,169
<b>- You too.
- Sure.</b>

772
00:44:28,169 --> 00:44:29,186
<b>Sorry about that.</b>

773
00:44:29,210 --> 00:44:32,580
<b>It's nothing. Have a good day then.</b>

774
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:40,650
<b>Thank you.</b>

775
00:44:41,850 --> 00:44:42,850
<b>My gosh.</b>

776
00:44:43,689 --> 00:44:45,866
<b>Again? But you got
me flowers yesterday.</b>

777
00:44:45,890 --> 00:44:48,370
<b>Just because you eat today
doesn't mean you shouldn't tomorrow.</b>

778
00:44:48,859 --> 00:44:51,299
<b>Roses keep reminding me of you.</b>

779
00:44:52,030 --> 00:44:53,260
<b>Just you wait and see.</b>

780
00:44:53,499 --> 00:44:57,140
<b>I'll fill up the store with roses
in no time.</b>

781
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:01,239
<b>What use does a kimbap place have
for all these roses?</b>

782
00:45:01,869 --> 00:45:03,486
<b>Aren't you hot though?</b>

783
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:05,256
<b>It gets sweaty in leather items.</b>

784
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,626
<b>I'm not sweating at all.</b>

785
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:10,756
<b>Anyway, here's to another good day.</b>

786
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:12,679
<b>Young and fresh!</b>

787
00:45:27,129 --> 00:45:30,446
<b>I could see him sweat,
but he says he isn't sweating.</b>

788
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:32,200
<b>What now?</b>

789
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:34,946
<b>You should tell him, Cho Yeon.</b>

790
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:36,845
<b>Wearing a leather jacket
and riding a motorcycle...</b>

791
00:45:36,869 --> 00:45:38,785
<b>doesn't make you a pretty boy.</b>

792
00:45:38,809 --> 00:45:42,049
<b>Let him be. I can't tell him
to stop what he enjoys.</b>

793
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:45,820
<b>There's an adorable side to him.</b>

794
00:45:51,789 --> 00:45:53,395
<b>Hello,</b>

795
00:45:53,419 --> 00:45:56,105
<b>I'm here to bring you
words of wisdom.</b>

796
00:45:56,129 --> 00:45:57,299
<b>Dad!</b>

797
00:45:59,729 --> 00:46:01,530
<b>The room's too small, isn't it?</b>

798
00:46:02,570 --> 00:46:04,770
<b>The rest had to be allocated
to the diner.</b>

799
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:08,669
<b>It's big enough
for just one person.</b>

800
00:46:10,109 --> 00:46:12,679
<b>Also, the flowers smell amazing.</b>

801
00:46:14,479 --> 00:46:17,549
<b>I moved to a fun neighborhood, Dad.</b>

802
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:21,050
<b>Who knew that flowers
could blossom on a dead tree?</b>

803
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:24,166
<b>Some guy has been bringing
me flowers because he likes me.</b>

804
00:46:24,190 --> 00:46:26,920
<b>Is that so? That's nice to hear.</b>

805
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:29,960
<b>How do you feel about him then?</b>

806
00:46:30,229 --> 00:46:32,076
<b>He's not that bad...</b>

807
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:33,430
<b>and he's quite down-to-earth.</b>

808
00:46:34,229 --> 00:46:36,576
<b>There's a manliness
to his good looks too.</b>

809
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:39,475
<b>Then you should make it work.</b>

810
00:46:39,499 --> 00:46:41,869
<b>I'm seeing how it plays out for now.</b>

811
00:46:42,269 --> 00:46:45,786
<b>You know I'm skeptical
when it comes to men.</b>

812
00:46:45,810 --> 00:46:47,855
<b>I've dealt with
my fair share of morons,</b>

813
00:46:47,879 --> 00:46:49,279
<b>so I'm taking my time for now.</b>

814
00:46:49,509 --> 00:46:53,550
<b>Also, it's not charming for a woman
to accept one's love so fast.</b>

815
00:46:53,749 --> 00:46:55,625
<b>You need to play hard to get.</b>

816
00:46:55,649 --> 00:46:59,119
<b>Goodness. What if he gets tired
and moves on?</b>

817
00:46:59,690 --> 00:47:00,835
<b>Don't worry, Dad.</b>

818
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:03,830
<b>Your daughter is an expert
when it comes to men.</b>

819
00:47:04,899 --> 00:47:08,670
<b>I see that spring
has found my daughter's face.</b>

820
00:47:09,629 --> 00:47:11,776
<b>It must be a good sign.</b>

821
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,909
<b>You said that last year too,
remember?</b>

822
00:47:14,009 --> 00:47:15,470
<b>All you do is lie.</b>

823
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:19,279
<b>It's all part of the journey.</b>

824
00:47:20,649 --> 00:47:23,409
<b>Life may seem tough for you,</b>

825
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:27,590
<b>but it'll deliver
a gift to you someday...</b>

826
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:31,359
<b>just like it led me to you.</b>

827
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,960
<b>You keep getting better
with your words, don't you?</b>

828
00:47:36,259 --> 00:47:39,259
<b>If you weren't a monk,
you'd have broken a lot of hearts.</b>

829
00:47:41,830 --> 00:47:42,899
<b>Here you go.</b>

830
00:47:49,070 --> 00:47:50,139
<b>Sir?</b>

831
00:47:50,879 --> 00:47:53,540
<b>- My gosh.
- Goodness, it's you.</b>

832
00:47:53,950 --> 00:47:55,979
<b>I can't believe I ran into you here.</b>

833
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:58,149
<b>- What brings you by?
- Well...</b>

834
00:47:58,249 --> 00:48:00,396
<b>I'm here to meet a friendly face,</b>

835
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:02,519
<b>but I didn't expect
to run into you too.</b>

836
00:48:03,389 --> 00:48:05,659
<b>I was able to meet
two precious spirits today...</b>

837
00:48:05,790 --> 00:48:09,235
<b>which can only be categorized
as an extraordinary event.</b>

838
00:48:09,259 --> 00:48:10,489
<b>Goodness.</b>

839
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:13,859
<b>- Have you been well?
- As you can see, yes.</b>

840
00:48:14,369 --> 00:48:16,005
<b>I'll see you around then.</b>

841
00:48:16,029 --> 00:48:18,769
<b>Sure thing.
Please have a safe trip back.</b>

842
00:48:25,379 --> 00:48:28,279
<b>He looks like he lost weight
every time I see him.</b>

843
00:48:28,879 --> 00:48:30,550
<b>This won't do.</b>

844
00:48:30,619 --> 00:48:32,796
<b>I should make
the perilla leaf pickles he likes...</b>

845
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:34,220
<b>and take it to him tomorrow.</b>

846
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:36,290
<b>I feel awful.</b>

847
00:48:36,389 --> 00:48:38,519
<b>Are we taking the day off then?</b>

848
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:41,066
<b>In your dreams.</b>

849
00:48:41,090 --> 00:48:43,859
<b>We'll need to prep the ingredients
before she comes in.</b>

850
00:48:44,999 --> 00:48:46,676
<b>Hello, everyone.</b>

851
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:49,146
<b>- Hello, Mr. Song.
- Hi.</b>

852
00:48:49,170 --> 00:48:50,306
<b>What brings you by?</b>

853
00:48:50,330 --> 00:48:51,776
<b>I'm here to get your approval...</b>

854
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:54,286
<b>for the eco-friendly
food waste disposer.</b>

855
00:48:54,310 --> 00:48:55,786
<b>Should I sign it?</b>

856
00:48:55,810 --> 00:48:56,970
<b>Just a second.</b>

857
00:48:57,810 --> 00:49:00,955
<b>Did you have a visitor?
The tea smells nice.</b>

858
00:49:00,979 --> 00:49:03,479
<b>My dad stopped by a few minutes ago.</b>

859
00:49:04,450 --> 00:49:06,249
<b>I see.</b>

860
00:49:06,879 --> 00:49:08,566
<b>- Here you go.
- Thanks.</b>

861
00:49:08,590 --> 00:49:10,796
<b>You're working hard like always.</b>

862
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:12,420
<b>I hardly think that's true.</b>

863
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:16,090
<b>Hold on. Hasn't Chi Su
been by today?</b>

864
00:49:16,989 --> 00:49:19,560
<b>He already came by!</b>

865
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:24,146
<b>He bought her
a bouquet of 100 roses.</b>

866
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:26,499
<b>One yesterday and one today.</b>

867
00:49:26,869 --> 00:49:30,369
<b>It's true how one falls harder
later in their years.</b>

868
00:49:31,710 --> 00:49:34,255
<b>Give my friend of 10 years
a chance, okay?</b>

869
00:49:34,279 --> 00:49:37,379
<b>I can't speak for everything else,
but he's truly a decent man.</b>

870
00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:39,619
<b>Well...</b>

871
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:42,196
<b>Anyway, have a good day.</b>

872
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:43,326
<b>- Bye.
- I'll see you around.</b>

873
00:49:43,350 --> 00:49:44,735
<b>- Bye.
- See you.</b>

874
00:49:44,759 --> 00:49:46,335
<b>Have a good day.</b>

875
00:49:46,359 --> 00:49:48,889
<b>Gosh, why is everyone trying
to pressure me?</b>

876
00:49:49,859 --> 00:49:51,830
<b>Anyway, let's open up the diner.</b>

877
00:49:52,159 --> 00:49:55,005
<b>Stop that, you two.
Ju Ri, blanch the spinach.</b>

878
00:49:55,029 --> 00:49:56,330
<b>Ga Yeon, chop the carrots.</b>

879
00:49:56,830 --> 00:49:59,115
<b>Okay. I will.</b>

880
00:49:59,139 --> 00:50:00,470
<b>Let's go.</b>

881
00:50:05,779 --> 00:50:08,749
<b>Here. This is your favorite,
cream spaghetti.</b>

882
00:50:08,810 --> 00:50:11,119
<b>Have some steak too.
I'll cut it for you.</b>

883
00:50:11,379 --> 00:50:13,855
<b>Dad. I forgot to bring oil paints...</b>

884
00:50:13,879 --> 00:50:15,889
<b>for the art class today.</b>

885
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:17,735
<b>Really? What did you do?</b>

886
00:50:17,759 --> 00:50:20,396
<b>So I went to the stationary shop
in front of the school.</b>

887
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:22,766
<b>And I found photo cards
of GOT7 there.</b>

888
00:50:22,790 --> 00:50:25,629
<b>What can I do? I'm a big fan.
So I had to buy them.</b>

889
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:28,529
<b>I just braced myself for scolding
and bought them.</b>

890
00:50:31,470 --> 00:50:33,100
<b>You know my friend
who sits next to me.</b>

891
00:50:33,239 --> 00:50:35,345
<b>I told you about him before.
He's Oh Jae Min.</b>

892
00:50:35,369 --> 00:50:36,946
<b>Oh, right.</b>

893
00:50:36,970 --> 00:50:40,686
<b>He brought extra oil paints
for me. Isn't that amazing?</b>

894
00:50:40,710 --> 00:50:43,580
<b>Gosh, he sounds very sweet.</b>

895
00:50:44,519 --> 00:50:48,050
<b>You should have some steak.
You've lost weight recently.</b>

896
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:53,865
<b>And he gave his pastels to me.</b>

897
00:50:53,889 --> 00:50:56,129
<b>That's when I realized it.</b>

898
00:50:56,529 --> 00:50:58,129
<b>He has feelings for me.</b>

899
00:50:58,859 --> 00:51:01,946
<b>Why would he give me art supplies
when he doesn't like me?</b>

900
00:51:01,970 --> 00:51:04,745
<b>You're right. He really does
have an eye for people.</b>

901
00:51:04,769 --> 00:51:06,840
<b>My daughter is pretty.</b>

902
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:12,479
<b>If he takes good care of me,
it means he likes me. Right?</b>

903
00:51:13,210 --> 00:51:15,286
<b>Stop talking and eat your food.</b>

904
00:51:15,310 --> 00:51:17,379
<b>You said you wanted
to eat out as a family.</b>

905
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:19,156
<b>Are you here to chat away?</b>

906
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:21,149
<b>Yes. This is what I wanted to do.</b>

907
00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:23,850
<b>Sit around together
and have a chat over a meal.</b>

908
00:51:24,690 --> 00:51:27,889
<b>So how do you feel?
Do you not like Jae Min?</b>

909
00:51:29,489 --> 00:51:32,729
<b>Well... He's not bad,
but he's not my type.</b>

910
00:51:33,259 --> 00:51:34,776
<b>I like tall guys.</b>

911
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,269
<b>I don't like it that I'm short.</b>

912
00:51:37,399 --> 00:51:41,040
<b>And I like guys with single eyelids
who are chic.</b>

913
00:51:42,070 --> 00:51:44,286
<b>There's no need to explain more.</b>

914
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:45,879
<b>I like a guy just like him.</b>

915
00:51:47,279 --> 00:51:48,649
<b>Hyo Sin.</b>

916
00:51:49,379 --> 00:51:51,926
<b>Hey. You said your ideal type is me.</b>

917
00:51:51,950 --> 00:51:52,927
<b>I just said it...</b>

918
00:51:52,951 --> 00:51:54,296
<b>- to make you feel good.
- Gosh.</b>

919
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,796
<b>Is he doing well?
Did he not ask you about me?</b>

920
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:59,396
<b>He didn't. He's not
interested in you at all.</b>

921
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:02,666
<b>You're just jealous. You're so cute
when you feel jealous.</b>

922
00:52:02,690 --> 00:52:03,759
<b>Gosh.</b>

923
00:52:06,499 --> 00:52:08,676
<b>Excuse me. Can you take
a picture of us?</b>

924
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:10,869
<b>Our family is eating out together.</b>

925
00:52:11,639 --> 00:52:12,639
<b>Okay.</b>

926
00:52:13,639 --> 00:52:15,170
<b>- Please come closer.
- Okay.</b>

927
00:52:15,409 --> 00:52:17,909
<b>Mom, come closer. Come here.</b>

928
00:52:18,310 --> 00:52:20,680
<b>I'm taking it now. 1, 2.</b>

929
00:52:27,850 --> 00:52:29,865
<b>Dad, thank you
for dinner today. Bye.</b>

930
00:52:29,889 --> 00:52:32,396
<b>- All right. Text me, Seo Young.
- Okay.</b>

931
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:34,159
<b>Good night, Seo Jin.</b>

932
00:52:34,259 --> 00:52:36,129
<b>- Bye, Dad.
- Bye.</b>

933
00:52:37,259 --> 00:52:38,359
<b>Hyun Gyung.</b>

934
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:41,670
<b>What? Do you have
anything to say?</b>

935
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:44,570
<b>Well... It's nothing special.</b>

936
00:52:44,869 --> 00:52:48,639
<b>Like I said yesterday, I'm feeling
pretty good this time.</b>

937
00:52:49,509 --> 00:52:51,385
<b>To be honest, I was worried...</b>

938
00:52:51,409 --> 00:52:54,379
<b>if I wouldn't get any work
after starting my own business.</b>

939
00:52:54,879 --> 00:52:58,720
<b>Once I do a good job,
it will go viral quickly.</b>

940
00:52:58,779 --> 00:52:59,820
<b>So?</b>

941
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:01,950
<b>Well... I mean...</b>

942
00:53:02,290 --> 00:53:05,690
<b>I think I'll become
financially stable soon.</b>

943
00:53:06,019 --> 00:53:09,389
<b>And we should think
about Seo Young and Seo Jin.</b>

944
00:53:10,389 --> 00:53:12,159
<b>If things go well,</b>

945
00:53:13,499 --> 00:53:15,300
<b>- we might...
- Joon Seon.</b>

946
00:53:15,399 --> 00:53:17,200
<b>Yes, ma'am. I mean, yes.</b>

947
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:19,940
<b>I don't want to talk
about what's already over.</b>

948
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:23,186
<b>I just want you to do things...</b>

949
00:53:23,210 --> 00:53:26,109
<b>that you should do
as Seo Young and Seo Jin's dad.</b>

950
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:30,279
<b>I should go then.</b>

951
00:54:00,879 --> 00:54:02,580
<b>Joon Seon is coming home late.</b>

952
00:54:03,109 --> 00:54:05,779
<b>I guess the dinner is over already.</b>

953
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:08,190
<b>I know. It's past 10 p.m.</b>

954
00:54:09,350 --> 00:54:13,420
<b>Is it that Joon Seon
went home with them?</b>

955
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:17,536
<b>Are they having a great time
as a family?</b>

956
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:20,100
<b>I hope things go well
and they get back together.</b>

957
00:54:20,430 --> 00:54:22,499
<b>He's still in love with his wife.</b>

958
00:54:22,670 --> 00:54:24,715
<b>Sure. He's such a romanticist.</b>

959
00:54:24,739 --> 00:54:26,570
<b>I know it. And the sky knows.</b>

960
00:54:27,239 --> 00:54:30,940
<b>By the way, I think we should lose
some weight to wear a suit.</b>

961
00:54:31,509 --> 00:54:33,609
<b>Shall we try intermediate
fasting or something?</b>

962
00:54:33,710 --> 00:54:36,779
<b>It's intermittent fasting,
not intermediate fasting.</b>

963
00:54:37,979 --> 00:54:39,950
<b>Right. Intermittent fasting.</b>

964
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:41,950
<b>I said intermittent fasting.</b>

965
00:54:42,190 --> 00:54:43,989
<b>You said intermediate fasting.</b>

966
00:54:44,290 --> 00:54:47,159
<b>He's right. I heard it too.
You said intermediate fasting.</b>

967
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:49,989
<b>Hey.</b>

968
00:54:50,330 --> 00:54:53,100
<b>I'm sure I said
intermittent fasting.</b>

969
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:54,869
<b>Are you deaf or what?</b>

970
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,845
<b>Stop accusing an innocent person
and go pick your ears. And you...</b>

971
00:54:57,869 --> 00:55:01,286
<b>You're home, Joon Seon.
They didn't pick their ears.</b>

972
00:55:01,310 --> 00:55:02,669
<b>So I was going to pick them.</b>

973
00:55:03,510 --> 00:55:05,139
<b>Joon Seon, did you enjoy the dinner?</b>

974
00:55:05,310 --> 00:55:07,486
<b>It took a long time.
I bet things went well.</b>

975
00:55:07,510 --> 00:55:09,585
<b>Joon Seon, what did you eat?</b>

976
00:55:09,609 --> 00:55:11,655
<b>Did you go home with them
after dinner?</b>

977
00:55:11,679 --> 00:55:14,865
<b>Did you get to talk to your wife?</b>

978
00:55:14,889 --> 00:55:17,796
<b>Joon Seon, tell us about it.
We were really curious.</b>

979
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:20,060
<b>Let go of me. What? Why?</b>

980
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:38,609
<b>Gosh, I'm feeling nauseous.</b>

981
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:43,310
<b>Ga Hee forced me
to drink soju with beer.</b>

982
00:55:43,949 --> 00:55:46,419
<b>I just wasted the whole day
without studying.</b>

983
00:55:49,090 --> 00:55:52,119
<b>I can't do this.
I should go take some pills.</b>

984
00:55:55,590 --> 00:55:58,506
<b>Hello. I need
some hangover relief pills.</b>

985
00:55:58,530 --> 00:56:00,536
<b>Ms. Choi. My gosh.</b>

986
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:01,830
<b>Gosh, it's cold.</b>

987
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:04,540
<b>What?</b>

988
00:56:05,439 --> 00:56:06,469
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

989
00:56:08,209 --> 00:56:09,639
<b>- Please enjoy.
- Thanks.</b>

990
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:11,939
<b>Please eat, Ms. Choi.</b>

991
00:56:16,050 --> 00:56:19,419
<b>You're not feeling good,
so you haven't eaten all day.</b>

992
00:56:23,149 --> 00:56:24,149
<b>Here.</b>

993
00:56:24,219 --> 00:56:28,760
<b>I've never tried
ox blood soup before.</b>

994
00:56:29,659 --> 00:56:31,835
<b>You should try it. It's good.</b>

995
00:56:31,859 --> 00:56:34,199
<b>Ox blood soup is great
for a hangover.</b>

996
00:57:22,010 --> 00:57:23,409
<b>Ms. Song, with you...</b>

997
00:57:24,310 --> 00:57:27,679
<b>No, we're not in-laws anymore.</b>

998
00:57:29,189 --> 00:57:32,919
<b>I'm not sure if it's okay
to sit here with you.</b>

999
00:57:33,990 --> 00:57:37,629
<b>But I like you. I have
no hard feelings towards you.</b>

1000
00:57:38,129 --> 00:57:42,369
<b>I know. I'm sorry
about Na Hee and Gyu Jin.</b>

1001
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:48,139
<b>I have no one to talk to,
so I'm just frustrated.</b>

1002
00:57:50,270 --> 00:57:53,780
<b>My first son is now a divorced man.</b>

1003
00:57:54,179 --> 00:57:56,149
<b>And my second son is no different.</b>

1004
00:57:56,980 --> 00:57:59,625
<b>I wanted to set him up
with a woman I like,</b>

1005
00:57:59,649 --> 00:58:02,419
<b>but he showed up there
with his girlfriend.</b>

1006
00:58:06,990 --> 00:58:09,135
<b>It turns out he had a girlfriend.</b>

1007
00:58:09,159 --> 00:58:11,506
<b>I don't know who she is though.</b>

1008
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:13,206
<b>I heard she's still a student.</b>

1009
00:58:13,230 --> 00:58:16,469
<b>What does he want to do
with such a young girl?</b>

1010
00:58:17,899 --> 00:58:22,109
<b>I wish she wouldn't be
a selfish wench.</b>

1011
00:58:24,879 --> 00:58:27,109
<b>Oh, it's okay.</b>

1012
00:58:27,310 --> 00:58:29,655
<b>I know Na Hee has that side to her.</b>

1013
00:58:29,679 --> 00:58:31,379
<b>That's how the elders feel
about her.</b>

1014
00:58:31,719 --> 00:58:35,165
<b>I know. Even her sister knows that.</b>

1015
00:58:35,189 --> 00:58:36,490
<b>I knew it.</b>

1016
00:58:37,419 --> 00:58:38,419
<b>Right.</b>

1017
00:58:39,689 --> 00:58:43,429
<b>Anyway, I just can't get
my way with my children.</b>

1018
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:48,800
<b>Life is so vain and empty.</b>

1019
00:58:49,699 --> 00:58:50,699
<b>I see.</b>

1020
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:55,415
<b>When are you going home?</b>

1021
00:58:55,439 --> 00:58:57,645
<b>If you need a ride, come running.</b>

1022
00:58:57,669 --> 00:59:00,486
<b>Gyu Jin, I'm having dinner
with Gi Yeong.</b>

1023
00:59:00,510 --> 00:59:01,585
<b>You go home first.</b>

1024
00:59:01,609 --> 00:59:04,310
<b>You should've told me sooner
so I didn't have to call you.</b>

1025
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:06,449
<b>I'm hanging up.</b>

1026
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:09,020
<b>That fool.</b>

1027
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:33,180
<b>Are you getting off work, Dr. Yoon?</b>

1028
00:59:35,409 --> 00:59:36,480
<b>Yes.</b>

1029
00:59:44,889 --> 00:59:47,060
<b>If you have some time,</b>

1030
00:59:48,189 --> 00:59:49,629
<b>will you go out for a drink with me?</b>

1031
00:59:52,129 --> 00:59:54,000
<b>Well... Okay.</b>

1032
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:01,040
<b>Isn't it nice here?</b>

1033
01:00:01,609 --> 01:00:02,770
<b>I come here a lot.</b>

1034
01:00:05,010 --> 01:00:06,040
<b>I see.</b>

1035
01:00:10,310 --> 01:00:14,919
<b>Earlier on, I think I went too far.
I apologize.</b>

1036
01:00:18,020 --> 01:00:20,619
<b>Leave it. I went too far myself.</b>

1037
01:00:22,290 --> 01:00:24,590
<b>I've worked here for a few years,</b>

1038
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:27,699
<b>and the hospital means a lot to me.</b>

1039
01:00:28,399 --> 01:00:30,770
<b>It wasn't anything personal,</b>

1040
01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:33,600
<b>so don't get the wrong idea.</b>

1041
01:00:35,409 --> 01:00:36,469
<b>Really?</b>

1042
01:00:37,310 --> 01:00:40,379
<b>It was a bit personal for me.</b>

1043
01:00:48,719 --> 01:00:51,359
<b>I like Na Hee.
I have feelings for her.</b>

1044
01:00:54,830 --> 01:00:56,260
<b>I want to make things work,</b>

1045
01:00:56,830 --> 01:00:59,199
<b>but I think she needs more time.</b>

1046
01:01:00,159 --> 01:01:02,929
<b>So I'll approach her slowly,
bit by bit.</b>

1047
01:01:08,070 --> 01:01:11,340
<b>Why are you telling me this?</b>

1048
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:16,350
<b>Because I think you caught on.</b>

1049
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:20,425
<b>Isn't that why
you opposed me so hard?</b>

1050
01:01:20,449 --> 01:01:21,796
<b>No, that was...</b>

1051
01:01:21,820 --> 01:01:23,419
<b>I'm not asking for your permission.</b>

1052
01:01:24,350 --> 01:01:27,619
<b>I just wanted to be forthcoming.</b>

1053
01:01:59,619 --> 01:02:02,335
<b>Why are you buying me dinner anyway?</b>

1054
01:02:02,359 --> 01:02:05,000
<b>Why even ask? It's not a big deal.</b>

1055
01:02:05,629 --> 01:02:07,875
<b>Also, talk freely now.</b>

1056
01:02:07,899 --> 01:02:09,605
<b>You're my university senior.</b>

1057
01:02:09,629 --> 01:02:11,105
<b>I can't do that.</b>

1058
01:02:11,129 --> 01:02:13,976
<b>We're in different departments
and I came to the hospital later.</b>

1059
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,369
<b>Don't you say that.</b>

1060
01:02:17,469 --> 01:02:20,409
<b>Just speak freely.
Treat me comfortably.</b>

1061
01:02:21,139 --> 01:02:24,379
<b>Can I do that? I will, then.</b>

1062
01:02:26,580 --> 01:02:30,189
<b>Speaking casually
does make us feel closer.</b>

1063
01:02:30,689 --> 01:02:31,689
<b>Right, Gi Yeong?</b>

1064
01:02:34,389 --> 01:02:35,859
<b>- Eat some more.
- Thanks.</b>

1065
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:41,199
<b>So, that person we met yesterday.</b>

1066
01:02:41,330 --> 01:02:43,145
<b>Dr. Song's younger sister.</b>

1067
01:02:43,169 --> 01:02:44,629
<b>Who? My in-law?</b>

1068
01:02:44,770 --> 01:02:47,276
<b>Yes, your sister-in-law.</b>

1069
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:50,385
<b>No. Technically,
she's your ex-sister-in-law.</b>

1070
01:02:50,409 --> 01:02:52,439
<b>Yes. What about her?</b>

1071
01:02:54,379 --> 01:02:55,379
<b>Could you...</b>

1072
01:02:56,050 --> 01:02:58,919
<b>set me up with her?</b>

1073
01:02:59,850 --> 01:03:01,419
<b>- What?
- The thing is,</b>

1074
01:03:01,990 --> 01:03:03,389
<b>she's totally my type.</b>

1075
01:03:03,750 --> 01:03:05,790
<b>I can't handle strong women.</b>

1076
01:03:06,119 --> 01:03:09,290
<b>But she looks sweet and docile.</b>

1077
01:03:09,859 --> 01:03:11,159
<b>She's my type.</b>

1078
01:03:12,399 --> 01:03:14,560
<b>I feel really lonely these days.</b>

1079
01:03:14,969 --> 01:03:16,129
<b>I see.</b>

1080
01:03:17,169 --> 01:03:19,540
<b>But even if my life depends on it,</b>

1081
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:22,639
<b>I can't ask Dr. Song to
introduce me to her sister.</b>

1082
01:03:23,270 --> 01:03:26,585
<b>If you arrange a date
as if it's a coincidence,</b>

1083
01:03:26,609 --> 01:03:27,615
<b>I'll do whatever...</b>

1084
01:03:27,639 --> 01:03:28,750
<b>She has a boyfriend.</b>

1085
01:03:29,580 --> 01:03:31,850
<b>What? She does?</b>

1086
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:33,679
<b>Yes.</b>

1087
01:03:34,449 --> 01:03:36,419
<b>It looked like
they're going to marry.</b>

1088
01:03:37,219 --> 01:03:38,990
<b>You got excited over nothing.</b>

1089
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:50,869
<b>Is your car parked at the hospital?</b>

1090
01:03:51,129 --> 01:03:53,840
<b>Yes. I'll call for a driver.
What about you?</b>

1091
01:03:55,570 --> 01:03:58,840
<b>I'll take a taxi from here.
I'd rather not walk back.</b>

1092
01:03:59,109 --> 01:04:00,415
<b>- Okay.
- Bye.</b>

1093
01:04:00,439 --> 01:04:01,550
<b>(Bo Young)</b>

1094
01:04:02,379 --> 01:04:04,879
<b>- I'll call you...
- Where are you?</b>

1095
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:07,796
<b>Si Hoo... My son...</b>

1096
01:04:07,820 --> 01:04:10,689
<b>What's wrong? What's the matter?</b>

1097
01:04:12,659 --> 01:04:16,036
<b>39℃, heart rate 105,
white blood cell count is 18,000.</b>

1098
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:17,835
<b>Respiratory rate is 40,
indicating tachypnea.</b>

1099
01:04:17,859 --> 01:04:19,100
<b>Chemistry results?</b>

1100
01:04:19,830 --> 01:04:21,770
<b>We're still waiting.
I'll get the shot ready.</b>

1101
01:04:22,699 --> 01:04:24,730
<b>Doctor. Si Hoo's okay, isn't he?</b>

1102
01:04:25,139 --> 01:04:26,439
<b>Is he okay?</b>

1103
01:04:26,540 --> 01:04:28,100
<b>Yes. Don't worry.</b>

1104
01:04:28,510 --> 01:04:31,879
<b>It could be pneumonia. I prescribed
an antibiotic, so he'll be fine.</b>

1105
01:04:35,449 --> 01:04:36,510
<b>Bo Young.</b>

1106
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:39,280
<b>Gyu Jin.</b>

1107
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:48,219
<b>It's okay. He'll be fine.</b>

1108
01:05:02,369 --> 01:05:03,369
<b>Thanks.</b>

1109
01:05:05,010 --> 01:05:06,516
<b>- I enjoyed the meal.
- Good.</b>

1110
01:05:06,540 --> 01:05:08,526
<b>- See you tomorrow.
- Bye.</b>

1111
01:05:08,550 --> 01:05:09,580
<b>Bye.</b>

1112
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:14,966
<b>What was that about, Jae Seok?</b>

1113
01:05:14,990 --> 01:05:17,389
<b>She has a boyfriend?
What were you thinking?</b>

1114
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:22,230
<b>Do you...</b>

1115
01:05:28,730 --> 01:05:30,969
<b>Thanks for everything today.</b>

1116
01:05:31,070 --> 01:05:32,915
<b>I feel much better now.</b>

1117
01:05:32,939 --> 01:05:34,399
<b>I enjoyed dinner too.</b>

1118
01:05:34,570 --> 01:05:36,340
<b>Don't skip any meals.</b>

1119
01:05:36,469 --> 01:05:38,480
<b>Find a part-timer soon too.</b>

1120
01:05:38,679 --> 01:05:41,750
<b>Okay, I will. Take care.</b>

1121
01:05:42,449 --> 01:05:43,580
<b>Bye.</b>

1122
01:05:43,709 --> 01:05:45,719
<b>- Sleep well.
- I will.</b>

1123
01:05:45,879 --> 01:05:47,649
<b>Lock up.</b>

1124
01:05:48,490 --> 01:05:49,790
<b>See you.</b>

1125
01:05:51,149 --> 01:05:52,189
<b>Bye.</b>

1126
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:20,419
<b>Yes.</b>

1127
01:06:21,580 --> 01:06:23,050
<b>That's the only answer.</b>

1128
01:06:24,649 --> 01:06:27,820
<b>I like...</b>

1129
01:06:29,429 --> 01:06:30,730
<b>Ms. Song.</b>

1130
01:06:43,169 --> 01:06:46,855
<b>(Epilogue, The day before)</b>

1131
01:06:46,879 --> 01:06:50,850
<b>Let's be honest. I'll say this
only because I have liquid courage.</b>

1132
01:06:51,820 --> 01:06:55,389
<b>Why are parents never okay with
their kids' divorce?</b>

1133
01:06:55,689 --> 01:06:59,036
<b>Look at Americans, for example.</b>

1134
01:06:59,060 --> 01:07:00,635
<b>My life is my own.</b>

1135
01:07:00,659 --> 01:07:02,359
<b>My kids' lives are their own.</b>

1136
01:07:02,459 --> 01:07:04,306
<b>They acknowledge everything.</b>

1137
01:07:04,330 --> 01:07:09,246
<b>Why... Why can't you
let your kids be independent?</b>

1138
01:07:09,270 --> 01:07:10,405
<b>Jeez...</b>

1139
01:07:10,429 --> 01:07:11,770
<b>Yes.</b>

1140
01:07:12,070 --> 01:07:14,300
<b>There's a difference in mentality.</b>

1141
01:07:14,340 --> 01:07:16,010
<b>And culture as well.</b>

1142
01:07:16,169 --> 01:07:19,909
<b>Hey, imagine Ji Hun was divorced.
Would you be cool with that?</b>

1143
01:07:23,050 --> 01:07:24,379
<b>I can't.</b>

1144
01:07:24,609 --> 01:07:27,796
<b>Gosh, no. Never.
This can't happen to Ji Hun.</b>

1145
01:07:27,820 --> 01:07:30,389
<b>- How could you?
- See? You brat.</b>

1146
01:07:30,619 --> 01:07:31,959
<b>Ga Hee!</b>

1147
01:07:32,889 --> 01:07:34,159
<b>Mom!</b>

1148
01:07:34,419 --> 01:07:36,429
<b>My gosh. What's up with her?</b>

1149
01:07:36,590 --> 01:07:38,135
<b>She's drunk.</b>

1150
01:07:38,159 --> 01:07:39,859
<b>Her pupils are dilated.</b>

1151
01:07:40,699 --> 01:07:43,169
<b>Have you ever been to Mount Nam?</b>

1152
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:44,969
<b>Have you?</b>

1153
01:07:45,639 --> 01:07:48,909
<b>Mom. Have you been to Mount Nam?</b>

1154
01:07:49,770 --> 01:07:50,939
<b>I...</b>

1155
01:07:52,679 --> 01:07:54,780
<b>I have been to Mount Nam.</b>

1156
01:08:01,149 --> 01:08:02,695
<b>She's out of it.</b>

1157
01:08:02,719 --> 01:08:04,665
<b>Why did she mention Mount Nam?</b>

1158
01:08:04,689 --> 01:08:06,359
<b>She must've gone.</b>

1159
01:08:08,859 --> 01:08:10,590
<b>Who did she go with?</b>

1160
01:08:13,260 --> 01:08:15,105
<b>No!</b>

1161
01:08:15,129 --> 01:08:18,300
<b>- No, no.
- No, no.</b>

1162

<b>(Once Again)</b>

1163
01:08:42,459 --> 01:08:44,566
<b>I'm not cleaning right now.</b>

01:08:44,590 --> 01:08:46,060
<b>I'm wiping my heart.</b>

1165

<b>I'll go back

1166

<b>I'll go back

01:08:50,270 --> 01:08:51,247
<b>My gosh!</b>

1168
01:08:51,271 --> 01:08:52,415
<b>- Mom.
- What happened to you?</b>

1169
01:08:52,439 --> 01:08:54,345
<b>- Well...
- What did you do to him?</b>

1170
01:08:54,369 --> 01:08:56,209
<b>I'm sorry. I was careless.</b>

1171
01:08:56,510 --> 01:08:58,486
<b>I was so afraid yesterday.</b>

1172
01:08:58,510 --> 01:09:00,016
<b>No, don't say that.</b>

1173
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:01,780
<b>It'll only make me
feel uncomfortable.</b>

1174
01:09:02,280 --> 01:09:05,050
<b>Then I won't do that from now on.</b>

1175
01:09:05,879 --> 01:09:07,425
<b>- Are you...
- Who are you?</b>

1176
01:09:07,449 --> 01:09:09,550
<b>It is you, Young Dal.</b>

1177
01:09:09,790 --> 01:09:12,996
<b>Oh, right. I visited my mom's
a while ago...</b>

1178
01:09:13,020 --> 01:09:15,590
<b>and heard about my cousin
