00:00:08,685 --> 00:00:10,710
<i>Episode 2</i>

2
00:00:21,395 --> 00:00:22,690
You came back...

3
00:00:26,995 --> 00:00:28,190
Bong-Ryun

4
00:00:33,805 --> 00:00:38,200
Do you, still remember me?

5
00:00:38,715 --> 00:00:40,510
How could I forget you?

6
00:00:42,015 --> 00:00:44,014
I've waited 5 years,

7
00:00:44,015 --> 00:00:46,110
upon the hill with
the ribbon tied to the tree.

8
00:00:48,115 --> 00:00:49,480
Is that so...

9
00:00:50,185 --> 00:00:52,090
How have you been?

10
00:00:52,795 --> 00:00:54,490
Why did you suddenly leave?

11
00:00:57,495 --> 00:00:59,390
I will tell you in due time.

12
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:05,530
You...

13
00:01:07,105 --> 00:01:08,800
aren't glad to see me?

14
00:01:27,195 --> 00:01:30,990
Bong-Ryun, Bong-Ryun!

15
00:01:31,295 --> 00:01:35,099
I said,
aren't you glad to see me?

16
00:01:37,105 --> 00:01:38,600
<i>My Princess!</i>

17
00:01:42,005 --> 00:01:44,404
How dare you
put your hands on her!

18
00:01:44,405 --> 00:01:45,710
I should cut your throat!

19
00:01:48,415 --> 00:01:49,940
Princess?

20
00:01:50,785 --> 00:01:51,984
What do you mean by...

21
00:01:51,985 --> 00:01:52,814
Step back!

22
00:01:52,815 --> 00:01:54,810
Dan-Ah, stop!

23
00:01:56,585 --> 00:01:58,520
He is the son of
the Lord of Ganghwa.

24
00:02:03,265 --> 00:02:04,920
Step back and
show your respect!

25
00:02:05,195 --> 00:02:06,760
She is our Princess.

26
00:02:12,104 --> 00:02:15,800
In due time,
I will tell you everything...

27
00:02:16,604 --> 00:02:18,199
Please excuse me.

28
00:02:32,895 --> 00:02:35,364
This marriage is too extravagant
for my son.

29
00:02:35,365 --> 00:02:36,594
<i>Kyung Choi (Ganghwa Governor)</i>

30
00:02:36,595 --> 00:02:38,460
Please, reconsider.

31
00:02:38,795 --> 00:02:42,199
If you're loyal to the crown,
how can you deny the King's orders?

32
00:02:42,905 --> 00:02:48,400
Delay the cargo vessel's departure
and constitute an engagement.

33
00:02:49,505 --> 00:02:52,810
The cargo vessel will be
on schedule.

34
00:02:53,445 --> 00:02:54,810
It will not be delayed.

35
00:02:56,415 --> 00:03:00,710
Okay, as you wish.

36
00:03:09,595 --> 00:03:10,764
<i>A million coins?</i>

37
00:03:10,765 --> 00:03:12,860
<i>How are you so wealthy?</i>

38
00:03:14,195 --> 00:03:17,404
<i>It is our family's fortune
that Kyung Choi seized</i>

39
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:19,500
<i>and hid in the ship.</i>

40
00:03:21,405 --> 00:03:24,504
All this money
you have plundered

41
00:03:24,505 --> 00:03:28,310
and embezzled cost this country
it's economic crisis!

42
00:03:28,715 --> 00:03:31,244
This is quite a feat...

43
00:03:31,245 --> 00:03:32,084
<i>Byung-Hak Kim</i>

44
00:03:32,085 --> 00:03:34,810
The King and Kyung Choi
are already in alliance.

45
00:03:35,225 --> 00:03:37,424
If the cargo vessel reaches
the King,

46
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:38,424
<i>Haoak Jwa-Keun Kim (Prime Minister)</i>

47
00:03:38,425 --> 00:03:41,590
he will annihilate our family.

48
00:03:45,095 --> 00:03:49,200
Our family's future depends on
your mission in Ganghwa.

49
00:03:50,705 --> 00:03:52,200
Do you understand?

50
00:03:53,505 --> 00:03:57,500
Yes, father,
I will delay the ship's departure.

51
00:03:57,905 --> 00:04:01,614
Then, I will extract
all the riches back.

52
00:04:01,615 --> 00:04:05,310
Why don't you just assassinate
Kyung Choi?

53
00:04:06,715 --> 00:04:09,524
If anything happens to him,

54
00:04:09,525 --> 00:04:12,790
the ship will lock down
and set sail right away.

55
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:16,064
It will not stop
at any port and go straight

56
00:04:16,065 --> 00:04:17,690
to the royal guards in Hanyang.

57
00:04:18,095 --> 00:04:21,090
Thus, our family won't be
able to interfere.

58
00:04:22,565 --> 00:04:26,330
Instead, we should let him live
and coerse him.

59
00:04:28,905 --> 00:04:32,340
Kyung Choi has a son yet
to be married?

60
00:04:33,075 --> 00:04:34,110
Yes, father.

61
00:04:35,715 --> 00:04:38,010
Take the princess with you.

62
00:04:38,815 --> 00:04:41,614
Even Kyung Choi cannot deny
a Royal wedding proposal,

63
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,880
he will have to delay
the departure.

64
00:04:45,895 --> 00:04:50,090
His son is decent and useful.

65
00:04:51,395 --> 00:04:53,990
We could make him our follower.

66
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:56,400
Yes, father.

67
00:05:27,065 --> 00:05:29,904
He is Hanyang's best fortuneteller.

68
00:05:29,905 --> 00:05:31,974
<i>Gwansanggam
A royal office dedicated to studying
geography, astronomy, mathâ€¦</i>

69
00:05:31,975 --> 00:05:34,104
He came to see
this land's Feng Shui,

70
00:05:34,105 --> 00:05:36,100
and decided to pay respects to you,
the local governor.

71
00:05:37,305 --> 00:05:40,610
Why don't you tell
these young men their fortune?

72
00:05:41,815 --> 00:05:43,010
Shall I, sir?

73
00:05:51,485 --> 00:05:53,650
You have a good face.

74
00:05:54,495 --> 00:05:56,090
What is your birth date and time?

75
00:05:57,695 --> 00:05:58,790
You mean me?

76
00:06:00,195 --> 00:06:02,704
He has been failing
his test for years.

77
00:06:02,705 --> 00:06:05,300
Will he find
any success this year?

78
00:06:06,905 --> 00:06:12,910
I was born on the year of the Monkey,
on the 18th day of the 6th moon.

79
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:30,390
Like a stone buried in dry desert.

80
00:06:32,095 --> 00:06:34,590
You should not expect greatness,

81
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:40,900
just tag along a worthy friend

82
00:06:41,505 --> 00:06:44,500
and hope for the best.

83
00:06:46,745 --> 00:06:48,410
Is that so?

84
00:06:48,915 --> 00:06:52,710
A worthy friend?
He must mean you Chun-Jung!

85
00:06:56,985 --> 00:06:59,490
Young Lord, how about yours?

86
00:07:00,595 --> 00:07:01,590
I'm okay, thank you.

87
00:07:01,995 --> 00:07:04,090
Born in 1984, on the 28th of May

88
00:07:05,695 --> 00:07:06,790
And the time?

89
00:07:07,535 --> 00:07:08,490
I do not know.

90
00:07:10,405 --> 00:07:13,904
I was dispatched to Gyeongsang
as a temporary governor

91
00:07:13,905 --> 00:07:16,000
and missed his birth.

92
00:07:16,805 --> 00:07:20,710
Hm... without the time of birth,
I cannot read accurately.

93
00:07:50,105 --> 00:07:51,200
He's a dragon.

94
00:07:57,215 --> 00:07:59,510
<i>A black dragon soaring up
from a vast plain.</i>

95
00:08:04,285 --> 00:08:07,990
Your name will be known
across the nation!

96
00:08:09,795 --> 00:08:12,090
With both wisdom and strength,

97
00:08:12,995 --> 00:08:14,860
you are worthy of
becoming a great general.

98
00:08:17,105 --> 00:08:22,100
Huh? Governor Choi's son is
such a noteworthy champion?

99
00:08:22,405 --> 00:08:23,600
That is enough!

100
00:08:23,905 --> 00:08:30,310
Also! Your soul mate is
very near by!

101
00:08:31,515 --> 00:08:34,180
<i>His what? soul mate?</i>

102
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:40,090
<i>She is no ordinary human.</i>

103
00:08:40,995 --> 00:08:44,790
She is of royalty
and greatness.

104
00:08:46,595 --> 00:08:47,530
Host!

105
00:08:51,105 --> 00:08:52,600
Where is the bathroom?

106
00:08:52,605 --> 00:08:54,100
<i>Jungbang (Bathroom)</i>

107
00:08:54,175 --> 00:08:58,700
How can i stand idle as you pour
poison into this young man's ear?

108
00:08:59,615 --> 00:09:02,240
I shall help him wash his ears.

109
00:09:05,815 --> 00:09:08,920
Are you saying
my words are poison?

110
00:09:10,185 --> 00:09:11,480
What is this insolence!

111
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:14,494
Apologies my Lord!

112
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:17,094
There's always some crazy person
trying ruin the day!

113
00:09:17,095 --> 00:09:18,490
It's been a while, Kyung!

114
00:09:25,105 --> 00:09:27,900
Let him go,
he is my old friend.

115
00:09:29,105 --> 00:09:33,810
My friend it's been 10 years,
what an entrance!

116
00:09:35,415 --> 00:09:36,780
He is my oldest friend.

117
00:09:37,145 --> 00:09:40,110
The people know him as
the Monk of nature.

118
00:09:40,715 --> 00:09:42,320
Monk of nature?

119
00:09:48,695 --> 00:09:52,194
This monk predicted the coming of

120
00:09:52,195 --> 00:09:54,794
Emperor Xiangfeng
when he was just a child.

121
00:09:54,795 --> 00:09:56,000
He is a great monk.

122
00:10:00,005 --> 00:10:01,500
Is that actually him?

123
00:10:02,305 --> 00:10:05,400
Could I please join your table?

124
00:10:05,915 --> 00:10:07,110
Sure.

125
00:10:40,315 --> 00:10:44,510
Chun-Jung,
let me cure your ears,

126
00:10:44,915 --> 00:10:45,910
listen carefully.

127
00:10:47,915 --> 00:10:50,680
You are in fact the black dragon.

128
00:10:51,755 --> 00:10:56,360
Dragons have great power
but lack finesse

129
00:10:56,365 --> 00:11:01,390
and soar high but
fall just as hard.

130
00:11:03,005 --> 00:11:07,300
Soon you will experience
great loss and defeat.

131
00:11:08,205 --> 00:11:13,610
Also, you will prove unworthy of
your soul mate's greatness and soon,

132
00:11:13,915 --> 00:11:19,810
will lose her too.

133
00:11:22,225 --> 00:11:23,480
But!

134
00:11:24,785 --> 00:11:26,990
There is one right thing
that man said.

135
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:31,890
Soon, you will have to choose
between two paths.

136
00:11:33,295 --> 00:11:37,300
Are you disguising insults
about my life as a cure?

137
00:11:48,915 --> 00:11:52,410
Please take my cup.
It is my appreciation.

138
00:11:59,795 --> 00:12:03,960
You don't believe his words,
nor mine.

139
00:12:04,195 --> 00:12:06,894
Destiny and my future,

140
00:12:06,895 --> 00:12:08,690
can be told
from multiple narratives.

141
00:12:09,705 --> 00:12:13,004
Fortune telling is like putting
a ring on an ear

142
00:12:13,005 --> 00:12:15,004
and calling it an earring.

143
00:12:15,005 --> 00:12:18,504
you've just taught and
proved it's uselessness.

144
00:12:18,505 --> 00:12:22,514
And anyone who pardons wisdom
on me, even a beggar,

145
00:12:22,515 --> 00:12:23,810
is my teacher.

146
00:12:24,615 --> 00:12:27,110
In your words, I am the beggar?

147
00:12:45,905 --> 00:12:48,204
Why'd you leave so early?

148
00:12:48,205 --> 00:12:50,404
Things were getting interesting.

149
00:12:50,405 --> 00:12:53,010
Father looked furious.

150
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:54,814
He was demanding me
to leave with his eyes.

151
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:59,214
Right... After the monk spoke
he looked distressed.

152
00:12:59,215 --> 00:13:00,510
Young Lord!

153
00:13:01,815 --> 00:13:05,080
A message from the princess.

154
00:13:05,795 --> 00:13:07,890
Pr... Princess? Wait...

155
00:13:14,495 --> 00:13:16,100
Open it sir.

156
00:13:20,605 --> 00:13:23,400
<i>Let us meet... Alone...</i>

157
00:13:52,105 --> 00:13:52,970
Bong-Ryun...

158
00:13:55,105 --> 00:13:58,170
I mean...
Princess, what may I do for you?

159
00:13:59,715 --> 00:14:02,814
We have something to see,
let us go.

160
00:14:02,815 --> 00:14:06,710
Go where?
The night is upon us.

161
00:14:07,515 --> 00:14:08,710
Follow me.

162
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24,900
If I told you why I snooped
around the port at night

163
00:14:26,205 --> 00:14:28,404
and snuck into the boat...

164
00:14:28,405 --> 00:14:30,970
If I told you my reasons
and ask for service,

165
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:33,410
will you help me?

166
00:14:34,175 --> 00:14:35,640
Help?

167
00:14:36,185 --> 00:14:38,110
Are you in trouble?

168
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:19,290
Are you asking me to
believe this?

169
00:15:19,825 --> 00:15:21,690
Please listen to me.

170
00:15:23,195 --> 00:15:25,494
A horrific accident
will happen here,

171
00:15:25,495 --> 00:15:27,290
and I cannot do anything
about it.

172
00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:34,300
The only person I can trust...
is you Young Lord.

173
00:15:34,675 --> 00:15:37,200
Princess, you have
always been different.

174
00:15:38,305 --> 00:15:41,970
I will never take
your word as false.

175
00:15:43,215 --> 00:15:47,110
If so, will you help me?

176
00:15:47,815 --> 00:15:50,220
I will always come to
your rescue.

177
00:15:51,185 --> 00:15:52,890
But you already knew that no?

178
00:15:58,295 --> 00:15:59,730
I have one question though.

179
00:16:01,095 --> 00:16:03,460
What do they earn

180
00:16:04,765 --> 00:16:09,130
from committing such heinous acts?

181
00:16:10,705 --> 00:16:12,000
Truthfully...

182
00:16:14,215 --> 00:16:16,610
<i>I am not certain of their motives,
it could be money, power,</i>

183
00:16:17,615 --> 00:16:19,410
<i>or someone's death...</i>

184
00:16:21,015 --> 00:16:23,120
<i>but I am not sure.</i>

185
00:16:25,895 --> 00:16:27,590
One thing for certain is
they will do anything to succeed.

186
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:32,790
Rather it be sacrificing hundreds
and burning this whole place down,

187
00:16:34,235 --> 00:16:37,199
they will do anything to get
what they want.

188
00:16:40,104 --> 00:16:42,100
Sacrificing hundreds you say...

189
00:16:47,415 --> 00:16:50,510
I will begin searching
and observing Bong-Ryun,

190
00:16:51,815 --> 00:16:53,110
I mean Princess.

191
00:16:55,825 --> 00:16:58,280
Let go of me you bastards!

192
00:17:01,295 --> 00:17:02,390
I said let go!

193
00:17:07,695 --> 00:17:09,700
Young Lord why?

194
00:17:11,005 --> 00:17:12,300
Why are you doing this to me?

195
00:17:12,705 --> 00:17:17,700
Don't expect greatness and
tag along a worthy friend?

196
00:17:19,315 --> 00:17:21,410
These were your words for me?

197
00:17:21,715 --> 00:17:23,010
Huh?

198
00:17:26,315 --> 00:17:29,110
All I do is deliver
what is written.

199
00:17:52,005 --> 00:17:54,510
Now read my true future.

200
00:17:55,015 --> 00:17:58,910
Let me try again...

201
00:17:59,715 --> 00:18:03,480
Try again,
and try harder this time.

202
00:18:12,695 --> 00:18:16,300
Please excuse me first.

203
00:18:22,405 --> 00:18:26,510
Well... your powers my princess.

204
00:18:29,015 --> 00:18:30,910
If you can see someone's death,

205
00:18:32,315 --> 00:18:33,710
can you also see good things?

206
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:38,280
Like someone's greatness...

207
00:18:39,295 --> 00:18:44,190
or who might love and
care for them?

208
00:18:49,195 --> 00:18:50,700
Greatness...

209
00:18:55,105 --> 00:18:58,700
I have seen it once
within one person.

210
00:19:13,425 --> 00:19:15,154
<i>Ja-Young Min (Future Empress Myeongseong)</i>

211
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:16,390
<i>I do not know who she is.</i>

212
00:19:16,495 --> 00:19:18,390
She was merely a child passing by.

213
00:19:18,795 --> 00:19:24,500
What about, someone to care,
and love for?

214
00:19:24,905 --> 00:19:26,000
That...

215
00:19:28,105 --> 00:19:30,300
<i>Those things even
ordinary people can see!</i>

216
00:19:30,905 --> 00:19:33,910
He brightens up
at the sight of you.

217
00:19:34,915 --> 00:19:35,910
Brightens?

218
00:19:40,115 --> 00:19:42,114
My Bong-Ryun
will be married soon!

219
00:19:42,115 --> 00:19:44,580
What do you mean married!

220
00:20:05,745 --> 00:20:08,270
The fireflies came to
greet you as well.

221
00:20:09,615 --> 00:20:12,310
It really must be you,
my Bong-Ryun.

222
00:20:13,215 --> 00:20:16,480
<i>My Bong-Ryun?</i>

223
00:20:34,305 --> 00:20:38,500
I must... leave now.

224
00:20:59,695 --> 00:21:00,930
Cold and darkness...

225
00:21:01,035 --> 00:21:01,930
What?

226
00:21:01,935 --> 00:21:03,404
<i>Suksaljigi (A cold murderous breeze)</i>

227
00:21:03,405 --> 00:21:04,460
Explain yourself.

228
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:09,900
<i>You are like a scary forsaken sword
discarded upon a cliff.</i>

229
00:21:10,605 --> 00:21:12,700
You do not
cherish life thus...

230
00:21:18,215 --> 00:21:20,310
you are fine with murder...

231
00:21:21,015 --> 00:21:22,510
Please be careful.

232
00:21:24,085 --> 00:21:25,680
Murder you say...

233
00:21:26,795 --> 00:21:28,590
You are correct this time.

234
00:21:36,205 --> 00:21:37,300
Young Lord!

235
00:21:43,205 --> 00:21:47,410
I left a letter in your room.

236
00:21:48,615 --> 00:21:51,210
It writes that you are
leaving to Jeolla-do.

237
00:22:18,005 --> 00:22:20,310
Jangdong Kim-Moon' Family
is requesting

238
00:22:20,815 --> 00:22:23,510
your marriage with the princess.

239
00:22:24,815 --> 00:22:29,620
The princess and I?

240
00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:35,090
All of this is
about the cargo vessel.

241
00:22:36,095 --> 00:22:37,890
Nothing much change.

242
00:22:39,095 --> 00:22:42,494
I have requested for you
to stay with the Monk,

243
00:22:42,495 --> 00:22:44,100
go train for a few years.

244
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:50,470
Once the ship sets sail,
horrible events will consume us.

245
00:22:50,605 --> 00:22:52,000
Respectfully, no sir.

246
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:53,814
I shall not leave!

247
00:22:53,815 --> 00:22:57,310
What?
What did you just say?

248
00:22:57,615 --> 00:22:58,614
Young Lord!

249
00:22:58,615 --> 00:23:03,120
Even after winning the state exam
at 17, I stayed by your side.

250
00:23:03,825 --> 00:23:06,184
Yet you tell me to do nothing?

251
00:23:06,185 --> 00:23:08,790
Hide from the world,

252
00:23:09,395 --> 00:23:11,290
and lose the love of my life?

253
00:23:12,225 --> 00:23:13,730
Why must I live like this?

254
00:23:14,035 --> 00:23:15,890
Everything is for your sake.

255
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:17,560
I will not leave.

256
00:23:18,505 --> 00:23:20,430
I have made a promise to
the princess.

257
00:23:21,305 --> 00:23:23,204
And I plan on keeping it.

258
00:23:23,205 --> 00:23:25,370
You have met with her separately?

259
00:23:49,705 --> 00:23:54,900
This is my martial arts technique
Seven Dragons.

260
00:23:56,705 --> 00:23:58,374
You still don't wish to
come with me?

261
00:23:58,375 --> 00:24:02,310
I've lived my whole life
as my father commanded.

262
00:24:03,985 --> 00:24:05,344
I won't have it anymore.

263
00:24:05,345 --> 00:24:07,410
It is quite ironic because,

264
00:24:10,985 --> 00:24:12,980
your father has suffered
just like you.

265
00:24:14,195 --> 00:24:18,590
He couldn't accept your fate of dying
at a young age!

266
00:24:19,995 --> 00:24:23,400
Your soul mate will betray you,

267
00:24:26,905 --> 00:24:28,400
and you will die young.

268
00:24:29,105 --> 00:24:33,414
But if you quit everything
and come with me

269
00:24:33,415 --> 00:24:34,714
you and your father will live.

270
00:24:34,715 --> 00:24:36,610
Your words are inconsistent.

271
00:24:37,545 --> 00:24:41,910
How can someone betray me
and be my soul mate?

272
00:24:42,415 --> 00:24:46,320
Leaving with
you can change my destiny?

273
00:24:46,925 --> 00:24:50,690
Then there is nothing
to be afraid of.

274
00:24:51,395 --> 00:24:52,960
I can just change my future.

275
00:24:54,695 --> 00:24:57,500
Sure.
Go fight against your destiny.

276
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:00,700
That is in fact, your destiny.

277
00:25:14,915 --> 00:25:17,480
What are you doing?

278
00:25:18,985 --> 00:25:21,290
Write the royal order.

279
00:25:30,965 --> 00:25:33,730
<i>Cheoljong
25th King of the Joseon Dynasty</i>

280
00:25:43,545 --> 00:25:47,710
Governor of Ganghwa, Kyung Choi,
accept your Royal command.

281
00:25:49,055 --> 00:25:52,884
The Royal Family approves
and congratulates

282
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:56,124
the wedding of Kyung Choi's son
Chun-Jung Choi

283
00:25:56,125 --> 00:25:58,490
and his Majesty's daughter
Hwa-Ryun.

284
00:25:58,995 --> 00:26:04,004
Kyung Choi must proceed with
the upmost respect,

285
00:26:04,005 --> 00:26:06,204
not make any complications,
and report back accordingly.

286
00:26:06,205 --> 00:26:10,200
Governor of Ganghwa, Kyung Choi,
accept the royal command!

287
00:26:23,925 --> 00:26:25,184
Congratulations!

288
00:26:25,185 --> 00:26:28,090
You are now the King's son in law.

289
00:26:28,855 --> 00:26:29,820
Sir.

290
00:26:32,565 --> 00:26:35,564
The wedding must proceed
without any complications,

291
00:26:35,565 --> 00:26:38,104
why don't you delay
the cargo ship's departure?

292
00:26:38,105 --> 00:26:39,060
Do you understand?

293
00:26:48,515 --> 00:26:50,384
Pardon me but,
my father is the leader of this area,

294
00:26:50,385 --> 00:26:52,414
<i>Gwanjin
Main Border Port</i>

295
00:26:52,415 --> 00:26:55,210
he knows what's best.

296
00:26:57,125 --> 00:26:58,120
What?

297
00:27:05,095 --> 00:27:06,590
I will delay...

298
00:27:09,295 --> 00:27:10,700
the ship's departure.

299
00:27:11,935 --> 00:27:14,000
Yes, exactly!

300
00:27:34,595 --> 00:27:36,390
<i>Congratulations Princess!</i>

301
00:27:39,395 --> 00:27:40,690
Thank you

302
00:27:41,195 --> 00:27:42,494
Is that all?

303
00:27:42,495 --> 00:27:44,934
You will be a dear wife now!

304
00:27:44,935 --> 00:27:46,300
Are you not excited?

305
00:27:49,405 --> 00:27:52,700
Mother would have been happy.

306
00:27:55,115 --> 00:27:56,610
Look over here Dan-Ah.

307
00:27:57,215 --> 00:28:00,680
6 years have passed since I left,
but it is exactly the same.

308
00:28:01,415 --> 00:28:03,824
Miss, we should leave now.

309
00:28:03,825 --> 00:28:07,294
The court ladies have gathered
to congratulate you.

310
00:28:07,295 --> 00:28:08,790
Okay.

311
00:28:14,995 --> 00:28:19,104
<i>Could I truly rid myself of them?</i>

312
00:28:19,105 --> 00:28:20,500
<i>Miss!</i>

313
00:28:26,245 --> 00:28:28,240
<i>Attention!</i>

314
00:28:28,545 --> 00:28:30,114
Group 1 border the port,

315
00:28:30,115 --> 00:28:31,744
Group 2 guard
the main road entrance!

316
00:28:31,745 --> 00:28:32,584
Yes, sir!

317
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:34,184
Although the departure
has been delayed,

318
00:28:34,185 --> 00:28:36,920
we must protect the ship
at all costs.

319
00:28:36,955 --> 00:28:40,594
This is a strict order from the governor,
maintain high alert!

320
00:28:40,595 --> 00:28:41,720
Yes, sir!

321
00:29:04,045 --> 00:29:06,554
What do you mean
you can't intrude the ship!

322
00:29:06,555 --> 00:29:10,120
My apologies.
The perimeters have been reinforced.

323
00:29:10,285 --> 00:29:13,494
You're saying you
cannot retrieve the cargo?

324
00:29:13,495 --> 00:29:14,790
No, sir!

325
00:29:15,055 --> 00:29:17,690
I will bring it back,
no matter what!

326
00:29:17,895 --> 00:29:19,190
How?

327
00:29:21,295 --> 00:29:22,590
You idiot...

328
00:29:23,705 --> 00:29:25,500
You leave me no choice.

329
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:29,700
I shall kill the dog
that bites the feeding hand.

330
00:29:33,315 --> 00:29:35,910
Move the hidden gun powder
to the port.

331
00:29:36,615 --> 00:29:40,510
Enter the ship during
the chaotic aftermath of the explosion.

332
00:29:41,315 --> 00:29:42,410
Yes sir!

333
00:30:46,615 --> 00:30:48,810
<i>A message from the princess!</i>

334
00:31:01,195 --> 00:31:02,490
My Lord.

335
00:31:03,665 --> 00:31:04,930
<i>Room 2-1</i>

336
00:31:06,605 --> 00:31:09,704
How dare you share
the gwana's key to a stranger...

337
00:31:09,705 --> 00:31:11,100
You have committed
a major crime!

338
00:31:13,545 --> 00:31:16,214
Sorry, my Lord!

339
00:31:16,215 --> 00:31:18,814
I thought he was a soldier
from the gwana...

340
00:31:18,815 --> 00:31:20,814
You brat!
You call that an excuse?

341
00:31:20,815 --> 00:31:22,814
He paid me a small fortune

342
00:31:22,815 --> 00:31:24,524
so I borrowed the key
from the officer's station.

343
00:31:24,525 --> 00:31:25,924
<i>Jilchung
Resting place for officials</i>

344
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:27,150
I got it back quickly, I swear!

345
00:31:34,195 --> 00:31:36,190
<i>I have found
what you were looking for.</i>

346
00:31:37,005 --> 00:31:38,400
<i>Come to the port.</i>

347
00:31:46,205 --> 00:31:47,610
<i>My Lord!</i>

348
00:31:50,715 --> 00:31:53,410
My Lord you cannot.

349
00:31:59,385 --> 00:32:02,690
I am fully aware you secretly
met Chun-Jung Choi.

350
00:32:03,795 --> 00:32:07,790
Seducing him
for my family is good,

351
00:32:08,195 --> 00:32:10,800
but if you become a threat
to my family...

352
00:32:13,105 --> 00:32:16,970
You will suffer
another great punishment!

353
00:33:06,085 --> 00:33:09,194
My Lord this is... gun powder!

354
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:10,090
Retreat!

355
00:33:10,895 --> 00:33:12,790
Retreat!
This is gun powder!

356
00:33:30,815 --> 00:33:33,114
<i>This is a piece of oil paper,</i>

357
00:33:33,115 --> 00:33:35,710
<i>unrecognizable sigil
because of the tear</i>

358
00:34:02,715 --> 00:34:04,310
Get him!

359
00:34:30,475 --> 00:34:31,600
Surround him!

360
00:34:40,815 --> 00:34:42,110
Who sent you!

361
00:35:25,595 --> 00:35:28,290
<i>Congratulations on
the young Lord's marriage my Lord.</i>

362
00:35:28,435 --> 00:35:32,300
I am more pleased
about this ship's departure.

363
00:35:33,505 --> 00:35:36,804
It must arrive at Hanyang
without failure!

364
00:35:36,805 --> 00:35:37,800
Yes, sir!

365
00:35:56,895 --> 00:35:59,790
My Lord, you look too happy!

366
00:36:02,595 --> 00:36:04,600
<i>So Handsome!</i>

367
00:36:42,905 --> 00:36:44,700
<i>Bong-Ryun...</i>

368
00:36:45,705 --> 00:36:49,710
<i>the King's daughter... a princess?</i>

369
00:36:50,515 --> 00:36:52,310
Bow!

370
00:37:53,615 --> 00:37:56,840
<i>My Lord Governor! My Lord!</i>

371
00:37:57,945 --> 00:38:02,150
The ship...
the cargo vessel has exploded!

372
00:38:05,355 --> 00:38:08,354
Gather all the troops guarding
the wedding!

373
00:38:08,355 --> 00:38:11,060
- Off to the port!
- Yes, Lord!

374
00:38:33,815 --> 00:38:36,854
<i>Young Lord!
You must finish your wedding!</i>

375
00:38:36,855 --> 00:38:38,250
Young Lord!

376
00:38:40,655 --> 00:38:43,290
<i>My God, what do we do?
What now!</i>

377
00:38:44,365 --> 00:38:45,860
<i>It's a fire! A fire!</i>

378
00:38:46,135 --> 00:38:48,930
<i>This was my dream...</i>

379
00:38:49,065 --> 00:38:51,160
<i>He is the one responsible!</i>

380
00:38:53,335 --> 00:38:56,040
<i>What is all of this...</i>

381
00:39:05,955 --> 00:39:07,750
<i>My goodness...</i>

382
00:39:12,925 --> 00:39:14,350
<i>They're all dying!</i>

383
00:39:45,355 --> 00:39:49,160
Oh, my! Oh, my!
How much is this worth my Lord!

384
00:39:53,365 --> 00:39:56,004
My son has done a great job.

385
00:39:56,005 --> 00:40:01,030
Now what will you do with
Ganghwa's governor Kyung Choi?

386
00:40:18,955 --> 00:40:25,360
Higher ups promoted me to Commanding
Governor to handle this situation!

387
00:40:27,365 --> 00:40:32,570
Arrest Kyung Choi for hiding explosives
in the ship headed to Hanyang!

388
00:40:33,535 --> 00:40:36,340
He will suffer for conspiring
against the crown!

389
00:40:36,545 --> 00:40:37,540
Yes, sir!

390
00:40:38,245 --> 00:40:40,240
Conspire?

391
00:40:40,445 --> 00:40:41,940
What do you mean?

392
00:40:42,845 --> 00:40:44,140
Chun-Jung...

393
00:40:53,755 --> 00:40:54,650
Father!

394
00:40:59,965 --> 00:41:02,060
- Arrest him!
- Yes, sir!

395
00:41:03,165 --> 00:41:05,264
My Lord! My Lord!

396
00:41:05,265 --> 00:41:06,370
Father!

397
00:41:06,535 --> 00:41:07,730
My Lord!

398
00:41:15,445 --> 00:41:19,250
What?
Do you have something to say?

399
00:41:21,555 --> 00:41:22,850
<i>Gun powder?</i>

400
00:41:24,355 --> 00:41:29,260
You found this in your ports
and say it is of our family?

401
00:41:29,965 --> 00:41:32,264
The culprit killed himself.

402
00:41:32,265 --> 00:41:38,260
But, we have heard that
he was a soldier under your command!

403
00:41:42,235 --> 00:41:45,140
Do you have any proof of
your claims?

404
00:41:45,445 --> 00:41:49,940
It seems more likely
it was your father's gun powder...

405
00:41:51,545 --> 00:41:56,754
You and your father's dark plan
to conspire against the crown.

406
00:41:56,755 --> 00:41:58,450
Don't you agree?

407
00:41:59,655 --> 00:42:01,750
This was your plan all along right?

408
00:42:02,355 --> 00:42:05,160
You lead me to the gun powder
in the storage area on purpose!

409
00:42:05,465 --> 00:42:06,660
Am I right?

410
00:42:11,065 --> 00:42:15,430
Escort prisoner Chun-Jung Choi
to his cell and make sure he behaves.

411
00:42:15,635 --> 00:42:16,840
Yes, sir!

412
00:42:50,045 --> 00:42:54,340
My father's sword worth more than
1,000 golds from the Qing Dynasty.

413
00:42:56,545 --> 00:42:58,444
A fine sword...

414
00:42:58,445 --> 00:43:00,650
but I have so many of them.

415
00:43:01,555 --> 00:43:04,320
This is nothing special,
take it and leave.

416
00:43:07,455 --> 00:43:12,160
The higher ups have sent a judge to
investigate the ship's explosion.

417
00:43:12,565 --> 00:43:16,860
The judge is said to be close
with the King and Kyung Choi.

418
00:43:18,465 --> 00:43:20,830
If you stand idle,
you will be found guilty.

419
00:43:21,835 --> 00:43:23,644
As long as Kyung Choi lives,

420
00:43:23,645 --> 00:43:28,140
he will find a way to tie you
to the crimes committed.

421
00:43:29,745 --> 00:43:30,940
And?

422
00:43:31,745 --> 00:43:35,850
I shall dirty my own hands to
put your mind at ease.

423
00:43:36,955 --> 00:43:39,150
When you buy livestock,

424
00:43:39,455 --> 00:43:44,420
do you purchase from
a peddler unbeknownst to you?

425
00:43:58,445 --> 00:44:03,540
Reaching out to you,
my life is already in your hands.

426
00:44:04,445 --> 00:44:08,650
If you find me to be useless,
I shall cut my throat here.

427
00:44:12,655 --> 00:44:14,050
Amusing!

428
00:44:14,855 --> 00:44:20,230
Let's see how useful
my new livestock proves to be!

429
00:44:22,265 --> 00:44:23,260
My Lord!

430
00:44:57,565 --> 00:44:59,974
<i>We shall see...</i>

431
00:44:59,975 --> 00:45:04,940
<i>Come here, hurry!</i>

432
00:45:07,515 --> 00:45:12,754
The Minister of finance sends gifts
for all your hard work!

433
00:45:12,755 --> 00:45:14,950
So heavy, here!

434
00:45:15,255 --> 00:45:16,950
Go have some drinks!

435
00:45:18,455 --> 00:45:19,850
Good night!

436
00:45:34,735 --> 00:45:36,340
Long days working, huh!

437
00:45:39,345 --> 00:45:41,440
My God, this is great!

438
00:45:41,945 --> 00:45:43,340
What are you doing?

439
00:45:44,545 --> 00:45:47,310
Lord Minister of Finance sends
his gifts for our hard work...

440
00:45:54,955 --> 00:45:56,360
What, how is this possible?

441
00:45:57,665 --> 00:45:58,860
Where did they go?

442
00:46:03,465 --> 00:46:05,560
Where is prisoner Chun-Jung Choi?

443
00:46:06,435 --> 00:46:08,030
Shouldn't he be right here?

444
00:46:08,435 --> 00:46:11,840
That is...
he was here just a moment ago...

445
00:46:12,745 --> 00:46:14,240
You let him loose?

446
00:46:16,845 --> 00:46:18,214
No, sir!

447
00:46:18,215 --> 00:46:21,250
I didn't. I swear!

448
00:46:30,965 --> 00:46:32,260
Why are you standing around?

449
00:46:33,565 --> 00:46:36,264
Find the people responsible
and Chun-Jung Choi!

450
00:46:36,265 --> 00:46:37,660
Yes, sir!

451
00:46:38,065 --> 00:46:41,900
- The prisoner has escaped!
- Find him!

452
00:47:04,165 --> 00:47:05,060
Bong-Ryun...

453
00:47:05,465 --> 00:47:07,260
Are you hurt?

454
00:47:07,265 --> 00:47:09,760
I will watch the perimeters.

455
00:47:14,535 --> 00:47:16,030
I have something to tell you.

456
00:47:16,845 --> 00:47:19,744
A judge,
sharing your father's theories,

457
00:47:19,745 --> 00:47:21,844
has been appointed and
is on his way.

458
00:47:21,845 --> 00:47:26,514
Once he arrives, a fair investigation
will reveal the truth.

459
00:47:26,515 --> 00:47:30,350
How? We have no evidence.

460
00:47:32,355 --> 00:47:33,650
You have a witness.

461
00:47:34,295 --> 00:47:35,250
Who?

462
00:47:38,065 --> 00:47:39,160
I am the witness.

463
00:47:41,165 --> 00:47:43,360
I saw everything unfold haven't I?

464
00:47:44,365 --> 00:47:48,670
Byung-Woon Kim will
come after you.

465
00:47:51,945 --> 00:47:53,440
I don't care.

466
00:48:01,055 --> 00:48:06,450
For once,
I am glad to be a princess.

467
00:48:21,035 --> 00:48:22,230
Thank you. Bong-Ryun

468
00:48:25,145 --> 00:48:26,570
I won't ever,

469
00:48:29,445 --> 00:48:30,740
forget your kindness.

470
00:48:56,705 --> 00:48:59,770
<i>Lord Heungseon-gun, Ha-Eung Lee
Chamhaekgwan</i>

471
00:49:14,355 --> 00:49:18,460
Greetings, I did not realize you
would be our appointed judge.

472
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:22,260
Just following the King's orders.

473
00:49:22,665 --> 00:49:25,964
He has asked to proceed
with integrity.

474
00:49:25,965 --> 00:49:28,800
Yes, of course!

475
00:49:29,535 --> 00:49:30,740
Please.

476
00:49:59,675 --> 00:50:03,030
If Jangdong Kim-Moon Family sends
Byung-Woon Kim,

477
00:50:03,545 --> 00:50:09,640
it is to retrieve their ill gotten money
from the cargo ship.

478
00:50:10,545 --> 00:50:14,350
Will you be safe?

479
00:50:14,755 --> 00:50:17,850
My Lord, I will not disappoint.

480
00:50:19,955 --> 00:50:26,060
If anything happens to me,
please take over...

481
00:50:30,565 --> 00:50:33,270
I swear with my life
to protect the King

482
00:50:35,435 --> 00:50:37,140
and bring them to justice.

483
00:50:53,455 --> 00:50:57,560
Princess, why have you requested
to see me?

484
00:50:58,565 --> 00:50:59,860
That is...

485
00:51:01,365 --> 00:51:02,660
Please speak freely.

486
00:51:09,335 --> 00:51:10,240
The truth is...

487
00:51:15,545 --> 00:51:16,840
Who are you?

488
00:51:27,355 --> 00:51:30,860
I am simply here to provide
the judge with the truth.

489
00:51:31,165 --> 00:51:33,660
Do not make me cut you down.

490
00:51:34,865 --> 00:51:36,360
As you please.

491
00:51:40,535 --> 00:51:42,400
I am son of the Governor Kyung Choi,
Chun-Jung Choi.

492
00:51:43,945 --> 00:51:45,240
Please, excuse my manners.

493
00:51:46,715 --> 00:51:47,740
Put down your weapons.

494
00:51:51,845 --> 00:51:53,150
Explain yourself.

495
00:51:53,755 --> 00:51:57,150
Why was there gun powder
on the cargo vessel?

496
00:51:59,555 --> 00:52:02,350
At first we discovered
hidden gun powder in the port.

497
00:52:02,855 --> 00:52:07,434
Byung-Woon Kim's men attempted
to ignite it

498
00:52:07,435 --> 00:52:08,960
but I was able to stop them.

499
00:52:09,565 --> 00:52:14,904
But we did not realize Lord Kim had

500
00:52:14,905 --> 00:52:17,440
also hidden gun powder in the ship.

501
00:52:17,945 --> 00:52:20,474
I have an eye witness,

502
00:52:20,475 --> 00:52:25,640
the princess who has helped me so far.

503
00:52:28,855 --> 00:52:30,050
Is this true?

504
00:52:32,155 --> 00:52:37,360
As princess, can you vouch for
what he is saying?

505
00:52:56,145 --> 00:52:57,210
No.

506
00:53:01,685 --> 00:53:04,250
I do not know
what he is talking about.

507
00:53:06,155 --> 00:53:11,360
I witnessed Kyung Choi and his men
move gun powder onto the ship.

508
00:53:22,135 --> 00:53:25,340
What are you waiting for?
Seize the criminal!

509
00:53:25,545 --> 00:53:26,740
Yes, sir!

510
00:53:32,045 --> 00:53:33,550
Bong-Ryun...

511
00:53:34,255 --> 00:53:35,110
Bong-Ryun!

512
00:53:36,455 --> 00:53:37,654
<i>Bong-Ryun!</i>

513
00:53:37,655 --> 00:53:38,954
<i>Grab him!</i>

514
00:53:38,955 --> 00:53:40,650
Bong-Ryun!

515
00:54:59,005 --> 00:55:02,734
You have embezzled our people

516
00:55:02,735 --> 00:55:05,274
and profited more than
200 times over!

517
00:55:05,275 --> 00:55:09,040
Through the people's blood and sweat
you bought your way to noble status

518
00:55:10,215 --> 00:55:11,614
Now tell me,

519
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:16,010
are you Ganghwa's rich noble man
or a conniving thief!

520
00:55:16,625 --> 00:55:21,250
Please forgive me!
I have committed a heinous act!

521
00:55:21,425 --> 00:55:24,020
I have committed a heinous act.

522
00:55:24,525 --> 00:55:29,160
Your whole family is nothing
but silk wearing thieves!

523
00:55:30,705 --> 00:55:33,374
<i>Search Jinsa Chae's house and</i>

524
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:36,644
<i>recover all that has been stolen!</i>

525
00:55:36,645 --> 00:55:37,700
Yes, sir!

526
00:55:38,805 --> 00:55:42,870
Please let me live.
Please let me live!

527
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:45,910
<i>Please let me live!</i>

528
00:56:06,505 --> 00:56:09,074
Our Lord is innocent!

529
00:56:09,075 --> 00:56:13,174
If we let them take him
to Hanyang, they will cut his throat!

530
00:56:13,175 --> 00:56:15,374
We have to rescue our Lord!

531
00:56:15,375 --> 00:56:17,280
Rescue him!

532
00:56:21,685 --> 00:56:23,780
Move! Back off!

533
00:56:47,475 --> 00:56:48,470
Father!

534
00:56:57,085 --> 00:56:58,280
Let us go!

535
00:57:04,795 --> 00:57:06,994
Father, are you alright?

536
00:57:06,995 --> 00:57:10,504
My son? Are you alright?
Did they hurt you?

537
00:57:10,505 --> 00:57:14,004
It is dangerous here,
follow me!

538
00:57:14,005 --> 00:57:14,974
No my son!

539
00:57:14,975 --> 00:57:17,470
If we leave, we become
the criminals they claim we are!

540
00:57:17,875 --> 00:57:20,774
Chun-Jung, remember my words!

541
00:57:20,775 --> 00:57:24,084
Do not avenge me!

542
00:57:24,085 --> 00:57:27,084
Lower your head and
live in secrecy.

543
00:57:27,085 --> 00:57:29,580
You must keep your life!

544
00:57:30,385 --> 00:57:31,680
Father!

545
00:57:35,495 --> 00:57:39,790
I just wanted to keep you safe.

546
00:57:41,695 --> 00:57:43,600
Father! Father!

547
00:57:46,505 --> 00:57:47,370
In-Gyu!

548
00:57:59,985 --> 00:58:03,580
Father!

549
00:58:03,985 --> 00:58:05,280
Father!

550
00:58:06,995 --> 00:58:09,890
Father!

551
00:58:12,895 --> 00:58:14,390
Father!

552
00:58:20,405 --> 00:58:23,374
Chun-Jung... you mustn't!

553
00:58:23,375 --> 00:58:24,974
Father... hold on...

554
00:58:24,975 --> 00:58:26,970
Chun-Jung!

555
00:58:27,975 --> 00:58:29,440
My Son...

556
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:36,080
Forgive me...

557
00:58:45,495 --> 00:58:47,490
Father! Father!

558
00:58:49,295 --> 00:58:50,900
Father!

559
00:58:53,505 --> 00:58:54,770
Father!

560
00:58:56,475 --> 00:58:58,070
Father!

561
00:59:16,995 --> 00:59:18,590
Father!

562
00:59:56,805 --> 00:59:59,700
He is the Minister of Finance!

563
01:00:02,075 --> 01:00:04,370
Bow down!

564
01:00:22,955 --> 01:00:25,990
<i>Do you recognize this head piece?</i>

565
01:00:29,295 --> 01:00:31,000
What does this mean?

566
01:00:33,505 --> 01:00:35,304
What have you done
to my mother!

567
01:00:35,305 --> 01:00:37,070
Where is my mother!

568
01:00:42,275 --> 01:00:47,484
If you are worried,
you should watch your mouth.

569
01:00:47,485 --> 01:00:50,080
Am I to be scared of
such a threat?

570
01:00:55,195 --> 01:00:58,190
Why don't you test me.

571
01:00:58,995 --> 01:01:03,260
Save Chun-Jung Choi and
see your mother's corpse.

572
01:01:03,805 --> 01:01:05,400
How dare you...

573
01:01:06,405 --> 01:01:08,300
my mother's...

574
01:01:09,875 --> 01:01:11,140
How dare you!

575
01:01:15,475 --> 01:01:17,180
Promise me!

576
01:01:19,885 --> 01:01:25,780
Promise that you will
not kill him!

577
01:01:25,885 --> 01:01:30,090
Spare your mother,
spare Chun-Jung...

578
01:01:30,795 --> 01:01:32,590
If you wish for such,

579
01:01:36,095 --> 01:01:39,600
why don't you get down
and beg me?

580
01:01:48,645 --> 01:01:52,780
Please, sir. I will as I am told,

581
01:01:54,555 --> 01:01:56,580
spare Chun-Jung's life.

582
01:02:00,695 --> 01:02:01,894
Fine.

583
01:02:01,895 --> 01:02:07,094
But once we return to Hanyang,

584
01:02:07,095 --> 01:02:11,100
you must prove
your gratitude to me.

585
01:03:17,705 --> 01:03:20,700
How was your fight
against destiny?

586
01:03:36,185 --> 01:03:37,780
What are you doing?

587
01:03:38,285 --> 01:03:39,680
Let go!

588
01:03:41,995 --> 01:03:43,590
What is all this!

589
01:03:43,995 --> 01:03:47,790
I have spared Chun-Jung
as you requested.

590
01:03:48,895 --> 01:03:54,400
In return you must prove
you are our family's property.

591
01:04:02,975 --> 01:04:05,780
No... Stop!

592
01:04:05,885 --> 01:04:09,880
Let go! Let go! Stop!

593
01:04:23,395 --> 01:04:27,100
If you ever betray our family
or try to run from us,

594
01:04:27,705 --> 01:04:32,670
your mother and Chun-Jung
will be slaughtered!

595
01:06:05,365 --> 01:06:08,300
<i>Baeogae Street, Hanyang</i>

596
01:06:57,285 --> 01:07:00,484
If you profit in our neighborhood
you must pay tax to us!

597
01:07:00,485 --> 01:07:01,694
Profit?

598
01:07:01,695 --> 01:07:05,790
I merely sold smokes and some rice wine,
what do you mean profit!

599
01:07:12,705 --> 01:07:14,500
Ouch, my nose!

600
01:07:15,675 --> 01:07:17,270
<i>What are you idiots doing?</i>

601
01:07:19,675 --> 01:07:22,370
Are you Jangdong Kim-Moon'
underlings?

602
01:07:28,885 --> 01:07:31,680
What is it to you, dirty beggar?

603
01:07:33,585 --> 01:07:34,450
Huh?
