00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,070
(Episode 15)

2
00:00:25,319 --> 00:00:27,490
Why did you send me to Lee Si Joon?

3
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,530
I asked you countless times...

4
00:00:34,229 --> 00:00:35,760
to tell me the name of my condition.

5
00:00:36,129 --> 00:00:37,430
But you never told me.

6
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:38,869
You frequently have conflicts with the people around you...

7
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:41,040
because you have trouble controlling your emotions.

8
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:42,799
And you keep having the same dream...

9
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:44,169
which are all symptoms of anxiety disorder.

10
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:46,640
Just tell me the name of my illness!

11
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,349
When a patient has a personality disorder,

12
00:00:50,349 --> 00:00:52,250
we normally don't tell them the name of the illness.

13
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:54,780
Not only is it difficult to determine the illness,

14
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,349
but it's also bad for their treatment...

15
00:00:56,349 --> 00:00:58,019
when patients are given the wrong information.

16
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:03,629
I personally don't think you have any problems living your daily life.

17
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:05,959
I know you often get angry...

18
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:07,159
and have a wide range of emotions,

19
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:08,730
and that may cause difficulties with your personal relationships.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,399
But everyone lacks something and feels anxious sometimes.

21
00:01:11,399 --> 00:01:13,500
If you know me so well,

22
00:01:13,769 --> 00:01:15,670
why did you send me to another doctor?

23
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:20,509
That's because Dr. Lee is a better doctor than I am.

24
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:26,110
I see. Then I guess you're a bad doctor.

25
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,379
Why did you always pretend like you didn't know anything...

26
00:01:29,379 --> 00:01:30,590
every time I mentioned Dr. Lee?

27
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:33,159
You practically made a fool out of me.

28
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:35,759
- Woo Joo. - You abandoned me!

29
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,289
Why are you angry?

30
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:41,799
Is it because I didn't tell you the name of your illness?

31
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:44,500
I just gave you an answer to that.

32
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,769
Then is it because I introduced you to Dr. Lee? Well, that's not true.

33
00:01:47,769 --> 00:01:50,239
You two had already met before I even introduced you guys.

34
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:53,909
I only asked him to cooperate after I found out about that.

35
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:55,909
The reason I'm angry...

36
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,649
is because you abandoned me!

37
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,590
But it doesn't matter.

38
00:02:04,789 --> 00:02:06,759
I'm used to getting abandoned.

39
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:13,800
You're just the same as my birth and adoptive moms who abandoned me.

40
00:02:15,729 --> 00:02:17,970
I thought you'd be different.

41
00:02:19,169 --> 00:02:20,300
Because you're a doctor.

42
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:23,440
I won't come here again.

43
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:54,000
Then the reason Lee Si Joon was nice to me...

44
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:56,169
was purely because I was his patient?

45
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,039
Woo Joo!

46
00:03:00,109 --> 00:03:01,139
Woo Joo!

47
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,280
Woo Joo!

48
00:03:05,449 --> 00:03:06,750
Woo Joo!

49
00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:10,349
Han Woo Joo!

50
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,120
No. I saw it.

51
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:16,159
What I saw was real.

52
00:03:17,729 --> 00:03:19,229
He was really worried about me.

53
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:24,300
Woo Joo's furious.

54
00:03:24,729 --> 00:03:26,370
She thinks I abandoned her.

55
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,599
Don't worry too much.

56
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,270
Si Joon, what worries me is...

57
00:03:30,609 --> 00:03:32,770
she might be fixated on you...

58
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:36,609
even more out of her anger for me.

59
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:40,479
This is transference.

60
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,220
What should we do?

61
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,829
You figured out the cause of Assemblyman Ko's tic?

62
00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:02,000
Yes. I figured it out by chance when I visited the subway conductors...

63
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,270
to ask about their panic disorders.

64
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,940
Good job. You did great.

65
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:07,909
The director was very pleased.

66
00:04:08,379 --> 00:04:10,079
You put him on medication.

67
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:11,079
Me?

68
00:04:11,409 --> 00:04:14,849
Of course. You figured out the cause.

69
00:04:15,349 --> 00:04:17,089
I'll deal with the rest.

70
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,719
I'm late, aren't I?

71
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,190
No, it's fine.

72
00:04:22,389 --> 00:04:23,990
I just came over after waiting a bit.

73
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,430
Come inside.

74
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:28,199
Do we have to talk in your office?

75
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,469
We don't have to.

76
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,500
Shall we go for a walk?

77
00:04:32,969 --> 00:04:34,240
I'll decide where we'll go.

78
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:40,639
Who was that?

79
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,680
A musical actor who helps with stage therapy.

80
00:04:42,709 --> 00:04:44,310
Oh, her?

81
00:04:45,209 --> 00:04:46,350
What's their relationship?

82
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,149
There is no relationship.

83
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,219
They're walking arm-in-arm and it's nothing?

84
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,589
Ms. Han is Dr. Lee's patient too.

85
00:04:55,589 --> 00:04:57,629
His patient? What does she have?

86
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:01,500
I don't know.

87
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:03,399
Then what?

88
00:05:03,969 --> 00:05:07,100
Si Joon gave his patient a part-time job?

89
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:10,000
I think she became a patient after starting her job.

90
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:19,550
Each time someone abandoned me,

91
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:22,949
I thought it only natural.

92
00:05:23,219 --> 00:05:25,089
Because my birth mom abandoned me.

93
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,990
But then you said that...

94
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,160
I'm not someone who deserves to have...

95
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,430
a boyfriend who cheats on me.

96
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,699
You said that I changed other people's lives.

97
00:05:41,069 --> 00:05:42,139
I think...

98
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:46,410
it's fate that we met.

99
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,009
What do you think?

100
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:54,350
I'm not sure.

101
00:05:56,949 --> 00:05:58,819
Rather than say it's fate,

102
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,959
I think there's a reason we met.

103
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:05,490
- A reason? - Like...

104
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:09,629
Everything that happens to me,

105
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:12,300
whether it's good or bad,

106
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,269
happens for a reason. That's how I see it.

107
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,709
I met you...

108
00:06:17,709 --> 00:06:20,240
for a certain reason. That's what I think.

109
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,440
That is fate.

110
00:06:25,709 --> 00:06:29,449
I think it's slightly different from fate.

111
00:06:29,449 --> 00:06:32,719
No. This is fate. It has to be fate.

112
00:06:32,949 --> 00:06:35,690
If it's not, all the comfort you gave me is a lie.

113
00:06:40,029 --> 00:06:42,230
- Woo Joo. - I have to go.

114
00:06:42,459 --> 00:06:45,329
You're leaving? I barely even started.

115
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:47,000
There's always tomorrow.

116
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:54,879
Oh, dear. She just dropped a bomb.

117
00:06:57,379 --> 00:06:58,480
"Fate"?

118
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,250
He must've been flustered.

119
00:07:03,379 --> 00:07:05,350
- Why? - I told you.

120
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:08,089
If you mention fate when he thinks you're just a patient,

121
00:07:08,089 --> 00:07:10,660
wouldn't that make him feel uncomfortable?

122
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:13,329
That's what I thought at first.

123
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,459
I denied what I felt too.

124
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,329
I'm bad at controlling my emotions,

125
00:07:18,529 --> 00:07:20,769
so I thought I had fallen for a doctor again...

126
00:07:20,769 --> 00:07:23,040
who happened to show up when I was feeling lonely.

127
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,040
But?

128
00:07:25,709 --> 00:07:28,240
But I realized for sure after coming back from the beach.

129
00:07:29,709 --> 00:07:30,879
We have something special.

130
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:38,550
What's that?

131
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,389
Are you thinking...

132
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,690
a doctor's way out of my league...

133
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:45,290
when I was abandoned by two moms?

134
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:47,060
Why would you say that?

135
00:07:47,629 --> 00:07:49,730
I'm afraid you'll get hurt again.

136
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:53,199
I know what you're worried about.

137
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,009
But Dr. Lee's different.

138
00:07:57,569 --> 00:07:58,670
Look at Ji Young Won.

139
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:00,779
She was so sweet, but she ditched me in the end.

140
00:08:02,139 --> 00:08:04,110
Now Dr. Lee is all I have left.

141
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:06,779
He is different.

142
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,490
He'll be different.

143
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,759
My fellow citizens.

144
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,529
My fellow citizens.

145
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:42,579
My fellow citizens.

146
00:08:46,749 --> 00:08:49,989
Then it's a matter of time before Assemblyman Ko's cured, right?

147
00:08:49,989 --> 00:08:51,130
Yes.

148
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:53,999
If he fully recovers, attends his hearing,

149
00:08:53,999 --> 00:08:55,329
and someone mentions the tic,

150
00:08:55,459 --> 00:08:56,859
wouldn't he say that...

151
00:08:56,859 --> 00:08:58,499
the Eun Kang staff cured him?

152
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,270
- You did very well. - Thank you.

153
00:09:12,709 --> 00:09:14,819
(National Assembly, Republic of Korea)

154
00:09:19,819 --> 00:09:20,819
As of this moment,

155
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,829
I stand down...

156
00:09:24,489 --> 00:09:28,199
as a candidate for Minister of Employment and Labor.

157
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,229
The reason...

158
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,040
is not the tic...

159
00:09:36,869 --> 00:09:38,440
that you clearly see I have.

160
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:44,180
For a long time, I worked hard to ensure the safety of...

161
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:46,010
Seoul's subway service,

162
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:50,390
by working to improve the conductors' working environment.

163
00:09:52,589 --> 00:09:55,160
I even made them a promise.

164
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,890
"Make a correction."

165
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,160
- "Make a correction." - Working in teams of two.

166
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,400
Reduced work hours.

167
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:05,869
More safety personnel.

168
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:08,670
Improved working conditions.

169
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:14,410
But I couldn't keep any of those promises.

170
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:19,380
Because of the promises I couldn't keep,

171
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:21,719
not long ago,

172
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,719
another conductor...

173
00:10:26,849 --> 00:10:28,589
lost his life.

174
00:10:37,999 --> 00:10:40,640
The tic you see that I have...

175
00:10:43,339 --> 00:10:46,010
is the price I'm paying for not keeping my word.

176
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:52,910
I'm not the one who can cure your illness.

177
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,050
You are.

178
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:00,959
Of course, we can reduce the symptoms with medication,

179
00:11:02,219 --> 00:11:04,430
but that's only a temporary remedy.

180
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:06,790
The true treatment...

181
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,300
is something only you can do.

182
00:11:12,229 --> 00:11:16,400
Thanks to him, I was able to look back.

183
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:22,239
Now I feel much at ease.

184
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:27,780
From now on, as an assemblyman,

185
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:31,619
I'll improve employee stability, abolish discrimination,

186
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:34,319
and improve working conditions by reforming existing laws.

187
00:11:35,359 --> 00:11:38,390
So that those who work in the low places, behind the scenes...

188
00:11:38,589 --> 00:11:41,060
can receive fair pay for their labor,

189
00:11:41,829 --> 00:11:44,900
I will put in all my effort.

190
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,670
- Assemblyman. - I have a question.

191
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:50,099
- Can I ask something? - I have a question!

192
00:11:50,099 --> 00:11:52,709
(Eun Kang Medical Center)

193
00:11:52,709 --> 00:11:55,180
If you found the cause, you should've treated him.

194
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:56,410
You sent him away?

195
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,249
The tic was caused by...

196
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:00,949
acute stress due to guilt.

197
00:12:00,949 --> 00:12:03,790
I believed he had to be free from that to be completely cured.

198
00:12:04,319 --> 00:12:06,749
He's the only one who knows how to free himself.

199
00:12:06,849 --> 00:12:08,119
Why do doctors exist?

200
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,119
If guilt is what caused his tic,

201
00:12:10,119 --> 00:12:12,989
you're supposed to do everything you can to treat him.

202
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,800
Why would you make him overcome it on his own?

203
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,069
I came to a conclusion that it'd be way faster for him...

204
00:12:19,069 --> 00:12:21,099
to overcome it on his own by actually keeping his promise...

205
00:12:21,099 --> 00:12:22,800
rather than relying on medication and psychotherapy.

206
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,109
Are you saying you made him leave so he'd keep his promise?

207
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:29,310
Well, that wasn't my intention.

208
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,109
But I guess that's how he understood it.

209
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:35,650
You just had to use medication to ease his condition...

210
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:38,790
so he could attend the hearing. Was that so hard to do?

211
00:12:39,089 --> 00:12:40,390
Everyone does that.

212
00:12:41,589 --> 00:12:43,420
You pretty much neglected a patient.

213
00:12:43,719 --> 00:12:45,729
You could've treated him, but you didn't.

214
00:12:45,989 --> 00:12:47,300
I never neglected him.

215
00:12:48,699 --> 00:12:50,030
And I never gave up on treating him either.

216
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,829
As his doctor,

217
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,199
I chose a different method rather than medication...

218
00:12:54,199 --> 00:12:55,999
which would've only been a temporary solution.

219
00:12:56,739 --> 00:12:58,709
And I don't think my method was wrong.

220
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:01,339
More importantly,

221
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,780
in order for him to fully recover...

222
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:04,780
"Fully recover"?

223
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:07,150
You talk as if this is some kind of surgery.

224
00:13:07,479 --> 00:13:08,949
There's no full recovery in psychiatry.

225
00:13:08,979 --> 00:13:10,079
It's a life-long journey.

226
00:13:11,589 --> 00:13:13,589
You're so arrogant.

227
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,489
You are one incredible doctor.

228
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,459
How could you treat an illness without medication?

229
00:13:18,729 --> 00:13:20,190
It's impossible.

230
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:22,229
How can we think of building a medical psychiatry center...

231
00:13:22,229 --> 00:13:23,760
when we can't even treat a tic disorder?

232
00:13:25,069 --> 00:13:28,540
Dr. Oh and Dr. Park. I want you guys to think this over.

233
00:13:30,739 --> 00:13:32,469
Okay, ma'am.

234
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,880
My gosh.

235
00:13:42,249 --> 00:13:45,219
Sir, do you really think I made the wrong choice?

236
00:13:47,989 --> 00:13:49,459
Was that really your best choice?

237
00:13:49,619 --> 00:13:50,660
Yes.

238
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:57,369
I'm on my way to do a lecture for the training. You should come.

239
00:13:57,369 --> 00:13:58,400
"Training"?

240
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:01,599
Isn't that for 1st and 2nd-year residents?

241
00:14:01,599 --> 00:14:02,599
So what?

242
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:06,440
Why is he so angry?

243
00:14:07,709 --> 00:14:08,810
Okay, I'll go.

244
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,550
Now, we're going to practice how to deal with a crisis...

245
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:16,150
that sometimes occur to doctors during treatment.

246
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:19,420
The most frequent type of crisis...

247
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,219
is meeting a violent patient.

248
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:26,760
Dr. Lee, come here.

249
00:14:27,999 --> 00:14:29,900
- Me? - Come on.

250
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:38,709
Let's think of Dr. Lee...

251
00:14:38,709 --> 00:14:41,040
as a violent patient.

252
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,510
Okay. Now, come at me.

253
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,349
My gosh, I can't do that in front of the kids.

254
00:14:47,349 --> 00:14:48,449
It's okay. Come on.

255
00:14:48,579 --> 00:14:49,619
My goodness.

256
00:14:51,589 --> 00:14:53,249
- Come on. - My gosh.

257
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:01,900
Did you see that?

258
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:03,630
This is how you oppress violent patients.

259
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:05,829
What was that for?

260
00:15:07,499 --> 00:15:08,499
Take him back to his seat.

261
00:15:08,499 --> 00:15:11,810
My gosh, my back hurts. I don't think I can move.

262
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:13,540
- Wait a minute. - Are you okay?

263
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,239
- It hurts so much. - You're being a crybaby.

264
00:15:15,239 --> 00:15:16,410
Take him back to his seat. Go on.

265
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:17,479
Okay.

266
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:18,810
Stop exaggerating.

267
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,680
Things would be very simple if we could do what I just did,

268
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,819
but I'm sure not a lot of doctors know how to do that.

269
00:15:26,989 --> 00:15:28,020
Right?

270
00:15:28,619 --> 00:15:30,219
Young Seok, turn off the lights.

271
00:15:30,459 --> 00:15:31,489
Okay.

272
00:15:36,099 --> 00:15:38,469
When you encounter a violent patient,

273
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,430
- what's most important... - Gosh, my back.

274
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:42,369
- is to keep yourself safe. - This is killing me.

275
00:15:42,369 --> 00:15:43,440
Dr. Lee.

276
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:45,440
Does it hurt that much?

277
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:47,109
Dr. Noh.

278
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,910
- I can't... - Woo Jung.

279
00:15:49,479 --> 00:15:50,579
Yes, sir.

280
00:15:50,579 --> 00:15:52,979
What do you need to do when a patient refuses medication?

281
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:57,449
First, you must ask them why they're worried, scared,

282
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:01,560
or feel reluctant to medication and hear them out.

283
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:05,430
You must remind them that the pros of taking medication...

284
00:16:05,829 --> 00:16:08,430
are far greater than the possible side effects...

285
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:09,599
that may or may not occur.

286
00:16:09,699 --> 00:16:10,829
I never asked you.

287
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:17,910
- Sir. - Yes?

288
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:22,239
Many patients experience transference during treatment.

289
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:24,079
How are we supposed to deal with that?

290
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:25,880
Dr. Lee, why don't you answer the question?

291
00:16:28,579 --> 00:16:30,949
Well, when a patient experiences transference,

292
00:16:31,489 --> 00:16:33,989
you must maintain a neutral attitude.

293
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,959
And it's important not to get swayed by how they treat you.

294
00:16:37,589 --> 00:16:39,560
You must remember that you're a doctor...

295
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,699
and do your best to remain objective.

296
00:16:44,099 --> 00:16:45,130
And most importantly,

297
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,339
it's crucial to treat your patient like you always have.

298
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:05,019
She's so happy.

299
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:07,190
Hello. Hello.

300
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:09,259
- Hello. - Hi.

301
00:17:09,259 --> 00:17:10,559
We're here.

302
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,959
My gosh, I'm starving.

303
00:17:14,259 --> 00:17:15,559
Is it just the three of you?

304
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,229
Young Seok and Yoo Mi are going to eat at the hospital.

305
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,910
- Thank you. - No problem.

306
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,809
What should I eat today?

307
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,949
Excuse me.

308
00:17:32,809 --> 00:17:34,549
I'm sick of getting spam calls.

309
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:36,920
Hey, what's the name of this song?

310
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,390
I don't know the name of the song.

311
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:41,259
I just downloaded it because I liked it.

312
00:17:41,259 --> 00:17:43,420
It's "Vocalise" by Rachmaninoff.

313
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:45,390
Do you like classical music?

314
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:49,330
My sister majored in cello. She was in a symphony orchestra.

315
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,699
Stop talking nonsense and just eat your food.

316
00:17:51,999 --> 00:17:53,499
- You'll get your meals soon. - Okay.

317
00:17:53,499 --> 00:17:54,670
- Thank you. - Thank you.

318
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:58,610
Why is your sister no longer in a symphony orchestra?

319
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,410
She told me not to talk nonsense.

320
00:18:01,209 --> 00:18:02,239
Just eat.

321
00:18:02,239 --> 00:18:04,080
Dr. Lee, aren't you coming to eat dinner?

322
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,549
I need to go home.

323
00:18:06,049 --> 00:18:08,549
I need to do a live podcast today.

324
00:18:08,549 --> 00:18:09,820
I haven't recorded anything yet.

325
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:10,850
I see.

326
00:18:11,989 --> 00:18:13,049
"Podcast"?

327
00:18:13,049 --> 00:18:14,759
Did you get a call from the Social Welfare Team?

328
00:18:14,989 --> 00:18:16,489
There's stage therapy tomorrow.

329
00:18:16,719 --> 00:18:18,059
Yes, I got the call.

330
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,830
If we have time after the stage therapy,

331
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,529
- let's have our therapy session. - Okay.

332
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:23,630

334
00:18:38,449 --> 00:18:39,979
- Here's your food. - Thank you.

335
00:18:39,979 --> 00:18:40,979
Thank you.

336
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:44,350
Where are you going?

337
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:49,620
Everyone feels anxious.

338
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:52,489
We look left and right before we cross the street.

339
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:54,860
We wear seatbelts.

340
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:58,529
We don't leave our homes when there's a storm.

341
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,870
We may not be able to acknowledge it,

342
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:05,309
but anxiety helps us get through all the difficult moments...

343
00:19:05,469 --> 00:19:07,539
we often encounter in life.

344
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:11,979
The first place that perceives anxiety...

345
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:15,680
is our amygdala which is located deep down the limbic system.

346
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:18,120
And in order to calm the anxiety we feel,

347
00:19:18,289 --> 00:19:21,890
we need certain types of neurotransmitters such as serotonin,

348
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:23,660
GABA, and norepinephrine.

349
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:27,090
Neurotransmitters are created...

350
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:29,259
by a certain person or a thing.

351
00:19:29,999 --> 00:19:31,830
It could be someone you know...

352
00:19:32,269 --> 00:19:35,199
or your favorite activity.

353
00:19:39,009 --> 00:19:43,009
Anxiety can be divided into normal and pathological anxiety.

354
00:19:43,509 --> 00:19:45,680
And it's the latter one that causes problems.

355
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:48,479
Pathological anxiety...

356
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,420
is when you try to avoid certain things or situations...

357
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,749
that aren't normally considered as threats.

358
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:56,890
For example, I'm talking about people with panic disorders,

359
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:59,090
social anxiety, or social phobia...

360
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:01,330
which is when people have difficulties forming relationships.

361
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,900
I just got a message.

362
00:20:08,199 --> 00:20:11,110
"I get anxious every time I become close with someone."

363
00:20:11,539 --> 00:20:13,969
"I get scared that they might abandon me."

364
00:20:14,009 --> 00:20:16,979
"And I fear that they might become miserable because of me."

365
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,390
To be honest, I also have a psychological illness.

366
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:27,219
I get extremely scared...

367
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:30,320
when I'm faced with a certain situation.

368
00:20:31,259 --> 00:20:33,660
I have an offer to the person who sent me this message.

369
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,360
Why don't we overcome our illnesses together?

370
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,630
- Sure. - We can't live in fear forever...

371
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:40,269
just because we have anxiety disorders.

372
00:20:40,499 --> 00:20:44,199
Let's be confident and try our best to overcome this.

373
00:20:44,199 --> 00:20:45,239
Okay.

374
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,180
To be frank, we're all sick in some ways.

375
00:20:53,549 --> 00:20:55,620
We just haven't gotten diagnosed yet.

376
00:20:56,549 --> 00:20:57,789
A psychical disorder...

377
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,350
isn't a characteristic. It is a person's condition.

378
00:21:00,549 --> 00:21:02,120
Therefore,

379
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:05,930
it can always change depending on the situation I'm in.

380
00:21:06,259 --> 00:21:07,289
In other words,

381
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:10,799
your illness will go away once your condition gets better.

382
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:15,269
And that is why the best medicine is to have a peaceful mind.

383
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:43,630
This is the Soul Repairman.

384
00:22:00,479 --> 00:22:01,549
Hey, you're here.

385
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:05,219
I can hardly recognize you outside.

386
00:22:06,989 --> 00:22:07,989
How do you feel?

387
00:22:07,989 --> 00:22:09,420
I feel a lot better now.

388
00:22:10,259 --> 00:22:11,989
I can come outside now.

389
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:17,199
Why are you sitting so far away?

390
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:21,600
I still feel uncomfortable around men.

391
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:24,370
You're a guy, too.

392
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:28,910
Okay then. You can listen from there.

393
00:22:30,009 --> 00:22:31,880
Everyone's worried about you.

394
00:22:32,049 --> 00:22:36,320
I was surprised to get a call from Ji Hee.

395
00:22:38,989 --> 00:22:42,019
I don't think you'd want to get treated by a male doctor.

396
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:46,059
So I'll introduce you to a female doctor. Is that okay?

397
00:22:47,489 --> 00:22:49,360
I've actually been looking for one.

398
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:51,969
Thank you.

399
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:56,739
Lots of fun things are happening at the hospital.

400
00:22:56,739 --> 00:22:58,509
You should quickly come back if you don't want to be a loner.

401
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:01,039
I already agreed to have a meal with the others.

402
00:23:07,949 --> 00:23:10,820
Six conductors will be getting treated for their panic disorders.

403
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,719
I'm going to do counseling with them first.

404
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,120
And once that's over,

405
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,660
Woo Jung will give them exposure therapy.

406
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:16,920
Okay, sir.

407
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,959
I also requested for stage therapy to the Social Welfare Team.

408
00:23:18,959 --> 00:23:20,630
- Se Chan, you give me the updates. - Okay.

409
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:22,299
How many people do you plan to treat in total?

410
00:23:22,299 --> 00:23:24,799
The labor union gave me a list of 15 people for now.

411
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,969
I'm also ready to take photos.

412
00:23:26,969 --> 00:23:28,940
- Photos for what? - The deputy director told us...

413
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,940
that today is going to be a historical day for our hospital.

414
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:33,209
So he wants me to take photos and send them to the PR Team.

415
00:23:33,469 --> 00:23:35,809
He also wants us to take a group photo.

416
00:23:35,809 --> 00:23:36,809
Is he nuts?

417
00:23:37,539 --> 00:23:39,180
Does he want to disclose our patients?

418
00:23:56,029 --> 00:23:58,870
Sir, what do you mean you can't come?

419
00:24:05,769 --> 00:24:08,809
I'm sorry. I know you're trying to help.

420
00:24:12,479 --> 00:24:14,680
But if I go to the hospital,

421
00:24:15,449 --> 00:24:17,320
there won't be anyone to replace me.

422
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:20,989
Sir, are you okay?

423
00:24:22,489 --> 00:24:24,190
Sir, are you really okay?

424
00:24:25,789 --> 00:24:27,999
Okay, I'll quickly call you back.

425
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:29,100
Okay, bye.

426
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:34,400
None of the conductors can make it today.

427
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:35,699
Why?

428
00:24:43,239 --> 00:24:44,239
Dr. In.

429
00:24:45,979 --> 00:24:48,320
- Where are you going? - Seoul Metro.

430
00:24:48,749 --> 00:24:49,779
Are you going to complain?

431
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:52,190
We already settled everything with their superiors...

432
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,920
and even set an appointment. This is absurd.

433
00:24:54,019 --> 00:24:55,590
Don't they know whom we're doing this for?

434
00:24:56,489 --> 00:24:58,330
How could they tell a guy...

435
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,529
who gets panic attacks every single day...

436
00:25:00,529 --> 00:25:01,999
to go to work instead of the hospital?

437
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,229
How did he sound over the phone just now?

438
00:25:04,229 --> 00:25:06,600
He had trouble breathing. I'll see you when I get back.

439
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,600
Wait.

440
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:11,140
Why don't we just go to them?

441
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,539
What?

442
00:25:12,539 --> 00:25:14,469
If they're short of hands and don't have time to come here,

443
00:25:14,469 --> 00:25:15,640
we can go to them instead.

444
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,180
You can go to Seoul Metro and complain to their superiors,

445
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:21,249
but his condition seems urgent, so let's deal with that first.

446
00:25:21,449 --> 00:25:22,680
What do you plan to do there?

447
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:25,090
Are you going to do therapy while they drive the subway?

448
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:26,489
That's not even necessary.

449
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:28,190
What they need to know...

450
00:25:28,289 --> 00:25:30,219
is that they're not alone.

451
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:35,830
Dr. In, you're the doctor in charge, so it's up to you.

452
00:25:36,299 --> 00:25:37,459
If you don't want me to go, I won't.

453
00:25:44,769 --> 00:25:46,769
- Se Chan. - Yes, sir?

454
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:49,380
I want you to call the operation control center...

455
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:51,949
and ask them which subway station we need to go to at what time...

456
00:25:51,949 --> 00:25:54,380
in order to get on the subway that's driven by Mr. Park Jong Woo.

457
00:25:54,479 --> 00:25:55,749
Okay, sir.

458
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,820
Go and deal with what's urgent.

459
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,590
I'll take care of the rest.

460
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:02,719
My gosh, get going already.

461
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:08,959
We have an hour to get to the station.

462
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:13,529
Hello.

463
00:26:14,199 --> 00:26:15,699
- You're here already? - I came a bit early, didn't I?

464
00:26:16,299 --> 00:26:18,610
Oh, dear. Stage therapy got canceled today.

465
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:20,739
- Why? - I should've called beforehand.

466
00:26:20,739 --> 00:26:21,809
I'm sorry.

467
00:26:33,449 --> 00:26:34,489
What?

468
00:26:34,489 --> 00:26:36,590
They went all the way there to treat the conductor?

469
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,259
Yes, I also wanted to go, but I didn't.

470
00:26:41,229 --> 00:26:43,600
Sir, I'm very confident about treating panic disorder.

471
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,969
I've been doing a lot of research about drug treatment too.

472
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:48,340
Please help me so I can treat them, sir.

473
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,269
We already offered to treat them,

474
00:26:51,269 --> 00:26:52,670
but they rejected it.

475
00:26:53,739 --> 00:26:55,809
Is there a way to change their minds?

476
00:26:56,279 --> 00:26:59,350
I might pack up some meds and visit them myself next time.

477
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:00,809
You're starting to sound like Si Joon.

478
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,920
I don't ever want to be like him.

479
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,249
But when it comes to treating panic disorder,

480
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,489
I'm more than willing to do it his way if necessary.

481
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:12,059
The director is upset about what happened with Assemblyman Ko.

482
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:14,860
But I guess we could talk to her.

483
00:27:15,199 --> 00:27:16,830
Please help me, sir.

484
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,499
- Is this it? - Yes.

485
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:21,469
We need to get on the next train.

486
00:27:21,469 --> 00:27:22,670
If we miss it, we need to go to another station.

487
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:24,199
- How much time do we have? - Two minutes.

488
00:27:28,539 --> 00:27:31,410
The train is now approaching.

489
00:27:31,779 --> 00:27:34,309
The inner circle line is now approaching.

490
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:39,219
The screen doors are opening.

491
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:46,489
The screen doors are closing.

492
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:31,100
Yes, how can I help you?

493
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:32,940
Hello, is this Mr. Park?

494
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,380
- Who is this? - I'm Dr. Lee Si Joon,

495
00:28:35,539 --> 00:28:37,340
a psychiatrist at Eun Kang Medical Center.

496
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:40,009
You didn't come to the hospital today,

497
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:41,150
so we came instead.

498
00:28:41,479 --> 00:28:43,219
How do you feel right now?

499
00:28:43,479 --> 00:28:44,580
Is everything okay?

500
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:47,989
You... You came all the way here?

501
00:28:48,459 --> 00:28:51,190
I'm right next to you, sir.

502
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:53,459
I'm right behind the door.

503
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:55,130
So don't worry and drive safely.

504
00:28:56,059 --> 00:28:59,699
I'm going to stay with you until we reach the last station.

505
00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:02,269
And nothing will happen during that time.

506
00:29:02,499 --> 00:29:05,340
So don't worry and drive safely.

507
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,340
Okay.

508
00:29:18,449 --> 00:29:20,650
I feel relieved to hear you cry.

509
00:29:20,789 --> 00:29:23,660
I was worried that you might be out of breath.

510
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:24,789
But I guess that's not it.

511
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:28,229
Sir, you're not alone.

512
00:29:28,959 --> 00:29:29,959
Don't worry.

513
00:29:48,009 --> 00:29:49,680
Cheer up, sir.

514
00:29:52,719 --> 00:29:53,789
Did you hear that?

515
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:55,590
You're not alone.

516
00:29:55,989 --> 00:29:58,019
We're all right behind you.

517
00:30:00,529 --> 00:30:01,959
- Cheer up. - Cheer up.

518
00:30:01,959 --> 00:30:03,160
- We respect you. - Cheer up.

519
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,600
- Cheer up. - You're amazing.

520
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:06,100
You can do it, sir.

521
00:30:08,969 --> 00:30:13,870
Every time we drive a subway, it lasts three hours.

522
00:30:15,479 --> 00:30:16,610
But we're pretty much...

523
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:20,180
inside a tunnel during the whole time.

524
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:23,820
I really thought I might die earlier.

525
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:27,289
But you saved my life.

526
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:30,620
The fact that someone's next to me...

527
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:33,759
is more than enough to put me at ease.

528
00:30:34,029 --> 00:30:37,360
I'm sure you already heard this from the doctor you previously met,

529
00:30:37,759 --> 00:30:40,370
but let me remind you that your panic disorder can be cured...

530
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:41,969
by taking drugs and doing a few exercises.

531
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:45,870
You should come to the hospital and get it treated.

532
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:48,940
We can't always come here to treat you.

533
00:30:50,009 --> 00:30:54,080
Okay, I'll go to the hospital with my colleagues.

534
00:31:01,935 --> 00:31:03,405
(Episode 16)

535
00:31:46,887 --> 00:31:47,887
Hello.

536
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,010
Hello.

537
00:31:50,111 --> 00:31:52,651
I'm the deputy director of this hospital.

538
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,950
Oh, I see.

539
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:57,420
You're the actor who helps our stage therapy sessions, right?

540
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,420
How did you know that?

541
00:32:00,521 --> 00:32:03,120
Oh. I saw you last time.

542
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:05,291
- Walking with Dr. Lee. - I see.

543
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:09,360
I recognized you just now and came over to say hi.

544
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:12,970
What are you doing here? Are you waiting for someone?

545
00:32:13,441 --> 00:32:16,071
I'm waiting for Dr. Lee.

546
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:21,140
Have you two known for a long time?

547
00:32:21,241 --> 00:32:23,480
We met over a patient called Cha Dong Il.

548
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,911
Oh, that's right.

549
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:28,720
He gave you a hard time, didn't he?

550
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:33,120
Still, thanks to that incident, I met Dr. Lee.

551
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,260
I see.

552
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,571
The conductors didn't show up today?

553
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:46,331
I'm trying to sort that out now.

554
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:48,170
Is it so hard to come here?

555
00:32:48,271 --> 00:32:50,110
Forget about that for now. Come with me.

556
00:32:52,211 --> 00:32:53,310
Where are you going?

557
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,480
What?

558
00:32:55,941 --> 00:32:58,411
What nonsense are you talking about?

559
00:32:58,411 --> 00:32:59,651
Exactly.

560
00:32:59,881 --> 00:33:02,951
It makes so little sense that I came straight over.

561
00:33:03,051 --> 00:33:05,391
Dating a patient? Is he in his right mind?

562
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:08,861
Mr. Deputy Director. Dr. Lee isn't dating Ms. Han.

563
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:10,761
I just confirmed it myself!

564
00:33:10,931 --> 00:33:12,630
I asked Ms. Han in person!

565
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:16,261
What is it you really want to say?

566
00:33:16,261 --> 00:33:17,271
What do you mean?

567
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:21,000
A psychiatrist is dating one of his patients.

568
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:23,171
What if the word were to get out?

569
00:33:23,171 --> 00:33:24,840
Our center will be humiliated.

570
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:27,880
Our image already hit rock bottom because of Assemblyman Ko.

571
00:33:27,981 --> 00:33:30,611
Si Joon did mess up with his treatment of the assemblyman.

572
00:33:30,711 --> 00:33:34,151
But even if we consider that, don't you think this is crass?

573
00:33:34,151 --> 00:33:37,190
What? Crass? What's crass? How is this crass?

574
00:33:37,421 --> 00:33:39,421
Do you think I'm making a fuss over nothing?

575
00:33:39,891 --> 00:33:43,991
Dr. In, you tell me. You saw them walking with their arms linked.

576
00:33:43,991 --> 00:33:44,991
Sir, that was...

577
00:33:44,991 --> 00:33:46,801
Did you see it or not? Yes or no?

578
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:49,530
Is it true?

579
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,540
Yes.

580
00:34:03,511 --> 00:34:06,051
- You did well today. - Thanks.

581
00:34:06,051 --> 00:34:07,921
Woo Jung, check on the inpatients.

582
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:08,981
I will.

583
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,891
- Good job, doctor. - Good job.

584
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:18,630
Woo Joo.

585
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:24,070
When did you come over? I kept an eye out.

586
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:25,301
Were you waiting for me?

587
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:27,600
I just couldn't go home.

588
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:43,521
Why couldn't you go home?

589
00:34:47,421 --> 00:34:48,560
My finger...

590
00:34:50,331 --> 00:34:51,991
hurt so much.

591
00:34:52,961 --> 00:34:54,030
How come?

592
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:58,570
When you ran past me,

593
00:34:59,901 --> 00:35:03,070
your jacket brushed my hand.

594
00:35:04,111 --> 00:35:06,040
It was just cloth,

595
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:10,011
but it hurt so much as if I'd been cut by a knife.

596
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:12,951
As if it were a real knife.

597
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:17,121
I couldn't take a step after that.

598
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:24,490
Have you ever experienced something like that before?

599
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:26,461
When was that?

600
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:30,631
When my adoptive mother gave me up,

601
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:35,371
she took me back to the orphanage.

602
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:40,780
She gave me a five-dollar bill...

603
00:35:41,711 --> 00:35:43,040
and turned away.

604
00:35:44,251 --> 00:35:45,451
The hem of...

605
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:50,951
the skirt she was wearing brushed by my fingers.

606
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:56,021
At that time as well, my fingers stung and hurt...

607
00:35:56,621 --> 00:35:58,391
as if I'd been cut by a knife.

608
00:36:06,871 --> 00:36:07,941
What are you doing?

609
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:11,441
Touch this. See if it cuts you.

610
00:36:11,811 --> 00:36:15,211
That's just how it felt to me. I'm not saying I was really cut.

611
00:36:20,521 --> 00:36:21,521
Happy now?

612
00:36:25,951 --> 00:36:27,660
You felt that way...

613
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:30,191
because of...

614
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:33,761
your painful memories.

615
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,230
Dr. Lee.

616
00:36:37,131 --> 00:36:39,131
Am I very sick?

617
00:36:40,501 --> 00:36:42,300
Tell me honestly.

618
00:36:44,511 --> 00:36:47,141
Dr. Ji Young Won sent me to you.

619
00:36:48,881 --> 00:36:50,110
Dr. Ji said...

620
00:36:51,311 --> 00:36:53,110
it was a collaboration between doctors.

621
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,381
Am I so badly broken somewhere that...

622
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:59,521
two doctors need to collaborate to treat me?

623
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:01,160
Woo Joo.

624
00:37:03,691 --> 00:37:05,331
I'm sick myself.

625
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:06,490
How so?

626
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:10,331
My soul catches a cold often.

627
00:37:11,071 --> 00:37:12,131
For no reason.

628
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,970
The people I go to for healing...

629
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,670
are my patients.

630
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:22,581
I gain comfort and solace by treating them.

631
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:27,350
The drum beats you played for me were a great help and comfort.

632
00:37:28,321 --> 00:37:32,451
Whenever I feel down, I think of your performance,

633
00:37:33,321 --> 00:37:35,021
and it makes me feel better.

634
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:40,501
I said this on my podcast yesterday,

635
00:37:41,831 --> 00:37:43,670
but there's no person who isn't sick.

636
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,871
They just haven't been diagnosed yet.

637
00:37:49,641 --> 00:37:51,071
While treating you,

638
00:37:51,941 --> 00:37:53,910
I'm treating myself.

639
00:37:57,011 --> 00:37:58,211
Just a moment.

640
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,581
(Drum Beats)

641
00:38:05,691 --> 00:38:08,660
I just sent you the drum beat.

642
00:38:10,691 --> 00:38:12,660
Listen to it whenever your soul catches a cold.

643
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:17,571
I read somewhere that this works really well.

644
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:22,340
When you listen to the drums, think of my performance too.

645
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,771
I'll share something else next time.

646
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:25,970
Okay.

647
00:38:27,081 --> 00:38:28,680
Okay. Then...

648
00:38:29,441 --> 00:38:31,151
how about we two patients...

649
00:38:32,311 --> 00:38:33,581
do a high-five?

650
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:35,451
Okay.

651
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:40,021
Come on.

652
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:41,321
Once more.

653
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:43,220
1, 2.

654
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,461
I knew you'd do that.

655
00:38:45,631 --> 00:38:47,061
- 1, 2. - 3!

656
00:38:49,501 --> 00:38:50,730
- Gosh. - One last time.

657
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:51,800
1, 2, 3.

658
00:38:54,641 --> 00:38:57,511
I think Dr. Lee's really amazing.

659
00:38:57,610 --> 00:38:59,871
How could he think of visiting his patients?

660
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:02,680
He doesn't see his patients just in his office.

661
00:39:03,511 --> 00:39:07,021
Whether it's their home or work, he follows them all over the place.

662
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:09,621
I wish I could join Dr. Lee's team.

663
00:39:09,821 --> 00:39:11,590
Should I ask Dr. In to send me?

664
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:14,590
Se Chan. Dr. In might give you extra work.

665
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:18,790
I heard that patients are already comparing the two doctors.

666
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:29,101
I got dumped even before sharing my feelings to Si Joon.

667
00:39:29,101 --> 00:39:30,540
Before I even said anything.

668
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:33,881
Dong Hyuk. I feel the worst ever.

669
00:39:33,881 --> 00:39:35,341
What happened now?

670
00:39:35,381 --> 00:39:37,550
A patient dumped me. Han Woo Joo.

671
00:39:39,011 --> 00:39:41,481
She found out I sent her to Si Joon...

672
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:43,680
and blamed me for abandoning her.

673
00:39:44,721 --> 00:39:45,950
She's borderline.

674
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:48,320
Isn't it natural for her to get angry over such things?

675
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:51,131
It's a complete and serious case of transference.

676
00:39:52,091 --> 00:39:53,460
She relies on Si Joon a lot.

677
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:57,700
Does Si Joon know that too?

678
00:39:57,731 --> 00:39:58,800
Of course.

679
00:39:59,001 --> 00:40:00,501
It'll be hard on him too.

680
00:40:00,841 --> 00:40:02,971
He can't do anything.

681
00:40:05,241 --> 00:40:07,011
Then I don't have to worry.

682
00:40:07,481 --> 00:40:09,741
About what? Is something wrong?

683
00:40:09,841 --> 00:40:11,950
Our deputy director thinks they're dating.

684
00:40:12,111 --> 00:40:14,351
And? Did he make a fuss of it?

685
00:40:14,521 --> 00:40:15,950
Is there a scandal?

686
00:40:16,221 --> 00:40:18,351
It could be bad if word gets out.

687
00:40:19,721 --> 00:40:22,491
It seems to be okay so far.

688
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:27,330
If it becomes an issue, you should help him out.

689
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:30,401
Why should I do that?

690
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,670
I will stop standing in Si Joon's shadow.

691
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:41,011
What do you mean?

692
00:40:41,341 --> 00:40:43,881
I'll send over a patient. She's one of our residents.

693
00:40:43,881 --> 00:40:45,851
She has social phobia and anxiety issues.

694
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:50,420
Don't change the subject. What were you trying to say?

695
00:41:04,871 --> 00:41:06,300
What kind of patient is Han Woo Joo?

696
00:41:11,241 --> 00:41:12,310
A borderline.

697
00:41:13,641 --> 00:41:14,641
What?

698
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:18,050
You let a borderline patient do stage therapy?

699
00:41:18,151 --> 00:41:19,710
I found out after I asked her to do it.

700
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:22,251
Why does that matter?

701
00:41:22,251 --> 00:41:23,851
She's doing so well on stage therapy.

702
00:41:25,221 --> 00:41:27,320
We shouldn't be the ones discriminating patients...

703
00:41:27,861 --> 00:41:29,121
when our goal is to stop them from being discriminated.

704
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:32,631
Is Han Woo Joo experiencing transference right now?

705
00:41:35,001 --> 00:41:36,060
How did you know?

706
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,700
The deputy director said you two are going out.

707
00:41:39,901 --> 00:41:41,040
You're not, right?

708
00:41:41,371 --> 00:41:42,800
What are you talking about?

709
00:41:44,241 --> 00:41:45,611
I know it too.

710
00:41:46,371 --> 00:41:47,981
If I just wait patiently,

711
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:49,540
her condition will improve on its own,

712
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:51,651
so I'm just waiting.

713
00:41:52,381 --> 00:41:53,981
Then why did you link arms with her?

714
00:41:55,981 --> 00:41:59,021
That's because she acted so suddenly.

715
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,690
If I refused, she could've been embarrassed.

716
00:42:02,221 --> 00:42:06,231
Then she could've been hurt again or something.

717
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:08,460
You better be careful.

718
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:10,501
The deputy director is waiting for you to make a mistake,

719
00:42:10,501 --> 00:42:13,001
and the director is also sensitive because of Assemblyman Ko.

720
00:42:13,401 --> 00:42:15,871
No good will come from this if the director finds out.

721
00:42:16,601 --> 00:42:17,670
Okay.

722
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:20,070
Make sure you draw the line so she's not mistaken.

723
00:42:21,011 --> 00:42:23,611
And never meet her personally besides in the hospital room.

724
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:27,580
Why aren't you answering me?

725
00:42:28,981 --> 00:42:30,991
You sound like my dad who has dementia.

726
00:42:31,091 --> 00:42:32,221
Do you think I'm saying this for no reason?

727
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:34,391
If this is because of what happened eight years ago, don't say it.

728
00:42:35,790 --> 00:42:36,861
It's different from then.

729
00:43:15,231 --> 00:43:16,231
What should I wear?

730
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:48,160

(Cures a Conductor with Panic Disorder)

732
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:54,001
My gosh. How did you think of going there yourself?

733
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:58,070
Mr. Oh, wasn't Dr. In's idea so brilliant?

734
00:43:58,070 --> 00:43:59,971
Dr. In is really unpredictable.

735
00:44:00,511 --> 00:44:02,410
He visited the patient himself, which is rare lately.

736
00:44:03,981 --> 00:44:05,950
You talked with the conductor through an emergency phone?

737
00:44:05,950 --> 00:44:08,780
Ma'am, it wasn't me who went. It was Dr. Lee.

738
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:10,351
Dr. In asked him to go.

739
00:44:10,891 --> 00:44:12,151
Whoever it was,

740
00:44:12,151 --> 00:44:14,591
it's important that you came up with this brilliant idea.

741
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,731
I really lost face because of Assemblyman Ko's issue,

742
00:44:18,091 --> 00:44:20,800
but thanks to you, I suddenly feel so much better.

743
00:44:25,231 --> 00:44:27,741
Dr. Park, did you read the newspaper?

744
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,200
Dr. In did something truly amazing.

745
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,371
Yes, I just read it.

746
00:44:32,641 --> 00:44:34,710
Dr. In took care of the total mess...

747
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:36,710
Dr. Lee made.

748
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:41,580
Dr. Park, did you check what I said to you yesterday?

749
00:44:43,151 --> 00:44:44,651
He said it's not true.

750
00:44:45,351 --> 00:44:47,391
- What's this about? - Well, it's...

751
00:44:49,221 --> 00:44:50,621
It seems like Dr. Lee...

752
00:44:50,621 --> 00:44:53,290
is in a personal relationship with a patient he's treating.

753
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,530
I told you it's not true.

754
00:44:57,731 --> 00:44:59,501
The patient is just experiencing transference.

755
00:44:59,501 --> 00:45:01,001
I checked myself.

756
00:45:01,001 --> 00:45:02,040
"Transference"?

757
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:05,371
Then they shouldn't have linked arms inside the hospital.

758
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:09,341
They linked arms inside here?

759
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:11,710
Don't take it the wrong way, ma'am.

760
00:45:12,050 --> 00:45:15,050
I'll ask him myself it's I'm mistaken or not then.

761
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:27,601
Did you sleep well?

762
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:31,231
In order to help Ms. Yang sleep better last night,

763
00:45:31,231 --> 00:45:33,830
we gave her a drug with a stronger anxiolytic effect.

764
00:45:34,001 --> 00:45:35,601
Since the effect of sleep improvement...

765
00:45:35,601 --> 00:45:37,070
differs between each patient,

766
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:39,511
why don't we prescribe her an antianxiety drug as well?

767
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:41,080
That sounds good.

768
00:45:43,241 --> 00:45:46,351
She's been sleeping ever since her guardian came last night.

769
00:45:46,651 --> 00:45:48,320
I'll call you when she wakes up.

770
00:45:48,521 --> 00:45:49,550
Okay.

771
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:11,511
Yes.

772
00:46:14,841 --> 00:46:17,680
Did the deputy director tell her?

773
00:46:21,521 --> 00:46:22,820
Explain what?

774
00:46:26,050 --> 00:46:27,121
Okay.

775
00:46:37,430 --> 00:46:39,601
Why didn't you ask me to come to your office?

776
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:41,241
I didn't want to waste your time when you're busy.

777
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:45,210
I heard something that made me feel uncomfortable.

778
00:46:46,210 --> 00:46:47,410
You know what I mean, right?

779
00:46:47,410 --> 00:46:49,611
No, I have no idea what you mean.

780
00:46:50,950 --> 00:46:53,381
I heard you're in a personal relationship with a patient.

781
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:54,881
Is that true?

782
00:46:55,621 --> 00:46:56,621
Did you just scoff?

783
00:46:57,820 --> 00:47:00,190
You must be talking about Han Woo Joo.

784
00:47:03,891 --> 00:47:05,560
She's just a patient to me.

785
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:08,131
Of course there's nothing going on between us.

786
00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:13,871
Explaining this to you like this feels so ridiculous.

787
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,101
Is this because of what happened with Assemblyman Ko?

788
00:47:17,101 --> 00:47:18,810
Dr. Lee, have you lost your mind?

789
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:21,111
Anyone would go nuts after hearing something absurd like this.

790
00:47:24,481 --> 00:47:25,810
I don't regret my decision.

791
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:30,180
It was the best decision I could make as his doctor.

792
00:47:30,381 --> 00:47:33,591
Are you trying to get emotional with me through this attitude?

793
00:47:35,021 --> 00:47:36,021
Fine, then.

794
00:47:36,221 --> 00:47:40,190
Mr. Oh, cut all funding for Dr. Lee's research as of today.

795
00:47:40,861 --> 00:47:44,160
If he wants to go to another hospital, just let him.

796
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,170
Yes, ma'am.

797
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:48,601
If I hear another similar rumor, I won't tolerate it.

798
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:51,641
And that patient you put in charge of stage therapy.

799
00:47:51,841 --> 00:47:53,141
Make her quit immediately.

800
00:48:07,190 --> 00:48:09,121
- When did you come? - Just now.

801
00:48:13,091 --> 00:48:14,160
I made this for you.

802
00:48:19,401 --> 00:48:20,401
Thank you.

803
00:48:21,401 --> 00:48:23,641
- I should get going then. - Wait, Woo Joo.

804
00:48:26,541 --> 00:48:27,611
I'm sorry,

805
00:48:28,611 --> 00:48:30,740
but I'm afraid I can't treat you today.

806
00:48:31,410 --> 00:48:32,551
Something suddenly came up...

807
00:48:33,311 --> 00:48:35,051
so I have to cancel all my appointments.

808
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:39,990
That's a relief. Gongbap Restaurant was so busy today,

809
00:48:40,651 --> 00:48:42,260
so I was thinking of rescheduling anyway.

810
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,291
I'll call you about your new appointment.

811
00:48:45,291 --> 00:48:46,730
Okay. Bye.

813
00:48:56,601 --> 00:48:58,611
I thought Lee Si Joon would be different...

814
00:49:02,910 --> 00:49:04,041
but he wasn't.

815
00:49:04,381 --> 00:49:06,351
He's the same as everyone else.

816
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:08,551
I...

817
00:49:12,121 --> 00:49:14,151
I was abandoned again.

818
00:49:18,391 --> 00:49:19,460
I...

819
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:21,660
I guess I'm really...

820
00:49:22,831 --> 00:49:24,871
a nuisance to everyone.

821
00:49:26,131 --> 00:49:28,500
It's my fault Lee Si Joon became like that...

822
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,341
and I feel so sorry.

823
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:35,240
But I also hate him so much!

824
00:49:38,851 --> 00:49:40,250
I'm sorry, Ji Sun.

825
00:49:40,250 --> 00:49:43,621
I really didn't want to cry in front of you ever again.

826
00:49:43,621 --> 00:49:46,520
I really didn't want to cry...

827
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:50,321
I'm sorry.

828
00:50:46,551 --> 00:50:51,220
First of all, this treatment will use simple tools.

829
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:53,591
You'll practice being exposed to...

830
00:50:53,591 --> 00:50:56,121
the similar emotional, physical changes you feel under fear...

831
00:50:56,121 --> 00:50:58,131
when you have an episode.

832
00:50:58,391 --> 00:51:02,601
First, we'll train for nausea and dizziness.

833
00:51:21,551 --> 00:51:23,680
- Do you feel okay? - I guess.

834
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,331
You have one minute left.

835
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:45,111
That's enough. You can stop now.

836
00:51:45,571 --> 00:51:47,980
Now take a deep breath.

837
00:51:50,111 --> 00:51:53,180
When you have a seizure, you'll feel nauseated,

838
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:55,121
and you will also feel like you can't breathe, like now.

839
00:51:55,121 --> 00:51:57,990
But you have to remember just one thing.

840
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:02,220
Like right now, however nauseous or suffocated you may feel,

841
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:05,561
you will never, ever die.

842
00:52:06,591 --> 00:52:07,631
Remember that.

843
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:10,230
Until now,

844
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:13,571
I did what I could to get over it.

845
00:52:14,371 --> 00:52:16,371
If I'm unable to do that,

846
00:52:17,841 --> 00:52:21,210
I'll become a slave to that incident forever.

847
00:52:22,111 --> 00:52:24,611
For a while, I prayed every day.

848
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:28,480
For those jerks to suffer the same way I did.

849
00:52:30,351 --> 00:52:33,091
Did you feel better afterward?

850
00:52:33,990 --> 00:52:34,990
No.

851
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,591
I just felt worse.

852
00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:41,500
What angers you the most right now?

853
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:43,200
The fact that my photo was taken.

854
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:46,230
There must be something else you feel worse about.

855
00:52:47,970 --> 00:52:49,101
What could that be?

856
00:52:51,571 --> 00:52:53,641
I lost my first case.

857
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:55,910
I'd looked forward to having my own patient.

858
00:52:56,111 --> 00:52:57,180
That's my real loss.

859
00:52:57,910 --> 00:53:00,111
- And? - Financial distress.

860
00:53:00,450 --> 00:53:02,321
Now I have to take a taxi because I can't take the subway.

861
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:09,160
What you should feel most upset about right now...

862
00:53:09,391 --> 00:53:12,930
is that you went from being a doctor to a patient.

863
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:19,531
Because of those losers, you lost your first patient,

864
00:53:19,770 --> 00:53:23,270
you're suffering from social phobia, and you are suffering financially.

865
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:25,111
Isn't that so unfair?

866
00:53:25,210 --> 00:53:27,881
Even I feel vicariously traumatized.

867
00:53:27,881 --> 00:53:30,841
(To feel one's pain as their own.)

868
00:53:31,450 --> 00:53:33,111
You're really right.

869
00:53:34,450 --> 00:53:37,920
You studied so hard to treat your first patient.

870
00:53:38,391 --> 00:53:41,490
How can a doctor become a patient because of those jerks?

871
00:53:44,591 --> 00:53:46,031
I'll guarantee you this.

872
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:49,031
If you overcome this well,

873
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:51,571
when you come across a similar patient,

874
00:53:51,571 --> 00:53:54,170
you'll be able to treat them better than anyone.

875
00:53:54,601 --> 00:53:56,301
I will get better.

876
00:53:56,301 --> 00:53:57,571
I'll help you.

877
00:54:19,861 --> 00:54:20,930
What are you doing?

878
00:54:22,101 --> 00:54:24,131
I heard you're not eating well.

879
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:38,611
I just dropped by.

880
00:54:39,281 --> 00:54:40,851
I had nowhere else to go.

881
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:43,881
Darn it. I want to fold a plane, but I can't.

882
00:54:43,881 --> 00:54:44,990
My gosh.

883
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:46,591
Why fold a plane?

884
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:49,220
I have a 10-year-old son and he asked me to.

885
00:54:50,391 --> 00:54:51,760
You fold one for me.

886
00:55:04,371 --> 00:55:05,811
You have a son.

887
00:55:05,811 --> 00:55:07,240
He's very smart.

888
00:55:27,631 --> 00:55:28,960
Oh, goodness.

889
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,901
My son will love this.

890
00:55:37,970 --> 00:55:39,270
Can you fold a boat too?

891
00:55:48,651 --> 00:55:50,321
Whatever I say today,

892
00:55:51,591 --> 00:55:53,190
you'll just forget.

893
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:56,791
How come you're so good at this?

894
00:56:01,031 --> 00:56:02,301
My father taught me.

895
00:56:02,301 --> 00:56:03,861
I see.

896
00:56:04,101 --> 00:56:07,700
I'll make you a paper boat, tortoise,

897
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:09,841
rabbit, everything.

898
00:56:11,101 --> 00:56:13,940
In return, will you hear my story?

899
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:15,410
Sure thing.

900
00:56:18,811 --> 00:56:19,910
You see,

901
00:56:20,651 --> 00:56:22,621
I think I got transference.

902
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:25,651
To a patient I'm treating.

903
00:56:26,591 --> 00:56:29,190
Oh, dear.

904
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:34,760
Do you even know what that means?

905
00:56:35,401 --> 00:56:39,930
It means you turned into a fish. How can you be a fish?

906
00:56:39,930 --> 00:56:41,270
My gosh.

907
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:44,240
So?

908
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:47,510
Actually,

909
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:50,781
I knew it for a while,

910
00:56:52,281 --> 00:56:53,680
but I denied it.

911
00:56:54,581 --> 00:56:56,781
I didn't want history to repeat itself.

912
00:56:58,291 --> 00:56:59,950
I tried to stop seeing her.

913
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:03,091
I tried to avoid her.

914
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:05,091
But in the end,

915
00:57:06,230 --> 00:57:07,291
here I am.

916
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,170
Here I am as if it was fate.

917
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:16,200
Gosh. You're really good at this.

918
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:20,871
What should I do?

919
00:57:22,210 --> 00:57:23,410
Should I...

920
00:57:25,111 --> 00:57:26,551
keep on running?

921
00:57:27,281 --> 00:57:28,781
Or change direction?

922
00:57:30,651 --> 00:57:31,791
Life is short.

923
00:57:32,591 --> 00:57:34,821
Keep going. Don't turn back.

924
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:37,190
You should always go straight ahead.

925
00:57:38,230 --> 00:57:39,260
Right?

926
00:57:40,791 --> 00:57:44,230
My son will grow up soon, won't he?

927
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:48,700
Yes.

928
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:51,770
When he's older,

929
00:57:54,770 --> 00:57:55,811
I bet...

930
00:57:59,910 --> 00:58:01,051
he will...

931
00:58:02,881 --> 00:58:04,680
make things out of paper for you.

932
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:07,051
Goodness.

933
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:16,460
What is that there?

934
00:58:26,210 --> 00:58:27,740
It's delicious.

935
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:30,480
It's good.

936
00:58:30,841 --> 00:58:32,450
You should have some.

937
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:34,750
It's tasty.

938
00:58:39,121 --> 00:58:41,420
Eat some more.

939
00:59:02,910 --> 00:59:03,980
What's this?

940
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:08,621
Why is no one here?

941
00:59:11,551 --> 00:59:16,420
We love you, Kang Noo Ri!

942
00:59:18,591 --> 00:59:19,760
What's all this?

943
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:21,901
What's that?

944
00:59:22,401 --> 00:59:25,571
Noo Ri. I heard that you love home-cooked food.

945
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,470
We prepared you this.

946
00:59:28,901 --> 00:59:30,601
- Tada. - Tada.

947
00:59:32,710 --> 00:59:34,541
It's amazing.

948
00:59:34,541 --> 00:59:35,781
Noo Ri.

949
00:59:36,281 --> 00:59:37,841
You've been through so much.

950
00:59:40,351 --> 00:59:42,250
Don't look at me cry. It's annoying.

951
00:59:42,250 --> 00:59:43,420
Don't cry.

952
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:46,121
- This is great. - Eat all you want.

953
00:59:46,351 --> 00:59:47,920
Thank you.

954
00:59:48,220 --> 00:59:49,960
- Said who? - Try this.

955
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:51,020
That's enough.

956
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:53,291
- We'll take turns feeding you. - What?

957
00:59:53,930 --> 00:59:55,861
Can you give me some of that?

958
00:59:56,660 --> 00:59:57,730
Come on.

959
00:59:57,730 --> 00:59:59,571
- This too. - Do you want some?

960
00:59:59,770 --> 01:00:00,871
I ate a lot earlier.

961
01:00:00,871 --> 01:00:02,301
- Thank you. - Thanks.

962
01:00:02,301 --> 01:00:03,601
- Okay. - Thank you.

963
01:00:03,601 --> 01:00:05,470
- It's delicious. - Seriously.

964
01:00:05,470 --> 01:00:07,571
- It's so good. - Oh, what I meant is...

965
01:00:07,571 --> 01:00:08,811
I'm correct, right?

966
01:00:08,811 --> 01:00:09,841
Will you stop?

967
01:00:09,841 --> 01:00:11,210
Can we please eat?

968
01:00:11,381 --> 01:00:13,510
- Please. Let's eat. - Okay.

969
01:00:13,781 --> 01:00:15,821
- Sorry. - I just wanted to ask.

970
01:00:15,821 --> 01:00:17,581
- But... - What about this?

971
01:00:17,581 --> 01:00:18,920
It's delicious.

972
01:00:19,121 --> 01:00:20,891
- Well... - It's not true, right?

973
01:00:20,891 --> 01:00:22,020
Come on.

974
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:24,391
- What was that about? - What?

975
01:01:22,950 --> 01:01:25,851
(Fix You)

976
01:01:26,121 --> 01:01:28,621
Why were you nice to me? You just confused me!

977
01:01:29,190 --> 01:01:32,091
My brother was diagnosed with PTSD.

978
01:01:32,091 --> 01:01:34,930
Si Joon's PTSD is just as bad.

979
01:01:34,930 --> 01:01:37,000
There's a fire! Fire! It's burning!

980
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:39,000
Why do you keep smiling?

981
01:01:39,371 --> 01:01:41,740
You shouldn't commit fraud with your friendly face.

982
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:43,401
What? Fraud?

983
01:01:43,740 --> 01:01:45,910
We can't just kick people out like this.

984
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:48,510
Do you have special feelings for Woo Joo?

985
01:01:48,510 --> 01:01:51,781
Woo Joo was different from other patients from the start.

986
01:01:52,851 --> 01:01:54,980
Why do you make your life so hard?
