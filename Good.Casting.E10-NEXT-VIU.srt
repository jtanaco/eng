1
00:00:05,837 --> 00:00:07,766
(This drama is fictitious...)

2
00:00:07,766 --> 00:00:09,877
(and all characters, events, organizations, and settings...)

3
00:00:09,877 --> 00:00:12,000
(are unrelated to real life.)

4
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:21,699
(Wash and Clean)

5
00:00:36,419 --> 00:00:39,320
I'm sure she went this way.

6
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:41,820
Darn it.

7
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:44,760
Didn't you get the message that our mission is over?

8
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:47,360
I got it too.

9
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,400
Then what? Should we lose Michael again...

10
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,770
and just let things go like we did three years ago?

11
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:57,069
What are you afraid of?

12
00:00:57,169 --> 00:00:58,940
You and I both.

13
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:01,569
We're employees before we're agents.

14
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:03,709
Did you forget yelling "command and discipline"...

15
00:01:03,709 --> 00:01:05,449
thousands of times when we were in training?

16
00:01:05,449 --> 00:01:06,980
You're afraid you'll lose your job.

17
00:01:09,849 --> 00:01:10,879
You too?

18
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,550
You know that...

19
00:01:13,749 --> 00:01:15,349
I have a kid to support.

20
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:19,390
You wouldn't know because you're single,

21
00:01:19,729 --> 00:01:23,060
but I have loans, interest, and tuition fees to pay next month.

22
00:01:23,229 --> 00:01:25,099
This is my livelihood.

23
00:01:25,099 --> 00:01:27,830
I can't just jump into something without weighing things out.

24
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:33,509
Even if,

25
00:01:35,209 --> 00:01:36,580
just this once,

26
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,080
I beg for your help?

27
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,550
My goodness.

28
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:45,819
You know...

29
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:48,149
how important...

30
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,989
this job is to me.

31
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:08,410
Oh, my goodness.

32
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:10,239
Darn it.

33
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,009
Hide. It's my husband.

34
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,250
Oh, my gosh.

35
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,349
- Shoot. What now? - What now?

36
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:22,959
Why can't I see a thing?

37
00:02:24,219 --> 00:02:25,689
Darn.

38
00:02:26,429 --> 00:02:27,659
What...

39
00:02:33,929 --> 00:02:34,929
So,

40
00:02:35,899 --> 00:02:37,040
what's your plan?

41
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,170
Talk fast.

42
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:50,480
My goodness.

43
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,350
Wait. That truck...

44
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:54,249
What are you doing?

45
00:02:55,989 --> 00:03:00,360
I woke up and you weren't in bed.

46
00:03:00,559 --> 00:03:01,589
Anyway,

47
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,300
why are you out here at this hour?

48
00:03:06,869 --> 00:03:10,100
I told you to throw this out and you never did.

49
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,869
I just couldn't stand the smell.

50
00:03:12,869 --> 00:03:14,369
If I don't throw it out,

51
00:03:14,369 --> 00:03:17,439
you just live with the trash, don't you?

52
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,779
Is it your lover?

53
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,380
I wish you'd hold me that lovingly.

54
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:25,179
My gosh, poor me.

55
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:29,320
I'm just a poor woman with rotten luck.

56
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:35,260
My goodness.

57
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:38,899

(Lim Ye Eun)

60

(Lim Ye Eun and Kwon Min Seok were in a relationship.)

61
00:03:52,809 --> 00:03:55,649
(Kwon Min Seok died the day their daughter was born.)

62
00:03:55,649 --> 00:03:56,950
Kwon Min Seok?

63
00:04:29,419 --> 00:04:30,820
Agent Baek...

64
00:04:32,719 --> 00:04:33,789
will steal...

65
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,560
the ledger tomorrow.

66
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:47,630
(Good Casting)

67
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:48,770
(Il Kwang Hitech)

68
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:50,339
(Episode 10)

69
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,909
(Director Myeong Gye Cheol)

70
00:05:15,159 --> 00:05:18,630
(Kang Woo Won's Manager Found Dead in Hospital)

71
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,209
You'll steal what's in Director Myeong's office?

72
00:05:26,209 --> 00:05:27,240
Yes.

73
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:28,669
Are you in your right mind?

74
00:05:28,669 --> 00:05:30,940
I am completely sane.

75
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,010
Look.

76
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:33,609
My pupils are the same size,

77
00:05:33,609 --> 00:05:36,380
and the temperature between my eyebrows and nose are stable.

78
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,779
My brainwaves are 100-percent normal too.

79
00:05:38,779 --> 00:05:40,820
It's against the rules to not return to base.

80
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,959
If we're caught doing something in the field,

81
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:44,260
it's really over for us all.

82
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,690
I realized something when I lost Michael three years ago.

83
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:48,630
To catch that jerk,

84
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,859
I must put my life on the line to get a shooting chance.

85
00:05:50,859 --> 00:05:52,130
If this goes wrong,

86
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:54,229
we might never get another shot at getting him.

87
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:55,669
I don't need another shot.

88
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,870
Because I will get him this time.

89
00:06:05,849 --> 00:06:07,609
I have a problem.

90
00:06:07,609 --> 00:06:11,020
I can't log into the NIS network.

91
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:15,589
I have an even bigger problem.

92
00:06:15,589 --> 00:06:17,289
The mission was canceled as of yesterday.

93
00:06:17,289 --> 00:06:19,529
You must return all the equipment.

94
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,459
I returned everything.

95
00:06:21,789 --> 00:06:23,159
I don't have anything.

96
00:06:23,159 --> 00:06:25,200
I'd love to give you something, but I have nothing.

97
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,270
I can't give you what I don't have.

98
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:31,440
But...

99
00:06:38,779 --> 00:06:40,849
How did he find that?

100
00:06:46,419 --> 00:06:48,049
You're really thorough.

101
00:06:48,049 --> 00:06:49,459
My goodness.

102
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,770
This could've pricked you. You have skills, I must say.

103
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:01,870
I'm not stupid.

104
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,200
I stored it safely between my toes.

105
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:08,770
I don't think I can...

106
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,779
hack into the network.

107
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,580
He took all my equipment.

108
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:15,450
The probability of failure is over 50 percent.

109
00:07:15,649 --> 00:07:18,049
If it goes wrong, you don't just lose your agent status.

110
00:07:18,049 --> 00:07:20,719
You could become a criminal for which you'll go to prison.

111
00:07:20,849 --> 00:07:22,089
Are you okay with that?

112
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,729
Prison life suits me well. I can manage.

113
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:30,399
Even though the NIS could erase your whole life?

114
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:32,930
Chief Seo leaves or I leave.

115
00:07:33,469 --> 00:07:34,930
It's one or the other.

116
00:07:36,899 --> 00:07:37,899
Fine.

117
00:07:38,669 --> 00:07:41,409
It's one or the other, life or death.

118
00:07:42,409 --> 00:07:43,680
Let's do it!

119
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,760
A GPS tracker.

120
00:08:03,229 --> 00:08:04,630
I managed to hide this.

121
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,200
I'll steal Director Myeong's ledger tonight.

122
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:12,339
How will you get into his office?

123
00:08:12,339 --> 00:08:13,709
I already have a plan.

124
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,109
Is that really the only way?

125
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,109
If something goes wrong,

126
00:08:19,109 --> 00:08:21,479
you have nothing to do with it.

127
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:22,649
I can't do that.

128
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:25,549
- You know that. - You know...

129
00:08:25,779 --> 00:08:27,419
how I got where I am now.

130
00:08:28,219 --> 00:08:29,890
If it hadn't been for your father,

131
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:32,659
I'd have starved or died in the streets.

132
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:35,529
Don't bring up the past. It's not fun.

133
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:42,229
I was an orphan no one cared about.

134
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:43,700
He fed me, educated me,

135
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,370
even sent me abroad to study.

136
00:08:45,539 --> 00:08:47,970
He died before I even got a chance to repay him.

137
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:50,409
How am I to repay him now?

138
00:08:51,939 --> 00:08:53,850
You're doing well enough now.

139
00:08:55,449 --> 00:08:56,880
You paid him back.

140
00:08:58,179 --> 00:09:00,120
I will get it done tonight.

141
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:01,419
That's final.

142
00:09:09,189 --> 00:09:11,730
(Il Kwang Hitech)

143
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:15,429
(Wash and Clean)

144
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:18,899
It's impossible to access the NIS network,

145
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:19,970
so it'll be too risky to try and hack into it.

146
00:09:20,809 --> 00:09:22,880
The only tool we have is the GPS device...

147
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,579
that Mi Soon managed to keep.

148
00:09:25,179 --> 00:09:28,679
So we have no choice but to do it the traditional way.

149
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,220
"The traditional way"?

150
00:09:32,179 --> 00:09:33,250
It's what we used to do...

151
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,620
before you started working here.

152
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:38,020
It sounds fancy.

153
00:09:38,789 --> 00:09:40,960
But it's pretty much just manual labor.

154
00:09:42,659 --> 00:09:44,329
(But it's pretty much just manual labor.)

155
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:48,000
Can you escort Mr. Yoon to his meeting later?

156
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,199
- Pardon? - Why do you look so startled?

157
00:09:50,199 --> 00:09:51,439
It's not like I'm asking you to work overtime.

158
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,840
You're right.

159
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,740
Then I'll go...

160
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:58,939
and deliver this paperwork.

161
00:10:15,059 --> 00:10:16,230
I'm going in now.

162
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,279
Okay, get it done in three minutes.

163
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:39,890
Chan Mi, can you show me the ceiling?

164
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,329
I can see it clearly now.

165
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:50,130
Why isn't there anything there?

166
00:10:51,659 --> 00:10:54,329
Hurry up. We don't have time.

167
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:09,250
Is anyone there?

168
00:11:10,549 --> 00:11:12,990
Hello? Is no one outside?

169
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,360
Excuse me.

170
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:21,590
Hurry up. We have one minute left.

171
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:24,500
There should be a card or fingerprint scanning device.

172
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,699
If not that, there should at least be a biometrics camera.

173
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:31,699
But why can't I see anything?

174
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:34,909
My gosh.

175
00:11:35,409 --> 00:11:37,710
If you're unlucky, you might trigger an alarm.

176
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:42,409
My gosh, this is driving me crazy.

177
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:44,350
I'll get caught if I keep stalling.

178
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:45,449
I'm just going to leave.

179
00:11:45,949 --> 00:11:48,020
Wait. I think I found it.

180
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:52,890
You recorded everything, right?

181
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:55,460
I'm going to leave now. Check the footage and let me know.

182
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:17,120
Hello.

183
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:19,350
Mr. Yoon signed the personnel evaluation results.

184
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:21,720
So I dropped by to give this to you.

185
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,990
You should've called. I would've picked it up myself.

186
00:12:25,189 --> 00:12:26,630
Then I would've been able to meet Mr. Yoon.

187
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:31,329
Have a good one.

188
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,039
It's a beacon sensor.

189
00:12:38,539 --> 00:12:40,539
"A beacon sensor"? What's that?

190
00:12:41,309 --> 00:12:43,710
It's a security system that uses a device...

191
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:47,049
to send a bluetooth signal to open the door.

192
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,409
But Director Myeong doesn't have a smartphone.

193
00:12:49,409 --> 00:12:50,679
He has nothing to connect the signal with.

194
00:12:52,179 --> 00:12:54,890
As soon as the secretary came into the room,

195
00:12:55,189 --> 00:12:58,360
the device on the door suddenly turned green.

196
00:12:58,659 --> 00:13:01,929
I think that means she has something that has a sensor inside.

197
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,500
"A sensor"?

198
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,799
(No earrings)

199
00:13:08,029 --> 00:13:09,029
(Accessory)

200
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:12,069
Zoom in on this.

201
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,610
It looks a bit different compared to mine.

202
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:21,649
Don't you see something shiny inside?

203
00:13:22,179 --> 00:13:24,350
- Yes. - By the looks of it sparkling,

204
00:13:24,549 --> 00:13:26,789
I'm pretty sure that's a beacon sensor.

205
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,860
Okay, that means we just need that badge.

206
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,419
No, wait.

207
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:37,799
The device needs to turn red in order for the door to open.

208
00:13:38,059 --> 00:13:39,829
But it's still green.

209
00:13:40,169 --> 00:13:41,270
So I think that means...

210
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,569
there's a set time to when you can enter.

211
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,240
What?

212
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:49,510
Then it will be useless to steal that badge.

213
00:13:50,939 --> 00:13:51,980
Gosh.

214
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:54,880
That means we need to steal Director Myeong's sensor...

215
00:13:55,149 --> 00:13:57,319
since that one has full access to that room.

216
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,689
Gosh, that's going to take some work.

217
00:14:03,189 --> 00:14:04,590
The door will open...

218
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:06,689
as long as you have the beacon sensor,

219
00:14:06,689 --> 00:14:08,159
and it's easy to duplicate.

220
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:11,559
So Director Myeong will always have it with him.

221
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:12,899
You need to find out what that is.

222
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:14,100
(Accessory 1: Tie pin)

223
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,000
(Accessory 2: Badge)

224
00:14:16,069 --> 00:14:17,600
He has five accessories in total.

225
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,669
A tie pin, two cufflinks,

226
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:20,840
a badge, and a ring.

227
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:23,640
"Five"?

228
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:27,409
He's a guy, but he wears more accessories than me.

229
00:14:29,449 --> 00:14:32,149
(Il Kwang Hitech NAND Flash Construction Site)

230
00:14:32,149 --> 00:14:34,120
As soon as we start producing...

231
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,520
the 176-layer 4D NAND Flash,

232
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:38,419
we're going to add two more production lines...

233
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,689
to meet the increased volume of orders.

234
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:43,299
And that will be here and here.

235
00:14:46,059 --> 00:14:47,130
It's not the badge.

236
00:14:55,809 --> 00:14:56,909
What is this?

237
00:14:57,039 --> 00:14:58,179
I'm sorry.

238
00:15:00,309 --> 00:15:02,350
- Are you okay? - Yes.

239
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:08,549
The cufflinks aren't it.

240
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:12,120
Sir, take this.

241
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,289
Oh, thank you.

242
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:19,699
Did you make this yourself?

243
00:15:20,299 --> 00:15:22,370
I'm very dexterous.

244
00:15:24,069 --> 00:15:26,039
- Where is the bathroom? - It's over there, sir.

245
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:29,539
I'll have it washed and returned to you.

246
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:32,110
- You can just give it to me now. - No, it's okay.

247
00:15:33,079 --> 00:15:34,779
Sir, I need to go to the bathroom.

248
00:15:34,779 --> 00:15:35,880
Okay.

249
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:50,899
It's not the ring.

250
00:15:51,429 --> 00:15:53,000
The only one left is the tie pin.

251
00:16:03,179 --> 00:16:05,240
The representative from Il Kwang Distribution will be your guide.

252
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,809
- It's nice to meet you. - Same here, sir.

253
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,149
You're very handsome, sir.

254
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:14,620
Did you say "Il Kwang"?

255
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:24,500
You scumbag!

256
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,329
I'm going to find another woman and live a good life.

257

(Congratulations on returning to the field)

259
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:39,779
Hello.

260
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:44,020
I'm Mr. Yoon's secretary. My name is Baek...

261
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:49,220
Excuse me... Secretary Baek?

262
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,789
Well then, follow me.

263
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:55,460
Let's go.

264
00:17:01,299 --> 00:17:02,500
Come this way, Ms. Baek.

265
00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:06,370
Of all the affiliates,

266
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:08,409
why did it have to be here?

267
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:10,210
Why? Why?

268
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:20,819
Let's not stand out. Let's just naturally...

269
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,319
disappear.

270
00:17:22,789 --> 00:17:24,490
I can do it. I can do it.

271
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:25,589
Ms. Baek?

272
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:27,559
Ms. Baek.

273
00:17:32,859 --> 00:17:36,000
I have something to ask you.

274
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,700
What's that?

275
00:17:40,839 --> 00:17:43,039
I've always respected Mr. Yoon,

276
00:17:43,109 --> 00:17:44,839
and I'd like to eat lunch with him.

277
00:17:45,379 --> 00:17:46,510
What?

278
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,680
Why are you so startled?

279
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,889
(Safety Passage)

280
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:11,470
Okay, I think that's enough inspection for today.

281
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,470
Let's call it a day.

282
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:15,670
Yes, that's a great idea.

283
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:16,779
To be honest,

284
00:18:17,539 --> 00:18:19,849
we'd love to eat lunch with you!

285
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,710
What a lunatic.

286
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:27,520
- Mr. Yoon! - Mr. Yoon!

287
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,990
- Mr. Yoon! - Mr. Yoon!

288
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:30,420
- Mr. Yoon! - Mr. Yoon!

289

Ladies!

290
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,559
We asked Mr. Yoon to join us for lunch today.

291
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:37,760
So please make sure...

292
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,559
you cook him a nice meal!

293
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,039
Thank you.

294
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:47,710
I've always wanted to enjoy a meal with you all.

295
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:51,710
And thanks to Mr. Woo, I finally get to do so.

296
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:52,779
And I'm very glad.

297
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:55,279
The NAND Flash is going to be a huge project for the company,

298
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:56,920
so I hope you all do your best...

299
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:59,279
in making sure the construction goes well.

300
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,420
A round of applause!

301
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:10,960
You should eat.

302
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:15,869
I have a cold.

303
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:17,569
I don't have an appetite.

304
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:21,940
You followed me out here when you're not feeling well?

305
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,740
What's Mr. Byun doing...

306
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:27,609
that he'd send a rookie secretary on an official trip?

307
00:19:28,109 --> 00:19:31,150
He should know better than that.

She's an outside hire who comes once a week.

311
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:10,420
Director Myeong hired her in person.

312
00:20:26,639 --> 00:20:29,910
Ms. Baek, it looks like you don't have an appetite.

313
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:31,910
Shall I get you some scorched rice in water?

314
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:37,650
Mr. Woo. Don't you have a girlfriend?

315
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:40,990
I can tell right away that you have lots of lady friends.

316

Don't you even go there.

317
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:46,990
Mr. Woo has such rotten luck with women.

318
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:50,799
Actually, not long ago, I went on a blind date.

319
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:54,599
Oh, dear. Are you okay?

320
00:20:54,599 --> 00:20:56,099
Here, drink some water.

321

Don't even talk about that.

322
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:00,670
The woman was a lunatic.

323
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:02,240
A psycho.

324
00:21:04,609 --> 00:21:05,639
What was she like?

325
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:06,910
Ever since that day,

326
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:10,779
I've been getting physical therapy.

00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:22,859
She was so crazy that she...

331
00:21:26,059 --> 00:21:27,099
Mr. Yoon.

332
00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:29,799
I think you should leave now.

333
00:21:29,799 --> 00:21:31,440
I can take my time.

334
00:21:33,809 --> 00:21:35,139

You have another appointment.

00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:41,279
I don't.

338
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:42,650
You do.

339
00:21:42,849 --> 00:21:46,819
I do have one very important appointment.

340
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,089
Right?

341
00:21:48,089 --> 00:21:50,289
So, about my blind date.

342
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,529
I'll hear about your blind date next time. Excuse me.

343
00:21:53,529 --> 00:21:55,589
- Let's go. - What? Next time when?

344
00:21:55,589 --> 00:21:56,960
- Goodbye. - Bye, sir.

345
00:22:14,879 --> 00:22:16,410
To the office, please.

346
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:18,720
No. I have to make a stop on the way.

347
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,420
Checking the factory site...

348
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,420
was your last agenda of the day.

349
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:27,059
My most important appointment is left.

350
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:28,789
Is it unofficial?

351
00:22:28,789 --> 00:22:30,160
You'll see when you get there.

352
00:22:31,329 --> 00:22:32,329
Okay.

353
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:47,049
Everyone is talking about the sudden death of...

354
00:22:47,049 --> 00:22:48,379
Kang Woo Won's manager.

355
00:22:48,379 --> 00:22:51,619
Videos of Kang Woo Won's escapades are flooding the internet,

356
00:22:51,619 --> 00:22:53,250
making people criticize his character.

357
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:56,049
People online and offline are making harsh comments.

358
00:22:56,049 --> 00:22:57,920
There's something I don't understand.

359
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,629
Why is it Kang Woo Won's fault that his manager killed himself?

360
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:01,760
It's because of...

361
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,760
messages the manager left on his social media page.

362
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,329
While he worked for Kang Woo Won,

363
00:23:06,329 --> 00:23:08,069
he wrote, "It's tough", "I want to die",

364
00:23:08,069 --> 00:23:09,069
"I want to leave the country."

365
00:23:09,069 --> 00:23:12,240
There was a long string of extreme messages.

366
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,240
He wanted to die because of Kang Woo Won...

367
00:23:28,549 --> 00:23:30,490
Jerks like you should die.

368
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:32,020
- Go ahead and die. - Die.

369
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,930
- Die. - Why won't you die?

370
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:35,289
- Die. - Just die.

371
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:37,000
- Die. - Die.

372
00:24:00,849 --> 00:24:02,619
Don't you just hate Kang Woo Won?

373
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:05,819
We barely got him to sign a contract and this happened.

374
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:07,889
Now the image of our rice cooker is lower than dirt.

375
00:24:07,889 --> 00:24:10,230
Aren't you glad it's not drunk driving or drugs?

376
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:12,930
It's worse than that. Someone died.

377
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:15,200
He lost the drama role,

378
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,200
and all his commercials were canceled.

379
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,940
Shouldn't we pull our commercials as well?

380
00:24:20,369 --> 00:24:22,069
The bosses will decide what to do.

381
00:24:22,069 --> 00:24:23,139
(Kang Woo Won)

382
00:24:24,809 --> 00:24:25,839
Hey, Lim.

383
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:28,349
Lim!

384
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:33,450
- Yes? - Your team leader called for you.

385
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:35,549
Will you keep your head screwed on?

386
00:24:35,549 --> 00:24:37,789
The atmosphere is rotten as it is.

387
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,559
Go to Kang Woo Won...

388
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:47,369
and make him sign the annulment.

389
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,440
The annulment of his contract?

390
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:53,200
And this is to notify him we're suing for breach of contract.

391
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,510
The commercial is popular,

392
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:58,210
and sales jumped quite a bit.

393
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,950
Do we have to annul it?

394
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:05,680
He must be going through a lot as it is.

395
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,250
We're not a charity...

396
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:10,359
that makes money to look after celebrities that cause trouble.

397
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,420
This is the perfect time to cut him loose.

398
00:25:12,789 --> 00:25:14,359
This is just the beginning.

399
00:25:14,889 --> 00:25:16,289
The beginning of what?

400
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:19,760
The beginning of Kang Woo Won's downfall.

401
00:25:20,059 --> 00:25:21,730
Kang Woo Won's downfall.

402
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:25,339
(Complaint)

403
00:25:26,639 --> 00:25:29,510
Do I have to go in person?

404
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:32,109
You can send it by registered mail.

405
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:34,079
It'll be a hassle if he refuses to take the package.

406
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,319
Take it to him and watch him sign it.

407
00:26:03,539 --> 00:26:04,609
Yes.

408
00:26:04,809 --> 00:26:06,910
This is what I wanted so much.

409
00:26:07,609 --> 00:26:09,950
I'll finally be free of him...

410
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:12,180
and can go back to my normal life.

411
00:26:17,289 --> 00:26:18,760
How can I tell him?

412
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,289
I can't do it.

413
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:21,829
Never.

414
00:26:34,369 --> 00:26:35,440
Poppy.

415
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:38,240
Why are you such a mess?

416
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:46,549
How long has he been stuck indoors?

417
00:27:08,339 --> 00:27:09,740
Woo Won.

418
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,180
Mr. Kang.

419
00:27:17,079 --> 00:27:19,379
(How to use a rice cooker)

420
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:22,990
I'll write down the instructions for you again.

421
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:25,389
You can't take back what you gave me.

422
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,460
But I'm the one who wrote it.

423
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:29,289
Taking things back is the worst.

424
00:27:29,289 --> 00:27:31,029
I'll write you another one!

425
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:39,839
(How to use a rice cooker)

426
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:55,750
Woo Won.

427
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:06,460
Woo Won. Mr. Kang!

428
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,270
Oh, no!

429
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:11,270
Yes, 911.

430
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,700
911. Call 911.

431
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:20,410
Are you all right?

432
00:28:20,609 --> 00:28:22,180
Don't make a fuss.

433
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:23,549
I'm not dying.

434
00:28:26,549 --> 00:28:28,020
Are you fully awake?

435
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:30,559
Are you sure you're okay?

436
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,520
I just took a few sleeping pills.

437
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:35,129
I just couldn't sleep.

438
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:41,529
It doesn't look like just a few.

439
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,069
Why are you here?

440
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:48,010
Well...

441
00:28:57,119 --> 00:28:58,750
It's nothing.

442
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,420
Do you think so too?

443
00:29:07,629 --> 00:29:08,690
About what?

444
00:29:09,059 --> 00:29:10,089
Pi Cheol Woong.

445
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,200
That he died because of me.

446
00:29:17,069 --> 00:29:18,200
No.

447
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,170
I don't think he died because of you.

448
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:21,770
No way.

449
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:24,680
Why?

450
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,049
Because...

451
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:33,319
it wasn't your fault.

452
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,720
It wasn't your fault.

453
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,059
He died because of us.

454
00:29:46,529 --> 00:29:47,599
I knew it.

455
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,470
I know you're just saying that out of pity.

456
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,240
Just go.

457
00:29:53,099 --> 00:29:54,240
Get lost.

458
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:14,200
So the urgent business...

459
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:18,609
Give it a shot. I'll coach you.

460
00:30:18,609 --> 00:30:21,109
That's all right. I'm good.

461
00:30:21,109 --> 00:30:23,279
It's difficult for everyone at first.

462
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,849
I couldn't hit the target properly either.

463
00:30:27,079 --> 00:30:29,049
Go on. I'll help you get the hang of it.

464
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:30,750
Go ahead.

465
00:30:31,319 --> 00:30:34,420
Stabilize the gun with one arm. Have the other arm push against it.

466
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:36,559
Keep your eyes open.

467
00:30:37,019 --> 00:30:38,160
Open your eyes.

468
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:45,170
What the...

469
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:54,309
You just hit the target. I see you're good at this.

470
00:31:05,019 --> 00:31:07,420
That's too bad. It was so close.

471
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,059
It's harder than it looks.

472
00:31:09,589 --> 00:31:11,529
Right. It isn't easy.

473
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:15,299
How many shots must I make...

474
00:31:15,299 --> 00:31:17,059
to win that big stuffed animal?

475
00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:18,670
It's impossible.

476
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,029
A smaller one...

477
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:23,839
can be won with 50 shots though.

478
00:31:24,069 --> 00:31:25,440
50 shots?

479
00:31:27,769 --> 00:31:28,779
That'll cost 50 dollars at least.

480
00:31:28,779 --> 00:31:31,180
You can then trade 50 of those...

481
00:31:31,349 --> 00:31:32,910
to one big stuffed animal.

482
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,920
So the place you stop by...

483
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,160
every time you're outside the office...

484
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,759
That was the hardest to win.

485
00:31:46,059 --> 00:31:47,160
It took me 100 shots.

486
00:31:47,589 --> 00:31:48,599
Or was it 150?

487
00:31:49,059 --> 00:31:50,430
150 shots.

488
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,380
I've won 30 small stuffed animals,

489
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:05,710
so I'll be trading them for a big one in no time.

490
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:08,920
Is that something you want to win?

491
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,589
Why else would I be collecting these?

492
00:32:14,289 --> 00:32:16,789
I stop by every time I think of my father.

493
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:18,690
Your father?

494
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:23,400
He used to take me hunting often when I was young.

495
00:32:24,029 --> 00:32:25,200
The hunt was never successful...

496
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:27,200
and we mostly ate at a restaurant afterward,

497
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:31,910
but he said I was too cowardly for a boy...

498
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:33,339
and that it wasn't a good quality.

499
00:32:34,779 --> 00:32:36,410
It's why he kept taking me.

500
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:40,750
Truth be told, I've always been fonder of...

501
00:32:41,319 --> 00:32:42,819
looking at things instead.

502
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:45,990
There's definitely a resemblance.

503
00:32:48,859 --> 00:32:50,259
I punch men too, you know.

504
00:32:52,289 --> 00:32:55,000
Your punches will probably only tickle.

505
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,259
My hands may be small,

506
00:32:57,259 --> 00:32:58,529
but they can really hurt.

507
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:04,200
Gosh. What are you doing?

508
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,710
My hands may be small, but they can really hurt.

509
00:33:07,069 --> 00:33:08,079
Stay still.

510
00:33:18,089 --> 00:33:19,150
What's wrong?

511
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:23,990
It's getting late.

512
00:33:25,529 --> 00:33:26,630
We should head back.

513
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:38,309
Did you look into his tie pin?

514
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:41,069
Myeong Gye Cheol has it on 24-7...

515
00:33:41,069 --> 00:33:42,480
which means it contains the sensor.

516
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,849
However,

517
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:47,480
it's a limited edition model from a luxury brand.

518
00:33:48,009 --> 00:33:50,150
Less than 100 of them were bought in Korea.

519
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:52,220
His name isn't on the consumer list...

520
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:53,819
Ye Eun got us.

521
00:33:53,819 --> 00:33:55,420
Can't we just make a duplicate?

522
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:57,519
You may not know this from only buying knock-offs,

523
00:33:57,559 --> 00:33:59,690
but designer brands release their products...

524
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:00,960
with serial numbers.

525
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,299
We can return it before he notices.

526
00:34:02,599 --> 00:34:04,099
The clock is ticking, so get us a duplicate.

527
00:34:04,099 --> 00:34:05,130
Right now?

528
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,769
The NIS only has...

529
00:34:06,769 --> 00:34:08,369
a few 3D printers available.

530
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,670
Let's say I managed to get to one undetected.

531
00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:12,910
Operating it...

532
00:34:12,910 --> 00:34:14,269
isn't a walk in the park.

533
00:34:14,269 --> 00:34:15,680
Get it to us before end of business hours.

534
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:16,910
Just hang up.

535
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:20,480
What the...

536
00:34:21,349 --> 00:34:23,619
They think whatever they ask of me is easy.

537
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:34,030
You're coming by often lately.

538
00:34:36,059 --> 00:34:37,130
Don't be like that.

539
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,900
I came to remind you...

540
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:40,800
of the promise you seem to have forgotten.

541
00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:46,510
- What promise? - I make you CEO...

542
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:48,809
and you fatten my dad's pockets in return.

543
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,639
It seemed to have slipped your mind.

544
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:51,710
I'm considering...

545
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:54,449
whether or not I should keep our deal.

546
00:34:54,849 --> 00:34:55,920
I don't know...

547
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:58,289
if it's worth it anymore.

548
00:35:04,059 --> 00:35:05,460
So you wanted to be CEO...

549
00:35:05,789 --> 00:35:07,730
not because it's what your father wanted...

550
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:11,059
but because you had an ulterior motive.

551
00:35:13,269 --> 00:35:14,329
An ulterior motive?

552
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,940
Only you know what goes on inside your head...

553
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:21,480
and why you changed your mind.

554
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:23,139
You're right about me changing my attitude.

555
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:26,079
I no longer wish to live...

556
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:27,579
suppressing my emotions.

557
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:29,349
Since when?

558
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:50,940
Keep acting out...

559
00:35:51,269 --> 00:35:53,070
and I'll sell my shares of the company.

560
00:35:54,539 --> 00:35:57,909
I wonder who'll benefit the most from them.

561
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:12,690
Are you hurt?

562
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,829
- I'm fine. - Leave it.

563
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:17,130
I'll clean it up myself. How clumsy of her.

564
00:36:18,199 --> 00:36:20,869
Sir, I'm grateful for your help,

565
00:36:21,739 --> 00:36:23,369
but you're making me uncomfortable.

566
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:28,440
Of course. I just can't seem to help myself.

567
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,780
I'll quickly have this cleaned up.

568
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:40,619
You seem jumpy...

569
00:36:42,019 --> 00:36:43,519
like someone who has something to hide.

570
00:36:44,659 --> 00:36:46,159
I thought you had left.

571
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,039
I see this is the sweet spot.

572
00:36:59,969 --> 00:37:02,480
Please let me know if I can help you with anything.

573
00:37:04,409 --> 00:37:05,550
Now I know...

574
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:07,880
why you sit here.

575
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:16,460
(You have a new message.)

576
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:21,329
Is that why you had someone follow me?

577
00:37:26,429 --> 00:37:27,469
(CEO Sim Hwa Ran)

578
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:33,639
Does Seok Ho know...

579
00:37:34,269 --> 00:37:35,539
your true identity?

580
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:41,250
You seem very interested in a nobody like me.

581
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:46,389
If I had known you weren't a nobody,

582
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:49,119
I would've had you removed ages ago.

583
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,440
(You have a new message.)

584
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,309
Package en route.

585
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:12,780
Then let's get to work.

586
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:35,039
The duplicate has no serial number on the back.

587
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:44,239
The target is here.

588
00:38:44,409 --> 00:38:45,480
Got it.

589
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:49,519
You are to wrap this up before he notices.

590
00:38:58,119 --> 00:39:00,730
My gosh, I'm so sorry!

591
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:02,400
Goodness gracious.

592
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,630
What are you doing with that dirty rag?

593
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:04,659
Get it off him.

594
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:07,170
I'm so sorry, sir.

595
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:08,230
Look where you're going, lady.

596
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:10,969
I apologize for knocking this off.

597
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,840
If you're done, get out of the way.

598
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,409
Sure, let me clean up...

599
00:39:40,869 --> 00:39:43,170
The new town is developing high-value land...

600
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:45,000
and we're offering...

601
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,039
our VVIP clients a chance to hear the offer first.

602
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:48,369
The investment will be worthwhile...

603
00:39:48,369 --> 00:39:49,409
I'm good.

604
00:40:12,329 --> 00:40:13,670
The serial number is...

605
00:40:16,699 --> 00:40:17,739
Wait, there isn't one.

606
00:40:21,469 --> 00:40:22,539
There's nothing here.

607
00:40:33,489 --> 00:40:35,820
Maybe I should've had random numbers carved in it.

608
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:41,360
Well, it's not like she can tell it's a knock-off.

609
00:40:44,099 --> 00:40:45,530
It's a knock-off.

610
00:40:46,269 --> 00:40:48,400
- A knock-off? - Yes.

611
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,800
Now I'm thinking that his cufflinks are knock-offs too.

612
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,440
I was worried about nothing.

613
00:40:52,909 --> 00:40:54,309
Unbelievable.

614
00:41:41,989 --> 00:41:43,789
That nutjob.

615
00:42:10,719 --> 00:42:11,849
What now?

616
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:15,920
Is it okay to keep taking late-night snacks from Mr. Byun?

617
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,760
He said he'll treat us again when he gets this month's salary.

618
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:19,760
- Again? - So enjoy.

619
00:42:19,929 --> 00:42:22,360
I'll buy next month, so eat up.

620
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,929
- Sure. - Enjoy.

621
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:27,599
Wait, what's up with the monitor?

622
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:29,570
What about the monitor?

623
00:42:30,739 --> 00:42:32,510
It's out again.

624
00:42:33,809 --> 00:42:35,110
(Emergency use only)

625
00:43:05,769 --> 00:43:07,809
So 10 minutes tops.

626
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,019
- What? - What's going on?

627
00:43:19,219 --> 00:43:20,590
The power must be out.

628
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:22,489
- Start the backup generators. - Yes, sir.

629
00:43:22,489 --> 00:43:23,820
- Hurry! - Got it.

630
00:43:26,789 --> 00:43:29,260
Okay, 10 minutes and counting down.

631

(Project Launch Expenses and Business Council Budget)

633
00:46:16,599 --> 00:46:17,960
The security team is here.

634
00:46:18,099 --> 00:46:19,670
Get out of there right now.

635
00:46:20,099 --> 00:46:21,469
Why is this door locked?

636
00:46:21,969 --> 00:46:24,300
- Can you get me the master key? - Sure.

637
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:27,739
What's taking you so long? Your 10 minutes is almost up.

638
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:54,769
Thanks.

639
00:46:58,969 --> 00:47:00,940
- The power's back. - What?

640
00:47:11,650 --> 00:47:12,719
Darn.

641
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:30,369
What are you doing in my office?

642
00:47:34,769 --> 00:47:36,010
Aren't you CEO Yoon's secretary?

643
00:47:49,019 --> 00:47:50,619
I found it suspicious too,

644
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:52,389
so I was about to report it.

645
00:47:54,590 --> 00:47:56,059
How did you get the door to open?

646
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:06,670
The knock-off tie clip wouldn't have worked.

647
00:48:09,739 --> 00:48:11,510
It's like I said, sir.

648
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:14,880
The door was open when I got here.

649
00:48:16,449 --> 00:48:19,550
It was a trap set up by the sly viper.

650
00:48:25,889 --> 00:48:27,960
Why hasn't Chan Mi gotten out of there?

651

I don't know.

652
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:32,329
Our call was disconnected.

653
00:48:36,099 --> 00:48:37,769
What were you doing in my office?

654
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:40,969
I dropped an important letter...

655
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:44,710
when I came by earlier today.

656
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:55,119
You sneaked in here like a street cat at this hour...

657
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:57,219
just to retrieve this letter?

658
00:48:58,219 --> 00:48:59,659
Am I supposed to believe that?

659
00:48:59,889 --> 00:49:02,300
I understand how misleading this may seem,

660
00:49:03,030 --> 00:49:04,059
but I'm telling you the truth.

661

"has brought good luck..."

"to its recipients all around the world."

664
00:49:21,550 --> 00:49:24,519
Is this some kind of joke to you?

665
00:49:28,650 --> 00:49:29,789
Check the security cameras.

666
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:32,889
I'm sorry, sir, but nothing was caught on camera...

667
00:49:33,590 --> 00:49:35,230
due to the blackout.

668
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:38,929
Frisk her.

669
00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:43,199
Don't just stand there and frisk her.

You are to check even what's in her hair.

00:49:52,210 --> 00:49:53,349
Go ahead.

672
00:49:54,710 --> 00:49:56,420
You can search everywhere...

673
00:49:57,750 --> 00:49:58,780
including my hair.

674
00:50:15,070 --> 00:50:16,670
(Project Launch Expenses and Business Council Budget)

675
00:50:16,670 --> 00:50:17,840
(Date, Name, Amount)

676
00:50:21,139 --> 00:50:23,110
(Sexual harassment in the workplace)

677
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:25,409
What on earth?

678
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:29,179
No! Darn it!

679
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:35,619
(54M 4393)

680
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:42,130
My secretary was caught snooping around your office?

681
00:50:46,099 --> 00:50:47,530
Yes, I'm afraid so.

682
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:49,199
So what'll it be?

683
00:50:49,769 --> 00:50:51,769
If you didn't know about this,

684
00:50:52,039 --> 00:50:53,670
I'll have the police handle it.

685
00:50:56,239 --> 00:50:58,039
If something goes wrong,

686
00:50:58,039 --> 00:51:00,480
you have nothing to do with it.

687
00:51:08,219 --> 00:51:09,320
Where are you right now?

688
00:51:13,389 --> 00:51:15,230
Your new secretary...

689
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,659
was caught in a cheeky act.

690
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,730
She wouldn't confess so I had no choice...

691
00:51:21,869 --> 00:51:23,639
but to call her boss.

692
00:51:28,170 --> 00:51:30,739
You found nothing after frisking her.

693
00:51:31,039 --> 00:51:33,250
Don't frame an innocent woman for something she didn't do...

694
00:51:33,679 --> 00:51:34,809
and let her go.

695
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:35,920
It's suspicious enough...

696
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:38,119
that the cameras were down during the time.

697
00:51:38,949 --> 00:51:41,820
You playing it dumb isn't helping anyone's case.

698
00:51:42,119 --> 00:51:43,960
Well, that's your problem.

699
00:51:45,159 --> 00:51:46,289
Meanwhile,

700
00:51:46,690 --> 00:51:48,360
I'm disgusted by the fact...

701
00:51:49,329 --> 00:51:50,699
that you're framing an innocent woman.

702
00:52:00,739 --> 00:52:02,539
If people find out...

703
00:52:02,539 --> 00:52:05,679
that the CEO's secretary was caught snooping around my office,

704
00:52:05,949 --> 00:52:07,710
you'll be the one in the hot seat.

705
00:52:09,079 --> 00:52:10,150
Do whatever you want.

706
00:52:13,690 --> 00:52:15,289
Is she legally at-fault?

707
00:52:15,449 --> 00:52:17,059
This is a new one for me too.

708
00:52:17,719 --> 00:52:19,760
Since she's only a temp,

709
00:52:19,829 --> 00:52:22,260
it could be better to let the police handle it.

710
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:23,630
No way.

711
00:52:24,460 --> 00:52:27,199
Then she'll only be charged with breaking and entering.

712
00:52:27,570 --> 00:52:29,900
It'll be better to report her to the NIS.

713
00:52:30,739 --> 00:52:32,099
You never know.

714
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:33,639
She could be a corporate spy.

715
00:52:38,510 --> 00:52:40,010
What do you think you're doing?

716
00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:52,489
The fact that she's not back...

717
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:54,530
can only mean she's in trouble.

718
00:52:54,530 --> 00:52:57,099
What if Chan Mi was caught?

719
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:58,730
What happens then?

720
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,300
This wasn't a sanctioned mission,

721
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:01,929
so disciplinary actions will be taken.

722
00:53:02,699 --> 00:53:03,940
The same goes for us too.

723
00:53:04,539 --> 00:53:06,110
We're lucky if it ends there.

724
00:53:06,539 --> 00:53:08,869
If the police get involved, the NIS will cut ties with us.

725
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:10,940
Our lives will be ruined.

726
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:15,949
You've got to be kidding me.

727
00:53:16,119 --> 00:53:19,550
It seems like you don't fully trust your secretary either.

728
00:53:21,389 --> 00:53:23,590
Nothing will happen if she's innocent.

729
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,190
You'd better watch what you say.

730
00:53:25,519 --> 00:53:28,030
We'll know once the truth comes out.

731
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:31,530
That's enough!

732
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:36,800
The one crossing the line and being irrational...

733
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,099
is you.

734
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:44,710
You see,

735
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:46,750
if that rat...

736
00:53:46,750 --> 00:53:49,619
was sent here to steal from us,

737
00:53:49,849 --> 00:53:52,119
I will make it my mission...

738
00:53:52,119 --> 00:53:53,750
to have it rot in jail.

739
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:56,360
You think I'm bluffing?

740
00:54:01,389 --> 00:54:03,829
I heard that you handpicked her.

741
00:54:06,070 --> 00:54:08,800
Don't tell me that you're somehow involved too.

742
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:44,039
I'm sorry,

743
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:45,969
sir.

744
00:54:48,110 --> 00:54:49,170
I told you...

745
00:54:50,739 --> 00:54:52,809
that I'd work with someone bad at the job...

746
00:54:53,309 --> 00:54:54,980
rather than someone I can't trust.

747
00:54:57,019 --> 00:54:58,880
I will accept whatever punishment...

748
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,250
you deem as necessary.

749
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:04,659
I don't give people second chances.

750
00:55:07,559 --> 00:55:08,659
You'll be the first.

751
00:55:17,539 --> 00:55:18,539
Goodnight.

752
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:36,420
(Wash and Clean)

753
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:38,820
Gosh.

754
00:55:39,190 --> 00:55:41,789
Hold on. How did you manage to get out of there?

755
00:55:41,789 --> 00:55:43,599
Director Myeong wouldn't have let you go easily.

756
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:44,800
I don't know...

757
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:47,630
how I got out of there either.

758
00:55:53,309 --> 00:55:54,510
What is it that you want?

759
00:55:55,369 --> 00:55:57,239
The rights to the NAND flash project.

760
00:55:57,679 --> 00:55:58,840
Hand it over.

761
00:56:03,179 --> 00:56:04,480
Take it.

762
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:08,090
I'll be leaving with my secretary.

763
00:56:36,579 --> 00:56:37,820
The lock requires a fingerprint.

764
00:56:40,219 --> 00:56:42,619
I dropped an important letter...

765
00:56:42,619 --> 00:56:44,889
when I came by earlier today.

766
00:56:47,230 --> 00:56:48,260
Where's the safe?

767
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:49,900
Under the table.

768
00:56:54,630 --> 00:56:56,170
Are you sure it requires a fingerprint?

769
00:56:56,170 --> 00:56:57,469
I checked the safe...

770
00:56:57,469 --> 00:56:59,909
just like you told me to. I'm sure.

771
00:56:59,909 --> 00:57:01,039
What a shame.

772
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:04,079
I could've peeled off his flesh if the lock required a vein scan...

773
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:07,110
and plucked his eyeballs out if it required...

774
00:57:07,110 --> 00:57:08,809
an iris scan.

775
00:57:09,550 --> 00:57:11,050
It'll be sunrise soon.

776
00:57:11,050 --> 00:57:12,550
We'll need a few hours to print his fingerprint,

777
00:57:12,550 --> 00:57:13,849
so let's hurry.

778
00:57:40,179 --> 00:57:42,179
Myeong Gye Cheol arrives at the office at 6 a.m. sharp.

779
00:57:42,179 --> 00:57:43,349
We have a tight window, so move fast.

780
00:57:44,349 --> 00:57:46,719
6 a.m.

781
00:57:49,219 --> 00:57:51,119
Easy-peasy.

782
00:57:55,090 --> 00:57:56,159
(Hope you get some rest.)

783
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:29,559
The man isn't even a second late.

784
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,400
Anyway, our guest has arrived.

785
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:12,969
You've got to be kidding me.

786
00:59:47,070 --> 00:59:48,710
Ta-da!

787
00:59:49,739 --> 00:59:52,010
What are you doing? Get out of there.

788
00:59:52,010 --> 00:59:53,010
Sure thing.

789
01:00:21,139 --> 01:00:22,139
Hold it.

790
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:06,719
(Good Casting)

791
01:01:06,889 --> 01:01:08,219
The chief is a traitor?

792
01:01:08,219 --> 01:01:10,519
I was only following up on an anonymous tip.

793
01:01:10,519 --> 01:01:12,920
I have a feeling that the chief could be Michael.

794
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:14,559
It'll be over once we obtain that video.

795
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:16,130
Do you have Director Myeong's ledger?

796
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:18,360
Are you sure you have the video of Michael?

797
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:19,969
I'll await your comeback.

798
01:01:19,969 --> 01:01:21,329
That darned ultra fine dust.

799
01:01:21,329 --> 01:01:24,400
That's because Baek Chan Mi is in league with Michael.

800
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:26,469
Are you the one who got Agent Kwon killed?

801
01:01:26,469 --> 01:01:27,469
Yes, it was my fault.

802
01:01:27,469 --> 01:01:28,539
Don't let emotions sway you.

803
01:01:28,539 --> 01:01:30,110
She trusted me and I took advantage of her trust.

804
01:01:30,110 --> 01:01:32,909
What's worse is that Chief Seo might only be a pawn.

805
01:01:32,909 --> 01:01:33,980
Baek Chan Mi?

806
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:41,119
(Epilogue)

807
01:01:44,519 --> 01:01:47,030
The treatments don't seem to be helping.

808
01:01:48,230 --> 01:01:51,659
You sometimes come across buildings like this in the field.

809
01:01:52,829 --> 01:01:55,699
Buildings erected where they shouldn't have been built on.

810
01:01:56,739 --> 01:01:58,769
The foundations were wrong to begin with.

811
01:01:58,940 --> 01:02:00,010
How do you solve that issue then?

812
01:02:00,739 --> 01:02:02,909
They must be torn down and built again.

813
01:02:03,679 --> 01:02:05,809
But it's different with people.

814
01:02:06,510 --> 01:02:10,519
It takes too darn long to repair the physical damages.

815
01:02:15,420 --> 01:02:17,289
How did you injure yourself again?

816
01:02:17,289 --> 01:02:18,789
- I was hit. - I was hit.

817
01:02:19,219 --> 01:02:20,289
Hold on.

818
01:02:21,190 --> 01:02:22,389
Both of you?

819
01:02:24,199 --> 01:02:27,300
This isn't an injury one sustains in a simple fistfight.

820
01:02:27,530 --> 01:02:30,039
Were you attacked by a mob?

821
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:31,570
No, it was 1-on-1.

822
01:02:37,510 --> 01:02:39,480
Your opponent must've been a professional.

823
01:02:40,210 --> 01:02:42,309
You have no idea.

824
01:02:45,650 --> 01:02:48,420
You made the first move, didn't you?

825
01:02:49,019 --> 01:02:51,789
You should be glad that this is the worst of it...

826
01:02:51,889 --> 01:02:54,530
since your opponent sounds like a big guy.

827
01:02:55,690 --> 01:02:57,230
Consider yourselves lucky.

828
01:02:58,500 --> 01:02:59,969
Anyway, this might hurt a bit.

829
01:03:05,070 --> 01:03:06,139
I shouldn't have...

830
01:03:06,710 --> 01:03:08,739
agreed to meet this person.

831
01:03:09,110 --> 01:03:10,139
I shouldn't have...

832
01:03:10,809 --> 01:03:13,309
gotten cocky.

833
01:03:13,650 --> 01:03:15,510
For some reason though,

834
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:17,949
I can't get her out of my head.

835
01:03:17,949 --> 01:03:20,050
Wait, "her"?

836
01:03:21,789 --> 01:03:23,420
Baek Chan Mi!
