<b>to overcome that hardship together and forgive each other.</b>

161
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,130
<b>You deserve to be congratulated.</b>

162
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,140
<b>So enjoy it, Ye Rim.</b>

163
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,710
<b>Thank you.</b>

164
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,170
<b>Thank you...</b>

165
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,380
<b>everyone.</b>

166
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,020
<b>Congrats on your return too.</b>

167
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,480
<b>I'm glad.</b>

168
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,290
<b>All that remains is for your lives to get easier.</b>

169
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,020
<b>Thanks for your concern everyone.</b>

170
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:56,390
<b>We'll be well, if not for any reason other than to make it up to you.</b>

171
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,230
<b>Joon Young agreed as well.</b>

172
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:03,770
<b>Let me know if I can help in any way.</b>

173
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,540
<b>You too, okay?</b>

174
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,870
<b>Excuse me for a minute.</b>

175
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,310
<b>Where are you going?</b>

176
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,010
<b>To the bathroom.</b>

177
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:31,230
<b>It's okay. It'll all be fine.</b>

178
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,670
<b>Have you heard from Tae Oh?</b>

179
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:39,670
<b>No, not at all.</b>

180
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,310
<b>I'm sure he left Gosan.</b>

181
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:45,640
<b>He wouldn't show up again.</b>

182
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:48,750
<b>True. No one has seen him.</b>

183
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,440
<b>What's the matter?</b>

184
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:20,180
<b>No. It's nothing.</b>

185
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:23,550
<b>The food here is great.</b>

186
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,480
<b>Order as much as you want.</b>

187
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:31,690
<b>Come on. Stop joking.</b>

188
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:36,190
<b>- Isn't this place delicious? - It is.</b>

189
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,800
<b>The three of us should get together soon.</b>

190
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,440
<b>All right. I'll invite you guys to my place soon.</b>

191
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,270
<b>That sounds good.</b>

192
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:50,070
<b>Joon Young, see you soon.</b>

193
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:52,110
<b>- Bye. - Bye.</b>

194
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,910
<b>The single lady is leaving first. Bye.</b>

195
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:55,650
<b>- Take care. - Bye.</b>

196
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:56,910
<b>Bye.</b>

197
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:00,920
<b>Should the rest of us go for another round?</b>

198
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,890
<b>The guests should know to leave now.</b>

199
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:04,220
<b>You two should enjoy some time on your own.</b>

200
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:05,960
<b>I had fun today.</b>

201
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,720
<b>- Let's meet again soon. - Okay.</b>

202
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,990
<b>Take care. You too, Joon Young.</b>

203
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:12,130
<b>Take care.</b>

204
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:18,840
<b>Get in. I'll drive you home.</b>

205
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:21,640
<b>Our place is close. We'll walk home.</b>

206
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:23,240
<b>See you next time, Dr. Kim.</b>

207
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:25,880
<b>Okay, then.</b>

208
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:28,040
<b>See you next time, Joon Young.</b>

209
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:29,980
<b>- Bye. - Bye.</b>

210
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,100
<b>- Shall we get going too? - Yes.</b>

211
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,610
<b>The air's so fresh.</b>

212
00:18:58,410 --> 00:18:59,540
<b>- Isn't it? - Yes.</b>

213
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:12,460
<b>What is it?</b>

214
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,230
<b>No, it's nothing.</b>

215
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:18,300
<b>Let's go.</b>

216
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:24,000
<b>Tonight's dinner was so nice. Thank you.</b>

217
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:32,180
<b>I never imagined I'd be able to walk with you like this again.</b>

218
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,350
<b>I thought it would just end there.</b>

219
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:46,490
<b>The weather's nice today.</b>

220
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:50,090
<b>Without you,</b>

221
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,560
<b>I would've lived a broken life.</b>

222
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,100
<b>You're my savior.</b>

223
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:05,380
<b>You saved me.</b>

224
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,580
<b>I won't ever let go of these hands again.</b>

225
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,320
<b>Don't make it a huge deal. No one saved anyone.</b>

226
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:19,790
<b>One is responsible for saving their own life.</b>

227
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,090
<b>I only realized...</b>

228
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:25,930
<b>after you disappeared too.</b>

229
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,030
<b>I found out I love you a lot.</b>

230
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,900
<b>That's why I want to try it.</b>

231
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:38,040
<b>They say you regret it whether you get married or not.</b>

232
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:42,110
<b>Since I already did it once, why not try it twice?</b>

233
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,980
<b>My wife is so cool.</b>

234
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:57,830
<b>I think Dr. Kim is a good guy.</b>

235
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,900
<b>It looks like he's interested in Sun Woo.</b>

236
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,740
<b>Actually, I think I saw Tae Oh recently.</b>

237
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,440
<b>What?</b>

238
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:11,440
<b>It was only in passing so I'm not sure.</b>

239
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,840
<b>That's why I thought it'd be better for them to not know...</b>

240
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,050
<b>than to get worried about it.</b>

241
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:18,250
<b>Perhaps I should've told them.</b>

242
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,350
<b>I'm not sure.</b>

243
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,010
<b>What is it?</b>

244
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:45,740
<b>It's nothing. Let's hurry and go inside.</b>

245
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:57,750
<b>- Sleep tight, Joon Young. - I will.</b>

246
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:50,060
<b>I'm late, I'm late. I'm so late.</b>

247
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:51,960
<b>- Honey! - Yes?</b>

248
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,970
<b>Coffee. Take your coffee.</b>

249
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:58,420
<b>- Thank you. - It's hot, so be careful.</b>

250
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:01,590
<b>I'll be back.</b>

251
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:03,500
<b>- Drive safe. - Okay.</b>

252
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:54,350
<b>Joon Young.</b>

253
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,280
<b>Hello.</b>

254
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,290
<b>I'll get going.</b>

255
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:10,030
<b>Why did you come? I can walk home.</b>

256
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,000
<b>Why did No Eul leave?</b>

257
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,600
<b>I was going to buy you guys some tteokbokki.</b>

258
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:16,370
<b>It's okay.</b>

259
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:27,780
<b>What is it?</b>

260
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:31,420
<b>What?</b>

261
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:40,460
<b>Gosh.</b>

262
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:59,210
<b>You should let me drive you for the next little while.</b>

263
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:01,680
<b>I don't think you have to worry anymore.</b>

264
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:04,150
<b>I'm just bored staying at home all day.</b>

265
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:06,290
<b>All right.</b>

266
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,340
<b>I have to go to the washroom.</b>

267
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,420
<b>Mom.</b>

268
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,020
<b>Yes?</b>

269
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:23,660
<b>Don't ever call him.</b>

270
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:26,700
<b>Don't try to find out where he is or what's going on with him.</b>

271
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,500
<b>Don't get swayed by this and just ignore him.</b>

272
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,970
<b>If he does this again, just report him to the cops.</b>

273
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:20,120
<b>A vow renewal?</b>

274
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:22,360
<b>We don't need to do that.</b>

275
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:24,060
<b>Wouldn't it be bothersome for you?</b>

276
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:33,130
<b>My gosh, I had absolutely nothing back then,</b>

277
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:35,500
<b>but I rushed things because I didn't want to lose you.</b>

278
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,500
<b>We didn't even get to have a proper wedding.</b>

279
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:41,570
<b>I bought this dress at the department store...</b>

280
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:43,840
<b>on a three-month installment plan. I bet it's still here somewhere.</b>

281
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:48,210
<b>Do you know I bought this veil from an online shopping mall?</b>

282
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:54,320
<b>That's exactly my point. Let's do another photoshoot.</b>

283
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,620
<b>I know you look pretty in anything,</b>

284
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:02,630
<b>but I've always wanted to get you a proper wedding dress.</b>

285
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,900
<b>- Should we do that? - Let's do it before it's too late.</b>

286
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,670
<b>It's not even that big of a deal.</b>

287
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,970
<b>We could've done it earlier. I don't understand why we didn't.</b>

288
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:18,540
<b>Then I'll have to get some skin care before we do the shoot.</b>

289
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:21,750
<b>You don't need to get skin care.</b>

290
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:31,620
<b>While we're on the subject, let's do a photoshoot every 10 years.</b>

291
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:36,860
<b>Joon Young is getting older every year.</b>

292
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:39,470
<b>So let's take photos...</b>

293
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:42,440
<b>of how we age together.</b>

294
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,100
<b>We should keep a record.</b>

295
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:49,010
<b>Every moment with you is precious.</b>

296
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,540
<b>Even after Joon Young gets married...</b>

297
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:54,010
<b>- and has children? - Of course.</b>

298
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:59,250
<b>I bet you'll be beautiful even when you're a grandma.</b>

299
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:04,660
<b>- What? - I guess...</b>

300
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:07,330
<b>I did a really good job of turning you into fine a man.</b>

301
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:08,890
<b>Are you serious?</b>

302
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,730
<b>Come here. How dare you treat your husband this way?</b>

303
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:47,260
<b>Sun Woo, we really enjoyed the meal.</b>

304
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,990
<b>I ate so much.</b>

305
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,100
<b>Why did you cook so much?</b>

306
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,030
<b>I didn't know I'd end up cooking this much.</b>

307
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,770
<b>Thank you for enjoying the food.</b>

308
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:56,840
<b>It's because she's bored all day.</b>

309
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:59,770
<b>She even asked if we should make our own kimchi.</b>

310
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:01,470
<b>Can you believe that?</b>

311
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:04,980
<b>I think I like doing housework.</b>

312
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:06,850
<b>Maybe I should just get a new job.</b>

313
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:10,150
<b>I should quickly make you work so you don't get another job.</b>

314
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:11,380
<b>Yes, please.</b>

315
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:13,820
<b>I'll be off now.</b>

316
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:15,890
<b>- Bye, Joon Young. - Goodnight, Joon Young.</b>

317
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,230
<b>Let's drink.</b>

318
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:22,160
<b>Okay, sure.</b>

319
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:26,300
<b>I'm really glad to see how bright he's become.</b>

320
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:29,740
<b>I think he has a girlfriend.</b>

321
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:32,300
<b>Really? That's so cute.</b>

322
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:33,840
<b>You must feel a bit sad.</b>

323
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:36,710
<b>I'm just glad he's doing okay.</b>

324
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:38,740
<b>I hope things stay this way.</b>

325
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:41,310
<b>I'm sure he'll be fine.</b>

326
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:44,880
<b>He has you as a mother, so there's nothing to worry about.</b>

327
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:48,350
<b>You just need to make sure you stay strong.</b>

328
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:49,690
<b>Yes, of course.</b>

329
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:51,460
<b>I actually have something to tell you, Sun Woo.</b>

330
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:56,400
<b>Je Hyuk told me that he thinks he saw Tae Oh a few days ago.</b>

331
00:31:57,730 --> 00:31:58,860
<b>Where?</b>

332
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,430
<b>At the bar Je Hyuk usually goes to near his office.</b>

333
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,870
<b>He wasn't completely sure when he told me,</b>

334
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:05,970
<b>but I thought you should know.</b>

335
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:08,070
<b>Tae Oh must be drinking every day.</b>

336
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:10,110
<b>Do you think he might end up ruining his life...</b>

337
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:12,310
<b>just like how his father did before he passed away?</b>

338
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:17,180
<b>Do you think he went there on purpose?</b>

339
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:20,990
<b>He used to go there often as well. That's probably why he was there.</b>

340
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:25,690
<b>He wouldn't have gone there to start a fight with Je Hyuk.</b>

341
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:28,590
<b>Yes, you're right. Plus, it might not have been him.</b>

342
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:31,000
<b>What matters is that he isn't in Gosan.</b>

343
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,500
<b>- Right? - Right.</b>

344
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,930
<b>Hey, don't let it bother you.</b>

345
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:37,540
<b>I'm sure he'll get by on his own.</b>

346
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:40,040
<b>But of course, it might take some time.</b>

347
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,510
<b>I hope so.</b>

348
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:43,980
<b>I really hope he gets to his senses and finally lives a decent life...</b>

349
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,710
<b>so that we'll never have to see each other again.</b>

350
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:56,190
<b>Trust me. You don't need to worry.</b>

351
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:02,290
<b>Hey, I need to go now.</b>

352
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,860
<b>Okay, I got it.</b>

353
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:07,030
<b>Okay, bye.</b>

354
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,500
<b>- Did you have fun? - Yes.</b>

355
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,340
<b>- Who was that? - A friend from college.</b>

356
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:20,280
<b>We weren't even that close, but he suddenly called me.</b>

357
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:30,360
<b>- Aren't you going to bed? - I'll sleep after I read a little.</b>

358
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,440
<b>Would you also like a glass?</b>

359
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:50,280
<b>Sure.</b>

360
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:55,510
<b>What are you reading?</b>

361
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:17,160
<b>Honey.</b>

362
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:40,650
<b>Why aren't you in bed?</b>

363
00:35:55,330 --> 00:35:56,800
<b>I thought I'd be okay.</b>

364
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,170
<b>It's all in the past.</b>

365
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:03,840
<b>And I know you'll never cheat on me again.</b>

366
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:06,910
<b>I do, but...</b>

367
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:11,520
<b>But the truth is,</b>

368
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,360
<b>I'm not okay.</b>

369
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,760
<b>It won't get better.</b>

370
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,600
<b>I keep suspecting you.</b>

371
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:30,940
<b>I'm nervous.</b>

372
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,840
<b>I try not to, but I keep thinking about it.</b>

373
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,120
<b>I just can't forgive you.</b>

374
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:53,460
<b>I wish I could hate you instead.</b>

375
00:36:56,730 --> 00:37:00,700
<b>Because I love you... Because I know I love you...</b>

376
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:06,640
<b>it kills me inside even more.</b>

377
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:14,750
<b>What if I keep doing this?</b>

378
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:18,720
<b>What if I can't forgive you,</b>

379
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:21,320
<b>can't let it go,</b>

380
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:27,460
<b>and keep tormenting you like this?</b>

381
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:03,400
<b>I said I'm fine.</b>

382
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:06,100
<b>You won't go out, right?</b>

383
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:08,600
<b>No. Don't worry. Just go.</b>

384
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:16,310
<b>If you want to hang out with a friend,</b>

385
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:17,840
<b>bring them over.</b>

386
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:21,350
<b>Stop worrying about me. Worry about yourself.</b>

387
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:23,350
<b>Are you going to be unemployed forever?</b>

388
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:28,450
<b>Don't worry and start working here again.</b>

389
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:30,790
<b>We left your office empty all along.</b>

390
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:33,660
<b>Stop making the director feel so anxious.</b>

391
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,630
<b>Thank you.</b>

392
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:41,830
<b>By the way, about Tae Oh...</b>

393
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,900
<b>I don't think he left for good.</b>

394
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:47,810
<b>Remember Woo Ho Sang?</b>

395
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:49,740
<b>My high school friend you met last time.</b>

396
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:52,510
<b>He told me he saw Tae Oh pretty recently.</b>

397
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:56,680
<b>- Where? - In Gosan.</b>

398
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,520
<b>He looked all haggard...</b>

399
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:02,450
<b>and was fighting a street bar owner for not having paid properly.</b>

400
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:07,190
<b>My friend felt bad for him, so he offered to pay instead.</b>

401
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:10,060
<b>But once he looked back, he was already gone.</b>

402
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:14,070
<b>When was that?</b>

403
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:18,140
<b>About a week ago.</b>

404
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:24,080
<b>Why don't you look for him?</b>

405
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,750
<b>I'm worried he might get himself in trouble.</b>

406
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:33,820
<b>Why should I? He's probably thinking clearer now.</b>

407
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:07,290
<b>Mom?</b>

408
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:10,290
<b>- Are you home? - Yes.</b>

409
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:12,990
<b>Is everything okay?</b>

410
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:14,960
<b>It is.</b>

411
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:16,860
<b>When are you coming home?</b>

412
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:20,770
<b>I'll stop by the grocery and head home.</b>

413
00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:22,600
<b>Okay.</b>

414
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:07,250
<b>Joon Young. I'm home.</b>

415
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:23,100
<b>Joon Young?</b>

416
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:27,230
<b>(Son)</b>

417
00:41:58,330 --> 00:42:01,000
<b>I'm taking Joon Young.</b>

418
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,680
<b>(Tae Oh)</b>

419
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:21,850
<b>The person you have reached is not available.</b>

420
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,930
<b>The person you have reached is not available.</b>

421
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:41,610
<b>(Tae Oh)</b>

422
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:07,130
<b>Tae Oh?</b>

423
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,240
<b>Sun Woo.</b>

424
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:17,980
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

425
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:22,650
<b>Did you take Joon Young?</b>

426
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:28,420
<b>Yes.</b>

427
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,160
<b>He's with me.</b>

428
00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:42,030
<b>Where are you?</b>

429
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:52,440
<b>I missed Joon Young.</b>

430
00:43:54,110 --> 00:43:55,810
<b>I wanted to be with him, that's why.</b>

431
00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:02,320
<b>That was all, Sun Woo.</b>

432
00:44:03,290 --> 00:44:04,360
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

433
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:07,130
<b>I know. I understand.</b>

434
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:11,630
<b>He's okay, right?</b>

435
00:44:15,970 --> 00:44:17,140
<b>Everything's okay, right?</b>

436
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:25,540
<b>I'll go to you.</b>

437
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:28,810
<b>Let's talk in person, okay?</b>

438
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:33,450
<b>Should we eat together?</b>

439
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:36,250
<b>Let's do that. Let's all eat together.</b>

440
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:38,760
<b>The three of us, with Joon Young. And we can talk.</b>

441
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:42,990
<b>Tae Oh.</b>

442
00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:45,630
<b>Are you there?</b>

443
00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:49,000
<b>Hello?</b>

444
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,340
<b>Will you...</b>

445
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:56,110
<b>really come see me?</b>

446
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:58,610
<b>Of course.</b>

447
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:01,280
<b>Definitely.</b>

448
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:06,590
<b>I'm sure Joon Young would like that too.</b>

449
00:45:09,390 --> 00:45:10,490
<b>He's...</b>

450
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,190
<b>with you, right?</b>

451
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:21,300
<b>I'll ask him.</b>

452
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:24,400
<b>Can you put him on the phone?</b>

453
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:33,210
<b>Hello?</b>

454
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:38,950
<b>Tae Oh?</b>

455
00:45:42,690 --> 00:45:43,760
<b>Tae Oh!</b>

456
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:29,740
<b>When I was your age,</b>

457
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:33,880
<b>my dad left home.</b>

458
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:40,220
<b>He never came back.</b>

459
00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:45,690
<b>Not until he died.</b>

460
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,760
<b>I didn't want you to turn out like me.</b>

461
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:57,170
<b>I wanted to keep you by my side.</b>

462
00:47:03,810 --> 00:47:04,910
<b>Because if we are apart,</b>

463
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:08,410
<b>you'd think that I abandoned you.</b>

464
00:47:10,110 --> 00:47:11,650
<b>I just couldn't do that...</b>

465
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:15,120
<b>because I never abandoned you. Not even for a moment.</b>

466
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:22,960
<b>That's all I wanted, Joon Young.</b>

467
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,050
<b>Are you okay?</b>

468
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:02,060
<b>He asked me to stay with him just for a little while.</b>

469
00:49:03,390 --> 00:49:05,430
<b>He wasn't sure what he'd do if he was by himself.</b>

470
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:08,330
<b>That's why I came with him.</b>

471
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:24,050
<b>There was something I had to tell him,</b>

<b>I didn't mean any harm.</b>

<b>Please don't misunderstand.</b>

00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:43,400
<b>Get in.</b>

476
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:45,870
<b>Mom.</b>

<b>We should go eat.</b>

478

<b>We said we would, right?</b>

479
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:05,680
<b>Did you drink?</b>

480
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:10,850
<b>Yes. A little.</b>

<b>Okay.</b>

00:52:40,710 --> 00:52:41,840
<b>How have you been doing?</b>

486
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:19,650
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

487
00:53:27,490 --> 00:53:28,820
<b>I saw you and Joon Young...</b>

488

<b>eating here...</b>

489
00:53:33,130 --> 00:53:34,260
<b>a few days ago.</b>

490
00:53:40,330 --> 00:53:42,270
<b>I should've been there too.</b>

491
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,240
<b>I should've been the one sitting next to you.</b>

492
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:49,610
<b>I should've been with...</b>

493
00:53:50,650 --> 00:53:52,180
<b>my family and my friends.</b>

494
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:55,350
<b>What's the point of saying that now?</b>

495
00:53:56,950 --> 00:53:58,420
<b>You're the one who ruined it all.</b>

496
00:53:59,850 --> 00:54:00,990
<b>Joon Young.</b>

497
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:04,560
<b>Why did you suggest to come here?</b>

498
00:54:05,430 --> 00:54:07,160
<b>Now I only feel more disgusted.</b>

499
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:10,870
<b>I think you should give Dad some time to get himself organized.</b>

500
00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:13,770
<b>That's the only way to start over again.</b>

501
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:16,600
<b>I mean that for all three of us.</b>

502
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:22,280
<b>Yes.</b>

503
00:54:24,410 --> 00:54:25,680
<b>Let's start over.</b>

504
00:54:26,310 --> 00:54:28,850
<b>Let's forget about all the mistakes we made so far.</b>

505
00:54:31,850 --> 00:54:34,490
<b>I'll forgive you, so you should forgive me too.</b>

506
00:54:38,730 --> 00:54:40,900
<b>- What? - Let's do it for Joon Young.</b>

507
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:44,170
<b>Let's do our best as Joon Young's parents.</b>

508
00:54:45,530 --> 00:54:46,870
<b>It'll be hard at first,</b>

509
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:51,240
<b>but he'll become stable if we all try hard.</b>

510
00:54:53,070 --> 00:54:54,840
<b>We can go back to how it used to be.</b>

511
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:59,780
<b>- No. - We'll become a family again.</b>

512
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:02,480
<b>You know it can't happen.</b>

513
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:03,920
<b>I even wrote a new script.</b>

514
00:55:04,190 --> 00:55:06,320
<b>I think I could even get someone to invest.</b>

515
00:55:07,150 --> 00:55:08,720
<b>If you don't what me to do that,</b>

516
00:55:09,490 --> 00:55:11,860
<b>I'll stop writing scripts and get a different job.</b>

517
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:15,630
<b>Let's yield for each other so we can have a better future.</b>

518
00:55:15,630 --> 00:55:17,700
<b>Stop. Stop it.</b>

519
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:23,870
<b>It's over, Tae Oh.</b>

520
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:25,940
<b>We're done.</b>

521
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:35,250
<b>Ever since we first met,</b>

522
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:38,420
<b>you were my everything.</b>

523
00:55:40,490 --> 00:55:42,020
<b>But I realized that way too late.</b>

524
00:55:43,690 --> 00:55:45,460
<b>Can you please take me back, Sun Woo?</b>

525
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:51,170
<b>I know you also want that. Isn't that why we're here?</b>

526
00:55:58,670 --> 00:56:01,540
<b>Is that what this is? You're going to take him back?</b>

527
00:56:01,710 --> 00:56:02,980
<b>No way.</b>

528
00:56:05,610 --> 00:56:07,010
<b>No, that's not what this is.</b>

529
00:56:08,180 --> 00:56:10,650
<b>You kept lingering around us instead of getting to your senses.</b>

530
00:56:10,650 --> 00:56:12,820
<b>And I figured you needed to stop living such an unstable life.</b>

531
00:56:14,290 --> 00:56:16,120
<b>So I'm giving you a chance to finally settle things...</b>

532
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:17,460
<b>in front of Joon Young.</b>

533
00:56:18,690 --> 00:56:20,760
<b>But you're even going to ruin this, too?</b>

534
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:25,600
<b>Tae Oh, you're unbelievable.</b>

535
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:29,940
<b>Is this really the best you can do?</b>

536
00:56:36,210 --> 00:56:39,480
<b>I have absolutely nothing left. I lost everything.</b>

537
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:43,620
<b>Please give me one more chance.</b>

538
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:50,390
<b>Isn't that what families do?</b>

539

<b>If you're going to keep doing this, just go and kill yourself.</b>

<b>I'll help you financially until you settle down.</b>

541

<b>I'm not here to beg you for money.</b>

542

<b>Don't make me look more pitiful.</b>

543
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:31,490
<b>This might be your last time seeing Joon Young.</b>

544

<b>Is this really how you want to end it?</b>

545
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:40,600
<b>You need to stop living so shamelessly...</b>

546

<b>for Joon Young's sake.</b>

547

<b>That's the last thing you can do...</b>

548

<b>that to forgive someone...</b>

659

<b>of thinking that I set the rules, judge, and take responsibility,</b>
