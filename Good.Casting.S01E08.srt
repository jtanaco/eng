Mr. Ok's cell phone got registered?

167
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,350
I'm still checking.

168
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:31,889
Wait a minute.
Her license got suspended?

169
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:34,196
Did she drive under the influence?

170
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,289
No, road rage.

171
00:13:37,929 --> 00:13:41,029
With that temper of hers,
I can already imagine what happened.

172
00:13:41,929 --> 00:13:44,505
A habitual DUI driver
committed a hit-and-run,

173
00:13:44,529 --> 00:13:46,899
so she followed that person
and drove her car into his.

174
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:50,940
The car practically destroyed
and they had to scrap it.

175
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:52,809
I wonder if the driver was okay.

176
00:13:53,409 --> 00:13:54,409
What?

177
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:56,850
Hey, isn't it time for lunch?

178
00:13:58,009 --> 00:13:59,249
(Lunch time: 12 p.m. to 1 p.m.)

179
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,190
I need a temporary driver's license.

180
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:07,159
There's still a minute left
before the clock hits 12, right?

181
00:14:17,529 --> 00:14:20,500
Why do you think I married
a fool like Yoon Seok Ho?

182
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:24,210
He always keeps his promises.

183
00:14:25,309 --> 00:14:27,985
He never even held my hand
because of the prenup we signed.

184
00:14:28,009 --> 00:14:29,586
(Record of transactions)

185
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:32,025
We agreed to live our own lives,
respect each other's privacy,

186
00:14:32,049 --> 00:14:33,720
and stay out of
each other's bedrooms.

187
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,649
But why won't he wire my money?

188
00:14:40,259 --> 00:14:41,460
He always kept his promises.

189
00:14:45,429 --> 00:14:47,189
I wonder if he has suddenly
changed his mind.

190
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:56,269
Look into their relationship.

191
00:14:56,909 --> 00:14:58,470
It'd be great if you find something.

192
00:15:01,309 --> 00:15:03,679
If you don't, then it'd be a relief.

193
00:15:09,419 --> 00:15:10,659
I'll sit in the passenger seat.

194
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:36,480
I feel bad that you have to drive
with an injured arm.

195
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:38,309
It's okay.

196
00:15:38,909 --> 00:15:40,350
Please slow down.

197
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:50,389
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

198
00:15:50,929 --> 00:15:54,299
Don't be too nervous.
Just take your time. It's okay.

199
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,875
It would've been more comfortable
for you to sit in the back.

200
00:15:59,899 --> 00:16:01,639
I prefer the passenger seat.

201
00:16:01,899 --> 00:16:05,870
But Mr. Byun always beats me to it.

202
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,519
Here.

203
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:20,196
The flight to Taipei
departing at 1:35 p.m., correct?

204
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,259
Yes.

205
00:16:32,299 --> 00:16:35,000
The receiver cannot be reached.
You will be directed to voicemail.

206
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:38,710
Does this old man have dementia
or something?

207
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:42,379
How could he forget
that I have a big mouth?

208
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:44,726
(Flight to Kuala Lumpur, 1:35 p.m.)

209
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:47,250
Why couldn't he just take
what I offered?

210
00:16:48,649 --> 00:16:51,750
Does he really need me
to explain everything?

211
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:39,099
My gosh.

212
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:41,200
Who's that jerk?

213
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,039
Darn it.

214
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,150
You're dead.

215
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:59,396
- Gosh.
- What are these punks up to?

216
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,890
What's wrong with you?

217
00:18:03,089 --> 00:18:06,136
Hey, you!
Watch where you're going, won't you?

218
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,700
- What a pig.
- How dare you...

219
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,345
Hey, roll down your window!

220
00:18:12,369 --> 00:18:13,815
You little punk!

221
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:15,140
This jerk...

222
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,039
What's up with them?

223
00:18:18,869 --> 00:18:19,869
Why?

224
00:18:20,509 --> 00:18:21,740
Is something wrong?

225
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:26,680
I think the drivers
got into a fight.

226
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:29,980
They shouldn't do that.

227
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,619
It seems dangerous.

228
00:18:33,019 --> 00:18:34,690
Change lanes and avoid them.

229
00:18:34,859 --> 00:18:36,890
I will do that.

230
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:42,829
I'm coming after you.

231
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,210
Seriously.

238

Sir.

239
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:53,000
Hold on tight.

240
00:19:53,299 --> 00:19:55,099
What? Why?

241
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,170
I'd like to speed up.

242
00:19:57,839 --> 00:19:58,839
Sure. Okay.

243
00:20:18,029 --> 00:20:19,589
What are you up to?

244
00:20:23,529 --> 00:20:25,099
You just wait.

245
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:27,170
What scumbags.

246
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,956
I'll stop by a service stop.

247
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,319
No problem.

248
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:04,740
The toilets are over there.

249
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:15,450
Run a license plate for me.

(54R 6103)

253
00:21:22,089 --> 00:21:23,220
Okay, I'm on it.

254
00:21:23,789 --> 00:21:25,906
Mr. Dong. If you mess up
with a temporary license,

255
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:27,835
does that get suspended
or canceled too?

256
00:21:27,859 --> 00:21:28,976
What do you mean?

257
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,876
I'm terribly worried about Chan Mi.

(Chinese Industrial Espionage)

259
00:21:37,809 --> 00:21:39,640
Who should I go after first?

260
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:42,680
Eenie, meenie, minie, moe.

261
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,009
Bingo.

262

2362. It's your lucky day.

263
00:22:01,299 --> 00:22:02,329
Why are you crying?

264
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,505
Where's your mom?

265
00:22:03,529 --> 00:22:05,230
Why are you here crying on your own?

266
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,740
Nice.

267
00:22:17,849 --> 00:22:19,849
Is she a ghost or what?

268
00:22:20,579 --> 00:22:21,650
Hi.

269
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:26,490
Who are you?

270
00:22:40,569 --> 00:22:41,670
Min Jae!

271
00:22:42,769 --> 00:22:44,416
Thank you so much.

272
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,339
I was so scared.

273
00:22:48,279 --> 00:22:50,980
Min Jae. You can stop crying now.

274
00:22:51,779 --> 00:22:55,549
A man must protect his loved ones.

275
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:58,589
It's silly to cry once they're gone.

276
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:02,095
I want to thank you.

277
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:03,906
Can I at least buy you some coffee?

278
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:05,259
No, it's fine.

279
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:07,630
It's really okay.

280
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:54,539
You can't take that.

281
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:58,309
That hurt...

(CEO Sim Hwa Ran)

283
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,025
Hello. What can I get you?

284
00:24:34,049 --> 00:24:35,896
- I'll take this.
- Okay.

285
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,019
Thank you.

286
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:55,170
Do you have a death wish,
you psycho?

287
00:24:58,039 --> 00:25:00,146
Wrong. I am a psycho,

288
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:01,686
but the one with a death wish...

289
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,755
is you, Mr. 9318,
who drives so erratically...

290
00:25:03,779 --> 00:25:06,025
when you're a criminal
out on probation.

291
00:25:06,049 --> 00:25:08,150
Who are you? Who sent you?

292
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,025
Who sent you?

293
00:25:10,049 --> 00:25:11,420
That's what I want to ask.

294
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,420
Who sent you?

295
00:25:16,289 --> 00:25:17,565
Do you want to...

296
00:25:17,589 --> 00:25:19,789
get beaten to a pulp
on this gloomy day?

297
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:23,259
Why you...

298
00:25:30,069 --> 00:25:32,716
You made the first move, didn't you?

299
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,579
No. Darn you.

300
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:40,896
What? Oh, no.

301
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,656
What... Why...

302
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,265
Why... Why...

303
00:25:44,289 --> 00:25:45,690
No!

304
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:47,390
What's going on?

305
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:51,829
Are you crazy?

306
00:25:53,559 --> 00:25:57,630
No. I'm not the crazy one. She is.

307
00:25:59,569 --> 00:26:02,015
I dropped a plastic bottle
by mistake,

308
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:03,886
and he slipped on it and fell.

309
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:05,240
That made him angry.

310
00:26:05,509 --> 00:26:06,640
Even so...

311
00:26:07,339 --> 00:26:10,210
Do you think I got this
because I fell over?

312
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:13,956
Hey, you. Let's check
the surveillance cameras.

313
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:16,119
Check the surveillance cameras!

314
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:20,426
Gosh.

315
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:23,666
You lured me to a spot
with no cameras and...

316
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:24,890
Let's just go.

317
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:27,136
What if he follows and hurts us?

318
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,160
Let's just go.

319

If I see you again,

320
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:32,829
you'd better be prepared.

321
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:38,285
- Watch your step.
- Go.

322

It's okay. You're safe now.

- What are you?

- What happened to the cast?
- It's fine.

325
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:47,819
- How could you...
- Let's just go.

326
00:26:50,619 --> 00:26:51,890
My gosh!

327
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,230
Okay.

328
00:27:01,259 --> 00:27:02,930
I'm still on their tail.

329
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:05,599
I mean, what is his problem?

330
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,869
Baek Chan Mi
isn't your average agent.

00:27:08,069 --> 00:27:09,640
Make sure you don't get caught.

332
00:27:10,039 --> 00:27:11,339
If you do get caught...

333
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:12,740
What should I do then?

334
00:27:14,109 --> 00:27:15,210
Deal with her quietly.

335
00:27:28,619 --> 00:27:29,789
My gosh.

336
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:35,559
I'm sorry.

337
00:27:36,859 --> 00:27:38,069
Thank you.

338
00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:00,890
(Death anniversary)

339
00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:11,430
(Kang Woo Won)

340
00:28:20,779 --> 00:28:22,186
If you don't pick up in 10 seconds,

341
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:24,210
I'll consider it
a breach of contract.

342
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,880
(Kang Woo Won)

343
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:33,226
Hello?

344
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:35,289
It's urgent,
so I want you here in an hour.

345
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,279
Hello, I know you're supposed
to start next week.

346
00:28:57,609 --> 00:29:01,549
But if you're free,
can you babysit today?

347
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,990
What's so urgent?

348
00:29:13,829 --> 00:29:14,900
What?

349
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,099
That over there.

350
00:29:20,299 --> 00:29:21,470
What about the rice cooker?

351
00:29:21,769 --> 00:29:24,539
I want to eat at home for a change,
but I don't know how to use it.

352
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:27,069
My manager always
did everything for me,

353
00:29:27,109 --> 00:29:28,269
so I've never used it before.

354
00:29:28,609 --> 00:29:29,609
Did you...

355
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:33,485
ask me to come all the way here
because of that rice cooker?

356
00:29:33,509 --> 00:29:35,149
I'm an advertisement model
for that brand.

357
00:29:35,349 --> 00:29:36,909
And you're the employee
of that company.

358
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:40,396
Did you forget that you have
to come running to me...

359
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:42,160
every time I call you?

360
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:43,765
Should I reset your memory?

361
00:29:43,789 --> 00:29:46,990
Based on Article 4, Clause 5,
I only need to assist you...

362
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:50,176
when we're shooting an advertisement
at the studio...

363
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,646
as a means to promote the product.

364
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:53,900
"Promote"? Just wait a second.

365
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,886
I promoted the product
on my social media page...

366
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:03,240
that has a million followers.

367
00:30:03,309 --> 00:30:04,380
So does that cover it?

368
00:30:08,049 --> 00:30:10,765
Cook a few side dishes
along with the rice.

369
00:30:10,789 --> 00:30:12,825
I don't expect you to cook
anything fancy.

370
00:30:12,849 --> 00:30:14,819
But I'll be nice enough
to have a few bites.

371
00:30:20,059 --> 00:30:22,299
By the way,
there's meat in the fridge.

372
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:43,356
- Hello?
- Nothing comes up for 6103,

373
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,220
no matter how hard I try.

374
00:30:45,319 --> 00:30:48,025
I checked the VIN, make,
and where it was registered.

375
00:30:48,049 --> 00:30:49,089
Is it under a fake name?

376
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:50,589
I don't think so.

377
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:52,290
There seems to be an owner
listed on file.

378
00:30:53,819 --> 00:30:55,130
Text me who it is.

379
00:30:57,059 --> 00:30:59,930
I've been getting
a lot of spam these days.

380
00:31:00,529 --> 00:31:01,545
It's really annoying.

381
00:31:01,569 --> 00:31:04,000
That's because
you keep letting them talk.

382
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,869
Block the number. Go ahead.

383
00:31:07,339 --> 00:31:08,369
Sure.

384
00:31:09,369 --> 00:31:11,809
The owner is a corporation,
but I think it's a paper company.

385
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,279
Should I dig some more?

386
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,480
Did they even send a text?

387
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:18,126
That's pretty relentless.

388
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:19,325
Here. Let me take care of it.

389
00:31:19,349 --> 00:31:21,549
It's best to just ignore them.

390
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,920
Of course.

391
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:27,259
Anyway, why are we here?

392
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:30,559
This is my father.

393
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:35,099
Your father...

394
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,569
passed away?

395
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:50,750
(15 years ago)

396
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:00,589
Gosh, it's pouring.

397
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:06,476
What are you doing here?

398
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:09,000
I waited but you never came.

399
00:32:09,569 --> 00:32:11,769
What can I do
when I wanted to see you?

400
00:32:15,109 --> 00:32:17,410
We'll run on the count of three.

401
00:32:18,509 --> 00:32:21,250
All right. 1, 2...

402
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:24,809
I came here to say goodbye.

403
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:28,410
You decided to study abroad?

404
00:33:28,609 --> 00:33:30,779
I stayed in Korea for my mom,

405
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,619
so nothing's keeping me here now.

406
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:38,420
I'm sorry for not even
bringing you a bouquet.

407
00:33:39,859 --> 00:33:41,930
I see you've already
had a change of heart.

408
00:33:42,029 --> 00:33:44,930
Don't be silly.
My heart doesn't change that easily.

409
00:33:46,029 --> 00:33:48,646
The funeral home
was filled with flowers,

410
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:50,110
so I think I want a break from them.

411
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:54,039
Just thinking about lilies
makes me want to throw up.

412
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:58,686
Seok Ho, that day, I...

413
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:01,450
Don't get caught in the rain.
You'll catch a cold.

414
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:10,920
Seok Ho, take the umbrella.
You're getting soaked.

415
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:12,220
Maybe some other day.

416
00:34:13,059 --> 00:34:17,460
When we meet again someday,
I'll give this back to you.

417
00:34:19,859 --> 00:34:21,299
You can give me the umbrella then.

418
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,289
This is why having sons
isn't worth it.

419
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:49,659
There was a vendor out front.

420
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,260
You were too embarrassed
to buy flowers, right?

421
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:58,469
Don't people...

422
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,800
usually buy lilies?

423
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:12,150
For some reason,
I'm not fond of lilies.

424
00:35:41,409 --> 00:35:43,780
He suddenly passed away
three years ago.

425
00:35:44,949 --> 00:35:46,320
Three days ago on this date?

426
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,420
That's when Min Seok died.

427
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:51,690
I still don't know why...

428
00:35:52,789 --> 00:35:56,760
he went to Busan alone that day
without his driver.

429
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:04,739
He went to Busan?

430
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,579
What on earth happened that day?

431
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,739
Wherever I go,

432
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:18,349
wherever I run, I'm being followed.

433
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:27,960
They won't give up.

434
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:29,666
Who are these people?

435
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:30,960
Dad!

436
00:36:32,099 --> 00:36:33,659
Get back inside right now.

437
00:36:41,369 --> 00:36:43,409
They eliminated the chairman,

438
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:45,409
so killing me would be easy.

439
00:36:48,449 --> 00:36:51,010
I heard that the chairman
was particularly fond of you.

440
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:54,449
Wait. Here you go.

441
00:36:54,849 --> 00:36:57,449
This photo was on
the chairman's desk.

442
00:37:20,139 --> 00:37:21,210
No...

443
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:24,650
This is all because of me.

444
00:37:33,289 --> 00:37:34,760
I promise you this.

445
00:37:34,929 --> 00:37:36,030
I won't...

446
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:39,400
tell a single soul.

447
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,340
The secret ledger.

448
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,469
A ledger?

449
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:51,940
This is all my fault.

450
00:37:52,409 --> 00:37:56,610
Are you saying that
the chairman kept a secret ledger?

451
00:38:01,719 --> 00:38:03,190
No, Chief Myeong has one.

452
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:05,320
Chief Myeong?

453
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:07,599
Do you mean
Director Myeong Gye Cheol?

454
00:38:08,429 --> 00:38:11,599
(Director Myeong Gye Cheol)

455
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,340
(Chief Tak)

456
00:38:21,769 --> 00:38:23,785
Greedy scumbags.

457
00:38:23,809 --> 00:38:27,440
They won't leave you alone
when money can be sniffed.

458
00:38:28,849 --> 00:38:30,809
They're never satisfied
with what they're given.

459
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:36,190
You might find something out...

460
00:38:37,019 --> 00:38:38,820
if you talk to his driver.

461
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,789
Well, he...

462
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,059
passed away two years ago.

463
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,070
He died?

464
00:38:50,769 --> 00:38:51,840
Get out.

465
00:38:53,369 --> 00:38:55,539
- Sir?
- Get out of my house.

466
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:57,409
Leave this instant.

467
00:38:57,909 --> 00:38:59,510
- But, sir...
- Get out.

468
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:02,050
- Sir!
- Leave!

469
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:05,856
- Get out.
- Sir, hold on a second.

470
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,219
Just a second. Wait.

471
00:39:51,699 --> 00:39:54,260
Don't open the door. Don't open it!

472
00:41:36,199 --> 00:41:37,369
Did someone die?

473
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:41,469
What on earth is this?

474
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:45,980
Is there something wrong?

475
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:50,110
Don't you know that
I need at least one meat dish?

476
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,595
The only...

477
00:41:54,619 --> 00:41:56,920
pork dish I eat
is stir-fried spicy pork.

478
00:41:58,420 --> 00:41:59,719
It's stir-fried spicy pork.

479
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,789
You've gotten better at this.

480
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,610
This drawing...

481
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:32,920
What's this?

482
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:34,296
That?

483
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,530
A sudden inspiration
motivated me to draw.

484
00:42:36,989 --> 00:42:39,805
What do you think?
The strokes seem genius, right?

485
00:42:39,829 --> 00:42:41,000
You know it's a work of art.

486
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:42,745
One's artistic ability...

487
00:42:42,769 --> 00:42:44,776
just can't be suppressed I guess.

488
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,345
I see the image when I'm eating,

489
00:42:46,369 --> 00:42:47,699
relieving myself,

490
00:42:48,139 --> 00:42:50,110
and even when I'm sleeping.

491
00:42:50,909 --> 00:42:54,179
So I decided to hold an exhibition.

492
00:42:56,309 --> 00:42:59,396
Drawings like this
will be viewed as valuable.

493
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:01,595
I believe that
it'll be better to have your work...

494
00:43:01,619 --> 00:43:03,425
be appraised by an expert...

495
00:43:03,449 --> 00:43:05,619
who knows what true art is.

496
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:10,590
You're not wrong.

497
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:13,436
Not everyone will realize its value.

498
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:16,405
I know someone
who set a milestone...

499
00:43:16,429 --> 00:43:19,070
in the world of contemporary art.

500
00:43:19,239 --> 00:43:20,239
Who?

501
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:27,380
What's this? Was it drawn by a kid?

502
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:32,956
Was this drawn by Kang Woo Won?

503
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:34,349
Yes, Mr. Dong.

504
00:43:36,389 --> 00:43:38,050
The master of contemporary art?

505
00:43:39,019 --> 00:43:40,059
Okay, got it.

506
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,465
May I ask for your opinion on it?

507
00:43:43,489 --> 00:43:45,936
Anyone can tell
it's Chan Mi and Mi Soon.

508
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,260
Right?

509
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,869
I completely agree with you.

510
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:56,710
Don't tell me that
Kang Woo Won's memories are back.

511
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,079
I don't know.

512
00:43:59,409 --> 00:44:03,179
What if his memories
are slowly coming back?

513
00:44:06,849 --> 00:44:08,356
Since I know there are no photos,

514
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:09,719
I won't sign the contract.

515
00:44:14,659 --> 00:44:16,429
Guys!

516
00:44:18,599 --> 00:44:20,535
You are to keep
your eyes on him from now on.

517
00:44:20,559 --> 00:44:22,175
If he regains his memories...

518
00:44:22,199 --> 00:44:24,000
and threatens to
sue Pi Cheol Woong...

519
00:44:24,199 --> 00:44:26,876
Would that make things
harder for us?

520
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:28,445
Just like what happened last time,

521
00:44:28,469 --> 00:44:30,515
the police could
take our only witness.

522
00:44:30,539 --> 00:44:32,186
That'll be the end of our operation.

523
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:33,539
But Mr. Dong,

524
00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:36,710
I might die before
Pi Cheol Woong does at this rate.

525
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:40,880
Can't someone else
watch Kang Woo Won instead?

526
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:45,519
What is it? What did he say?

527
00:44:46,059 --> 00:44:47,339
What did he think of my drawing?

528
00:44:49,130 --> 00:44:51,829
He can't say anything
before he sees it in person.

529
00:44:52,699 --> 00:44:55,469
Wait. What did you say
that his name was again?

530
00:44:56,369 --> 00:44:57,506
Why do you ask?

531
00:44:57,530 --> 00:44:59,570
He's a famous artist
that'll be handling my work.

532
00:44:59,769 --> 00:45:01,570
I should know who it is.

533
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:05,940
Well,

534
00:45:06,539 --> 00:45:09,409
this artist works under a pseudonym.

535
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:12,579
What was it again?

536
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:14,119
What's his last name.

537
00:45:15,489 --> 00:45:17,925
Dong. It's Dong something.

538
00:45:17,949 --> 00:45:18,960
Dong?

539
00:45:22,329 --> 00:45:25,829
Master of contemporary art,
surname Dong.

540
00:45:27,059 --> 00:45:28,776
(Known quotes)

541
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,240
(Everyone has
a Picasso within them.)

542
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:34,840
I did it.

543
00:45:35,539 --> 00:45:38,245
(Master of contemporary art,
surname Dong)

544
00:45:38,269 --> 00:45:39,840
(Dong Casso)

545
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:43,010
Dong Casso?

546
00:45:44,349 --> 00:45:47,449
Yes, I think that's it. Tonkatsu...

547
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:49,590
I mean Dong Casso.

548
00:46:00,329 --> 00:46:02,530
Good job, So Hui.

549
00:46:05,239 --> 00:46:06,300
Hello?

550
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:09,769
Yes. I see.

551
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:11,940
Yes, I've got the time.

552
00:46:13,639 --> 00:46:14,639
There.

553
00:46:16,449 --> 00:46:17,849
There you go.

554
00:46:25,659 --> 00:46:26,989
Daddy?

555
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:04,960
- My gosh.
- Goodness.

556
00:47:05,659 --> 00:47:07,559
Are you all right?

557
00:47:09,099 --> 00:47:10,869
I heard a thump. Are you okay?

558
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:12,900
I guess we have no choice.

559
00:47:13,739 --> 00:47:14,969
I'll drive us back.

560
00:47:16,909 --> 00:47:18,385
You have a driver's license?

561
00:47:18,409 --> 00:47:20,539
I'm even qualified
to drive a freight truck.

562
00:47:49,239 --> 00:47:52,710
Mr. Yoon,
your shoulders seem too tense.

563
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,909
Please don't talk to me.
I'm trying to focus.

564
00:47:58,079 --> 00:47:59,079
May I ask...

565
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:02,150
when you got your driver's license?

566
00:48:02,489 --> 00:48:03,590
When I was 20.

567
00:48:04,619 --> 00:48:08,559
Then you've been driving
for over 15 years.

568
00:48:09,230 --> 00:48:11,230
Why can't you pick up
the pace though?

569
00:48:11,789 --> 00:48:16,070
This is my first time
behind a wheel since then.

570
00:48:17,429 --> 00:48:19,769
Pull over. Pull over right now.

571
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:21,840
We're clear...

572
00:48:22,610 --> 00:48:23,670
Don't swerve!

573
00:48:24,039 --> 00:48:25,239
Don't swerve!

574
00:48:26,179 --> 00:48:27,510
Did you just talk down to me?

575
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:30,010
Don't look at me.
Keep your eyes on the road.

576
00:48:35,789 --> 00:48:37,626
- Make a right.
- A right.

577
00:48:37,650 --> 00:48:38,650
Make a right here.

578
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:45,730
Don't swerve like that.

579
00:49:14,090 --> 00:49:15,829
You are off course.

580
00:49:25,230 --> 00:49:26,476
Are you all right?

581
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:27,940
- Eyes on the road!
- Sure.

582
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:31,570
Please keep your eyes on the road.

583
00:49:34,210 --> 00:49:35,380
We're in Busan?

584
00:49:37,210 --> 00:49:40,579
(Busan)

585
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:42,349
Busan?

586
00:49:42,489 --> 00:49:43,590
Exactly.

587
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:45,659
We're in Busan?

588
00:49:46,489 --> 00:49:47,535
Busan is this way?

589
00:49:47,559 --> 00:49:48,889
- Eyes on the road.
- Of course.

590
00:49:51,690 --> 00:49:52,699
My gosh.

591
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,070
You're leaving already?

592
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:04,309
What do you mean? It's 9 p.m.

593
00:50:06,039 --> 00:50:07,809
When did my phone go off?

594
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:10,809
You need to show me
how to use the rice cooker.

595
00:50:12,679 --> 00:50:15,296
I thought you might need it...

596
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:16,889
for next time anyway,

597
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:19,260
so I wrote down
detailed instructions...

598
00:50:19,559 --> 00:50:21,690
and stuck the note on the fridge.

599
00:50:22,289 --> 00:50:23,289
Where?

600
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:26,429
Where is it? I don't see it.

601
00:50:29,269 --> 00:50:31,369
I stuck it on the fridge.

602
00:50:32,599 --> 00:50:34,070
It isn't here.

603
00:50:38,710 --> 00:50:40,480
But I stuck it on there.

604
00:50:42,210 --> 00:50:44,010
See for yourself.
There's nothing there.

605
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:52,719
Then read this instead.

606
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:55,135
I don't read due to
my compulsive reading disorder.

607
00:50:55,159 --> 00:50:57,230
Shouldn't your condition
make you want to read?

608
00:50:57,659 --> 00:50:59,829
I've been steering clear
from reading as a remedy.

609
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:03,099
How do you study your lines then?

610
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,900
I listen to the audio file
recorded by my manager.

611
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:09,510
Are you kidding me?

612
00:51:11,769 --> 00:51:12,809
Hold on.

613
00:51:14,010 --> 00:51:15,416
Did you just yell at me?

614
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:18,309
That's right. I'm angry at you.

615
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:21,650
You call me over whenever you want.

616
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:25,190
That's what today was about.
You were bored, so you called me...

617
00:51:25,519 --> 00:51:26,789
and had me cook for you.

618
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:28,936
I'm not your manager,

619
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,829
your housekeeper,
or your girlfriend.

620
00:51:31,159 --> 00:51:33,106
Why do you call me over
all the time...

621
00:51:33,130 --> 00:51:35,000
and order me around?

622
00:51:36,030 --> 00:51:38,300
I would've endured it
if it were any other day,

623
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:42,070
but today...

624
00:51:43,239 --> 00:51:44,869
Not today.

625
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:51,250
This isn't what
I should have been doing today.

626
00:51:53,219 --> 00:51:54,280
Understand?

627
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:39,300
I'm sorry, Min Seok.

628
00:52:43,530 --> 00:52:46,239
I wanted to cook
a decent meal for you.

629
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:52,679
There's no one else who would've.

630
00:52:58,909 --> 00:53:01,449
I should've
been there for you today.

631
00:53:02,250 --> 00:53:03,489
I'm so sorry.

632
00:53:07,019 --> 00:53:09,090
I'm sorry, Min Seok.

633
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:29,050
Gosh.

634
00:53:51,699 --> 00:53:53,769
We ended up driving to Busan Port,

635
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:55,940
but it's nice, right?

636
00:53:58,010 --> 00:53:59,679
Why did you offer to drive...

637
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,510
when you aren't good at it?

638
00:54:04,349 --> 00:54:05,610
I wanted to let you rest.

639
00:54:14,219 --> 00:54:15,360
Have you been here before?

640
00:54:17,829 --> 00:54:20,500
I haven't since my last trip
three years ago.

641
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:21,860
Why?

642
00:54:22,829 --> 00:54:24,069
Because it's too far from home?

643
00:54:29,469 --> 00:54:30,539
No.

644
00:54:31,570 --> 00:54:34,210
I wasn't brave enough
to come back here.

645
00:54:39,349 --> 00:54:41,825
Please stay here.
I'll go and buy an umbrella.

646
00:54:41,849 --> 00:54:44,219
No, you stay. I'll get it.

647
00:54:46,659 --> 00:54:49,590
Find shelter already.
You'll catch a cold in this rain.

648
00:56:06,699 --> 00:56:08,500
- Welcome.
- Hello.

649
00:56:09,139 --> 00:56:10,986
- I'll take this.
- Sure.

(54R 6103)

652
00:57:51,909 --> 00:57:55,155
There were too many jerks
tailing me today...

653
00:57:55,179 --> 00:57:57,050
that I almost forgot.

654
00:57:58,150 --> 00:58:00,949
It's good to finally meet you, 6103.

655
00:58:02,449 --> 00:58:03,489
Bring it!

656
00:59:59,170 --> 01:00:00,369
You're an agent?

657
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:03,309
All I've heard are rumors about you.

658
01:00:03,639 --> 01:00:06,710
I guess it's an honor
to finally meet you in person.

01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:30,469
Who sent you?

661
01:00:30,630 --> 01:00:32,469
We're both in a situation...

662
01:00:33,239 --> 01:00:35,369
where we need
to maintain our covers, right?

663
01:00:43,679 --> 01:00:45,409
(CEO Yoon Seok Ho)

664
01:00:54,090 --> 01:00:56,559
It's over. I won.

665
01:01:06,539 --> 01:01:08,000
The person you have called...

666
01:01:20,219 --> 01:01:21,780
(CEO Yoon Seok Ho)

667
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:08,199
(Epilogue)

668
01:02:13,199 --> 01:02:14,199
Goodness.

669
01:02:15,170 --> 01:02:16,210
Hello.

670
01:02:24,110 --> 01:02:26,820
So he's the master
of contemporary art?

671
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:29,179
- Yes, he's Dong Casso.
- Dong Casso.

672
01:02:29,380 --> 01:02:32,750
I hear that you've been adamant...

673
01:02:33,659 --> 01:02:35,236
about meeting me.

674
01:02:35,260 --> 01:02:37,305
I'm well aware
of your achievements, sir.

675
01:02:37,329 --> 01:02:39,066
You set a milestone...

676
01:02:39,090 --> 01:02:40,336
in the world of modern art.

677
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:42,869
Well, it's really nothing.

678
01:02:43,070 --> 01:02:46,670
However, I did change
how modern art is today.

679
01:02:46,940 --> 01:02:49,809
I was hoping for
your honest opinion of my work.

680
01:02:56,980 --> 01:02:59,719
Let me see. My gosh.

681
01:03:03,190 --> 01:03:04,820
How should I put this?

682
01:03:05,719 --> 01:03:08,195
This is more than
just post-modernism.

683
01:03:08,219 --> 01:03:09,635
I can detect...

684
01:03:09,659 --> 01:03:12,360
a major element of contemporary art.

685
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:15,276
The lines may be rough and simple,

686
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:18,006
but I can see an artist...

687
01:03:18,030 --> 01:03:19,715
taking a bold move...

688
01:03:19,739 --> 01:03:23,146
in trying to dismantle
the conventional structure of art.

689
01:03:23,170 --> 01:03:26,710
Goodness. I'm impressed.

690
01:03:27,510 --> 01:03:28,579
Thank you.

691
01:03:29,139 --> 01:03:31,026
How about a photo
of you two together?

692
01:03:31,050 --> 01:03:32,650
- Sure.
- Okay.

693
01:03:45,929 --> 01:03:47,706
(Good Casting)

694
01:03:47,730 --> 01:03:49,405
Pi Cheol Woong is dead?

695
01:03:49,429 --> 01:03:50,976
Pi Cheol Woong was murdered...

696
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,046
while the fire alarm was ringing.

697
01:03:52,070 --> 01:03:54,745
What if I told you that I had
a way to get rid of our problem?

698
01:03:54,769 --> 01:03:56,046
Team three will be dismantled.

699
01:03:56,070 --> 01:03:57,445
Is this what you wanted all along?

700
01:03:57,469 --> 01:03:59,285
- What's your issue this time?
- You had me tailed!

701
01:03:59,309 --> 01:04:00,686
Don't tell me
you're a double-agent.

702
01:04:00,710 --> 01:04:02,780
Hello? Ye Eun? Say something.

703
01:04:02,949 --> 01:04:04,686
I'm glad you weren't hurt.

704
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:05,687
I was worried, you know.

705
01:04:05,711 --> 01:04:06,726
I forgot something.

706
01:04:06,750 --> 01:04:07,956
- It's mine.
- But...

707
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:09,555
Why are you doing this to me?

708
01:04:09,579 --> 01:04:11,465
Isn't it Michael you want?
He's right beside you.

709
01:04:11,489 --> 01:04:12,590
What are you talking about?
