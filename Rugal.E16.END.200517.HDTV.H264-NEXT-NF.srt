00:00:00,016 --> 00:00:06,789
RUGAL

2
00:00:15,915 --> 00:00:18,543
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGION AND INCIDENTS

3
00:00:18,626 --> 00:00:20,837
PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

4
00:00:21,671 --> 00:00:22,505
EPISODE 16

5
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:23,923
Did you gather the test subjects?

6
00:00:24,632 --> 00:00:26,384
Or was Choi Geun-cheol behind that?

7
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:28,344
Han Tae-woong.

8
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,556
I thought only Kang Gi-beom
was the crazy bastard.

9
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:34,892
No wonder he locked you up as well.

10
00:00:41,858 --> 00:00:43,443
Just answer my question.

11
00:00:46,696 --> 00:00:48,990
Who's responsible? You or Choi Geun-cheol?

12
00:00:49,866 --> 00:00:51,534
Have you heard of competitive bidding?

13
00:00:51,826 --> 00:00:53,411
The people's safety is at stake.

14
00:00:54,203 --> 00:00:55,830
I ought to do my due diligence

15
00:00:55,913 --> 00:00:57,707
to choose the best investment
for the country.

16
00:00:58,499 --> 00:01:00,752
Surely, you'd understand
why I had to test it out.

17
00:01:02,295 --> 00:01:03,713
You guys are much more capable,

18
00:01:04,505 --> 00:01:05,840
but managing Rugal...

19
00:01:06,758 --> 00:01:09,093
At least, Hwang Deuk-gu's products

20
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:13,473
don't bite the hands that feed them.

21
00:01:14,307 --> 00:01:15,808
-"Products"?
-Han Tae-woong.

22
00:01:16,934 --> 00:01:18,269
Do you think you're human?

23
00:01:20,438 --> 00:01:22,940
You have a huge ego for a test subject.

24
00:01:23,775 --> 00:01:25,985
Choi Geun-cheol didn't teach you properly.

25
00:01:26,736 --> 00:01:30,031
He decided to dump you all for a reason.

26
00:01:32,575 --> 00:01:35,536
You're telling me Choi Geun-cheol
and Hwang Deuk-gu are connected, right?

27
00:01:36,954 --> 00:01:39,165
And it was Choi Geun-cheol's decision

28
00:01:39,791 --> 00:01:41,501
to put those test subjects, right?

29
00:01:43,795 --> 00:01:45,088
A bastard like you

30
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:47,131
shouldn't be a cop.

31
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:03,981
Were you the one

32
00:02:04,982 --> 00:02:07,527
who sent those test subjects?

33
00:02:08,986 --> 00:02:10,905
I had to allow it

34
00:02:12,115 --> 00:02:13,366
in order to protect Rugal.

35
00:02:14,992 --> 00:02:15,993
Right.

36
00:02:17,245 --> 00:02:18,538
You're willing to do anything

37
00:02:19,831 --> 00:02:21,165
when it comes to Rugal.

38
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:23,418
So

39
00:02:25,169 --> 00:02:26,671
is that why you killed Gi-beom's wife,

40
00:02:27,964 --> 00:02:29,507
gouged out his eyes,

41
00:02:31,926 --> 00:02:33,386
and even killed my sister?

42
00:02:36,264 --> 00:02:37,306
Was it all

43
00:02:38,641 --> 00:02:40,184
part of your plan?

44
00:02:42,812 --> 00:02:45,690
"No matter what happens,
one will not hold Rugal responsible."

45
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:49,068
Did you forget that?

46
00:02:49,318 --> 00:02:50,653
Answer me!

47
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,600
That was a big job.

48
00:03:20,683 --> 00:03:22,852
She had it coming.
Why did she rat us out to the police?

49
00:03:22,935 --> 00:03:23,853
Let's go.

50
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:37,950
<i>A member of Argos was betrayed
by other members of Argos.</i>

51
00:03:38,034 --> 00:03:42,371
BACKGROUND CHECK RESULT

52
00:03:42,955 --> 00:03:47,293
<i>I needed an element of surprise
from the fallout.</i>

53
00:04:17,532 --> 00:04:18,908
Right after they cut my arm,

54
00:04:20,117 --> 00:04:23,246
you showed up to save me
at the perfect timing.

55
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:25,540
Because I needed you!

56
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:43,099
Have you already forgotten
what you had done

57
00:04:44,392 --> 00:04:45,810
and who you used to be?

58
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:49,188
Just because I buried your past,

59
00:04:50,314 --> 00:04:51,774
it doesn't mean you should forget it.

60
00:06:11,312 --> 00:06:14,398
You probably know they run crazy
experiments here on people they kidnap.

61
00:06:15,524 --> 00:06:17,234
So how does it feel
to be kidnapped yourself?

62
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:21,155
Their screaming almost drove me insane.

63
00:06:21,238 --> 00:06:22,615
Don't sound so indifferent.

64
00:06:22,698 --> 00:06:24,450
You could have been one of the victims.

65
00:06:25,034 --> 00:06:25,952
Why don't you wait

66
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:29,413
over there in place of me?

67
00:06:29,997 --> 00:06:32,333
That might be the best way
to get rid of Hwang Deuk-gu.

68
00:06:32,917 --> 00:06:34,126
Do you think getting rid of him

69
00:06:35,252 --> 00:06:36,545
would solve all the problems?

70
00:06:37,588 --> 00:06:39,173
-Wouldn't it?
-Don't you want to weed out

71
00:06:39,256 --> 00:06:40,716
the root, turn it upside down,

72
00:06:41,258 --> 00:06:42,385
and turn over a new leaf?

73
00:06:45,137 --> 00:06:46,013
Are you telling me

74
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:49,350
to leave Argos?

75
00:06:49,433 --> 00:06:51,435
That's how you got yourself in this mess.

76
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:53,145
Look at you. Hwang Deuk-gu kidnapped you.

77
00:07:02,113 --> 00:07:03,239
Gwang-cheol.

78
00:07:21,215 --> 00:07:22,299
What's the matter with you?

79
00:07:28,264 --> 00:07:29,432
Leave now.

80
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:50,369
Dr. Oh!

81
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:53,914
Mi-na.

82
00:08:01,505 --> 00:08:03,007
I'm so glad you're okay.

83
00:08:03,215 --> 00:08:06,469
You guys risk your lives for Rugal.
And I did the same.

84
00:08:09,013 --> 00:08:11,557
Dr. Oh, Hwang Deuk-gu
kidnapped Gwang-cheol.

85
00:08:12,933 --> 00:08:14,560
He must be somewhere in there.

86
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:16,604
I'm sure Gi-beom will find him.

87
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:44,090
Mi-na!

88
00:08:50,221 --> 00:08:51,263
Gi-beom.

89
00:08:54,016 --> 00:08:54,892
Gwang-cheol.

90
00:08:57,019 --> 00:08:58,020
Mi-na.

91
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:05,820
Mi-na is in trouble. We need help.

92
00:09:07,404 --> 00:09:08,405
Dr. Oh?

93
00:09:47,111 --> 00:09:48,654
What did they do to you?

94
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,542
It can be turned on and off remotely.

95
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:03,127
There's a pressure sensor,

96
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:05,045
which means
he was able to control the voltage.

97
00:10:05,546 --> 00:10:08,174
By pressing this spot right here
like this.

98
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:14,680
Wake up, Gwang-cheol!

99
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:23,063
Gwang-cheol, are you okay?

100
00:10:28,402 --> 00:10:29,278
Gi-beom.

101
00:10:30,988 --> 00:10:31,864
Get up.

102
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:36,493
Hey, are you all right?

103
00:10:38,245 --> 00:10:39,163
I'm sorry.

104
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,292
I don't feel like myself.

105
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,670
I adjusted the voltage. You'll be fine.

106
00:10:46,754 --> 00:10:47,963
We'll have Dr. Oh treat you.

107
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:51,217
Did you find Dr. Oh?

108
00:10:51,926 --> 00:10:52,927
Yes.

109
00:10:53,802 --> 00:10:54,887
Darn it.

110
00:11:02,603 --> 00:11:03,771
Mi-na!

111
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:14,281
Mi-na...

112
00:12:13,507 --> 00:12:15,009
<i>I'll continue to be on the lookout.</i>

113
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:20,806
Then, I'll trust you guys
and get some sleep.

114
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:27,479
Gosh, what are you talking about?
You're so good at it.

115
00:12:27,563 --> 00:12:28,564
With you?

116
00:12:53,297 --> 00:12:55,924
Take my word and trust me.
My body won't last long.

117
00:12:56,925 --> 00:12:58,844
Dr. Oh can take care of you.

118
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:00,554
Quit talking nonsense.

119
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:04,183
I was always anxious.

120
00:13:05,809 --> 00:13:08,854
I was always insecure
because I'm not special like you guys.

121
00:13:10,647 --> 00:13:12,816
I was always lonely because I thought

122
00:13:14,109 --> 00:13:15,361
no one approved of me.

123
00:13:18,655 --> 00:13:20,449
So you know that you are not special.

124
00:13:21,116 --> 00:13:23,702
Just focus on getting recovered
and living a diligent life.

125
00:13:25,913 --> 00:13:27,873
Hwang Deuk-gu could see through me.

126
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:30,042
I didn't have

127
00:13:31,627 --> 00:13:33,045
a presence in Rugal, either.

128
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:35,964
Why would you listen to that thug?

129
00:13:40,344 --> 00:13:41,303
Despite that,

130
00:13:42,513 --> 00:13:45,015
I managed to beat you, land
a few punches, and fling you down.

131
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,810
I scored a big one before I die

132
00:13:50,104 --> 00:13:51,480
although dying sucks.

133
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:55,651
If you keep saying you're dying,
I'll really end you.

134
00:13:57,277 --> 00:13:58,404
Keep up.

135
00:14:07,037 --> 00:14:08,122
Are you okay?

136
00:14:09,998 --> 00:14:11,125
Hang in there.

137
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:17,089
Are you okay, Tae-woong?

138
00:14:19,049 --> 00:14:21,176
I can perform emergency treatments
for the time being,

139
00:14:21,677 --> 00:14:23,637
but to properly treat them,
we must go to the HQ.

140
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,389
I want you to go to a safe place now.

141
00:14:26,014 --> 00:14:28,600
Once we finish here, we'll come to you.

142
00:14:29,852 --> 00:14:31,603
We have unfinished business here.

143
00:14:34,356 --> 00:14:36,191
Call Susan and Bradley for me.

144
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:38,110
I'll try my best to keep them alive.

145
00:14:39,194 --> 00:14:40,195
Yes, sir.

146
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:42,197
Be careful.

147
00:15:00,007 --> 00:15:01,508
By the way, are you really okay?

148
00:15:06,889 --> 00:15:08,098
What happened?

149
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:10,601
It was just as you expected.

150
00:15:12,436 --> 00:15:16,231
You and I became part of Rugal
just like Choi Geun-cheol planned.

151
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:20,652
What will you do now?

152
00:15:23,113 --> 00:15:24,406
I will

153
00:15:25,699 --> 00:15:27,201
kick him out of Rugal.

154
00:15:29,745 --> 00:15:31,622
I'll go take care of Hwang Deuk-gu first.

155
00:15:42,257 --> 00:15:44,051
Dr. Oh took Mi-na and Gwang-cheol.

156
00:15:44,134 --> 00:15:47,054
-You should go help him.
-I will. I'm getting my stuff now.

157
00:15:47,137 --> 00:15:51,725
By the way, I think Gwang-cheol got
the same shot their test subjects got.

158
00:15:51,808 --> 00:15:53,268
<i>He got really strong all of a sudden.</i>

159
00:15:54,061 --> 00:15:57,940
That might be a similar drug
we used on Ko Yong-deok.

160
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:00,025
Once we dilute the drug, he'll be okay.

161
00:16:01,568 --> 00:16:03,028
Okay. Take good care of him.

162
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:08,033
But Susan hasn't come back
when she left to meet with the chief.

163
00:16:08,116 --> 00:16:10,327
-Should I get going first?
<i>-Yes, hurry.</i>

164
00:16:11,161 --> 00:16:12,246
Okay.

165
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:17,751
I just left the building.

166
00:16:22,005 --> 00:16:23,799
-Hold on.
<i>-What is it?</i>

167
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:04,131
Seol Min-jun...

168
00:17:05,841 --> 00:17:09,136
His dead body is abandoned
in front of the HQ.

169
00:17:09,219 --> 00:17:10,304
What?

170
00:17:12,806 --> 00:17:15,267
I'm on my way to destroy the crazy bastard
responsible for that.

171
00:17:20,981 --> 00:17:21,940
Gi-beom.

172
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:25,986
I really want you to kill that scumbag.

173
00:17:26,486 --> 00:17:29,573
Don't worry. I'll put an end
to this today no matter what.

174
00:17:45,088 --> 00:17:46,214
Guess what they are.

175
00:17:47,883 --> 00:17:50,218
When Ko Yong-deok failed to open
Bong Man-cheol's vault

176
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:51,928
with his iris,

177
00:17:52,721 --> 00:17:54,181
his eyeballs burned down.

178
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:00,937
The key to the ledger
of the political slush fund

179
00:18:01,021 --> 00:18:02,689
Ko Yong-deok left behind is gone.

180
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:04,566
How does that feel?

181
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,777
I have no idea what you're talking about.

182
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:07,944
In life,

183
00:18:08,945 --> 00:18:12,157
some are destined to work like a dog,
and some, to enjoy the luxury.

184
00:18:15,202 --> 00:18:17,663
I would like to check something.

185
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:20,666
What are you doing?

186
00:18:21,124 --> 00:18:22,793
If Ko Yong-deok couldn't open it,

187
00:18:24,586 --> 00:18:26,380
you must be able to, then.

188
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:29,299
If you were dying to check it,

189
00:18:29,925 --> 00:18:31,802
you should have killed me in the lab.

190
00:18:31,885 --> 00:18:33,845
That was my plan, but you managed to

191
00:18:35,055 --> 00:18:37,599
get Kang Gi-beom here before I knew it.

192
00:18:38,433 --> 00:18:40,185
Did you let him go

193
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:42,104
because you were scared?

194
00:18:43,605 --> 00:18:46,525
I prepared a grand event just for him.

195
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:49,736
As for you...

196
00:19:37,451 --> 00:19:38,618
Wait here.

197
00:19:40,996 --> 00:19:42,247
You will be the last.

198
00:20:06,021 --> 00:20:08,023
UNKNOWN CALLER
ACCEPT, DECLINE

199
00:20:13,403 --> 00:20:15,280
<i>Did you have a nice funeral
for your dead wife?</i>

200
00:20:16,156 --> 00:20:18,158
<i>Did you come to my turf
after sending her off?</i>

201
00:20:19,075 --> 00:20:20,660
Was it to see Choi Ye-won or me?

202
00:20:20,869 --> 00:20:23,038
Why were you hiding like a rat?
What are you scared of?

203
00:20:25,373 --> 00:20:27,000
Isn't it nice to keep the suspense going?

204
00:20:28,502 --> 00:20:29,836
Shall we meet now?

205
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:34,174
You're finally asking to meet.
I guess your time has come to an end now.

206
00:20:35,717 --> 00:20:38,929
I feel bad that
people from your side keep dying.

207
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:43,099
Fine. I ought to pick out
a burial site for you.

208
00:20:43,683 --> 00:20:44,643
<i>Where should I bury you?</i>

209
00:20:44,726 --> 00:20:46,937
It looked like you already have
a lot of bodies to bury.

210
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,522
<i>I don't want to add onto that.</i>

211
00:20:49,105 --> 00:20:50,315
Where are you, you asshole?

212
00:20:50,941 --> 00:20:53,151
I snatched up a new lab.

213
00:20:54,027 --> 00:20:56,279
Try to keep up. You're good at that.

214
00:21:00,867 --> 00:21:02,077
Locate Hwang Deuk-gu.

215
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:43,535
Don't go to the HQ
until I give you a green light.

216
00:21:44,911 --> 00:21:46,788
<i>Mi-na. Gwang-cheol.
Focus on your treatment.</i>

217
00:21:48,832 --> 00:21:52,168
<i>Everyone, get some rest.
I'll put an end to this.</i>

218
00:22:37,213 --> 00:22:40,884
What were you going to do
after abandoning Gi-beom and me?

219
00:22:40,967 --> 00:22:42,177
I

220
00:22:43,553 --> 00:22:46,973
devoted my life to bringing down Argos

221
00:22:48,099 --> 00:22:49,768
and forming Rugal.

222
00:22:52,228 --> 00:22:54,397
I should get rid of any obstacles

223
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:57,317
that may get in my way.

224
00:22:58,693 --> 00:22:59,611
"Obstacles."

225
00:23:00,737 --> 00:23:03,907
Gi-beom went berserk
and I ended up where I am now

226
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:10,121
because of what you did to us
in order to fulfill your goal.

227
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:24,970
I'm going to continue making
human weapons after you all.

228
00:23:26,721 --> 00:23:29,766
I will make tons of them if I need to.

229
00:23:30,433 --> 00:23:31,935
I don't think so.

230
00:24:10,181 --> 00:24:11,307
No one is here.

231
00:24:12,183 --> 00:24:14,310
It's a shame to waste all that money

232
00:24:14,394 --> 00:24:17,105
and people's lives just to bring me down.

233
00:24:37,959 --> 00:24:39,127
Answer me!

234
00:25:01,608 --> 00:25:03,401
The toy you created, Rugal.

235
00:25:04,527 --> 00:25:06,362
They were pretty useful to me, too.

236
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:08,198
Don't you dare run your mouth.

237
00:25:08,782 --> 00:25:09,741
Why not?

238
00:25:10,158 --> 00:25:11,993
I know a bit about how it all began.

239
00:25:12,744 --> 00:25:14,370
If I knew you'd be a monster,

240
00:25:15,371 --> 00:25:16,664
I should have stopped you, then.

241
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:21,628
You still think you call the shots.

242
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:26,800
Kang Gi-beom's gun which used to point
at me is pointing at you now.

243
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:28,843
And you brought it upon yourself.

244
00:25:29,427 --> 00:25:30,720
You just worry about yourself.

245
00:25:31,387 --> 00:25:33,014
I'll handle him.

246
00:25:37,685 --> 00:25:39,104
Like you didn't know what I'd do,

247
00:25:41,898 --> 00:25:43,316
you don't know Kang Gi-beom.

248
00:26:09,217 --> 00:26:11,678
I wish Choi Geun-cheol was here
to see this with me.

249
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:36,369
We should have a showdown.

250
00:26:37,245 --> 00:26:38,246
Rugal

251
00:26:39,372 --> 00:26:40,456
versus Rugal.

252
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:45,336
Shut the fuck up. You can blabber away
all you want when you go to hell.

253
00:27:58,826 --> 00:28:00,620
You're such a weakling.

254
00:28:01,955 --> 00:28:03,122
I'm disappointed.

255
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:44,163
Good.

256
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,833
That's the Han Tae-woong I know.

257
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,686
Dr. Oh.

258
00:30:51,979 --> 00:30:53,689
I'm so glad you're alive.

259
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,651
I'm glad to see you guys again.

260
00:30:59,695 --> 00:31:02,281
Why can't we go to the HQ?

261
00:31:05,409 --> 00:31:07,619
-Where's Tae-woong?
-Well...

262
00:31:08,203 --> 00:31:10,914
Tae-woong went to speak with Chief Choi.

263
00:31:10,998 --> 00:31:11,832
Why?

264
00:31:13,125 --> 00:31:14,293
What's going on?

265
00:31:16,169 --> 00:31:17,588
Ask Tae-woong directly later.

266
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:24,511
Gi-beom probably met

267
00:31:25,387 --> 00:31:26,847
with Hwang Deuk-gu by now, right?

268
00:31:27,264 --> 00:31:28,473
I should go.

269
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:34,771
Please...

270
00:32:25,697 --> 00:32:28,450
If you die here,
I'll give you a proper burial.

271
00:32:30,953 --> 00:32:35,332
And I'll take your eyes to the burial,
so that you can see it yourself.

272
00:33:54,244 --> 00:33:55,495
You...

273
00:34:08,675 --> 00:34:09,801
Thanks to you,

274
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:13,180
I had fun.

275
00:34:15,348 --> 00:34:16,808
Kang...

276
00:34:18,852 --> 00:34:19,895
Gi-beom.

277
00:34:43,293 --> 00:34:44,753
-What the hell?
-Hands up.

278
00:34:44,836 --> 00:34:45,879
-Hey, go.
-What's going on?

279
00:34:45,962 --> 00:34:47,005
-Get them!
-What the fuck?

280
00:34:47,089 --> 00:34:48,215
-They're not here!
-Fuck off!

281
00:34:48,298 --> 00:34:49,883
-Damn it!
-Get them!

282
00:34:49,966 --> 00:34:51,635
-Freeze!
-Don't move.

283
00:34:51,718 --> 00:34:54,012
-You bastards!
-What the hell is going on?

284
00:34:54,096 --> 00:34:55,889
-Let go.
-What the fuck!

285
00:34:55,972 --> 00:34:57,891
-Let go!
-What do you think you're doing?

286
00:34:57,974 --> 00:34:59,559
-I said, let go!
-Don't push me!

287
00:34:59,643 --> 00:35:00,894
-Let go!
-Hey!

288
00:35:01,561 --> 00:35:02,896
-Are you all right?
-Help!

289
00:35:02,979 --> 00:35:04,397
-Stay with us.
-Gosh...

290
00:35:07,067 --> 00:35:08,693
119 RESCUE SERVICE

291
00:35:33,218 --> 00:35:35,011
I can't even ask you to forgive me.

292
00:35:38,014 --> 00:35:40,600
I started it to save you and Yeo-jin.

293
00:35:41,101 --> 00:35:42,102
No.

294
00:35:42,853 --> 00:35:46,022
Regardless of the reason,
I should've never done that.

295
00:35:47,274 --> 00:35:48,441
As your friend,

296
00:35:49,276 --> 00:35:50,694
I should not have done such a thing.

297
00:35:53,321 --> 00:35:55,157
And I feel terrible

298
00:35:55,866 --> 00:35:57,284
for what happened to Yeo-jin.

299
00:36:00,537 --> 00:36:02,455
I hope where I punched you
isn't still sore.

300
00:36:06,543 --> 00:36:07,836
I deserve to get beaten up.

301
00:36:08,628 --> 00:36:10,338
You had no choice.

302
00:36:11,256 --> 00:36:12,424
I understand now.

303
00:36:15,177 --> 00:36:16,553
So just forget everything.

304
00:36:16,928 --> 00:36:18,930
Stop wallowing in guilt
and move on with your life.

305
00:36:19,806 --> 00:36:21,308
I'm sure that's what Yeo-jin wants too.

306
00:36:24,144 --> 00:36:25,812
Take care of Hwang Deuk-gu though.

307
00:36:27,272 --> 00:36:28,148
I'll see you around.

308
00:36:31,109 --> 00:36:32,194
Detective Yang.

309
00:38:02,701 --> 00:38:04,369
It's all over now, for real.

310
00:38:08,456 --> 00:38:09,457
But I must say,

311
00:38:10,333 --> 00:38:11,876
it doesn't feel that great.

312
00:38:14,087 --> 00:38:15,213
I feel the same way.

313
00:38:16,423 --> 00:38:17,716
I'm relieved.

314
00:38:18,425 --> 00:38:20,510
But at the same time,
I feel like it's still not over.

315
00:38:21,469 --> 00:38:22,804
I guess

316
00:38:24,931 --> 00:38:27,559
that feeling will stay with us
for as long as we're alive.

317
00:38:29,185 --> 00:38:30,186
Tae-woong.

318
00:38:31,479 --> 00:38:33,106
What are we going to do now, by the way?

319
00:38:37,277 --> 00:38:38,695
We'll think about it

320
00:38:39,237 --> 00:38:40,363
once everyone recovers.

321
00:38:43,283 --> 00:38:45,243
Will the world accept us back?

322
00:38:49,789 --> 00:38:52,125
In order to go back out in the world
without feeling ashamed,

323
00:38:55,003 --> 00:38:56,087
I should turn myself in.

324
00:39:00,592 --> 00:39:01,718
I need

325
00:39:02,886 --> 00:39:04,054
that time.

00:39:22,364 --> 00:39:25,241
<i>of it being a legal corporation
was finally revealed today.</i>

328
00:39:25,325 --> 00:39:28,661
<i>Argos had always denied
all the allegations</i>

329
00:39:28,745 --> 00:39:31,790
<i>that it might have been the culprit
behind various cold cases.</i>

330
00:39:31,873 --> 00:39:34,167
<i>But now that Vice Chairman Hwang Deuk-gu
has been arrested,</i>

331
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:36,753
<i>conducting human experiments</i>

332
00:39:36,836 --> 00:39:39,589
<i>and reaping illegal profits
off the victims</i>

333
00:39:39,672 --> 00:39:42,884
<i>will all be brought to justice.</i>

334
00:39:47,097 --> 00:39:49,307
The drug seeped
into your artificial organs,

335
00:39:49,391 --> 00:39:51,351
so we have to flush them out
for a few days.

336
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:54,145
It will be painful,
but you can handle it, right?

337
00:39:56,356 --> 00:39:57,399
Yes, I'll get through it.

338
00:39:58,608 --> 00:39:59,609
Good.

339
00:40:02,737 --> 00:40:05,365
Gosh, how did you hold out?

340
00:40:07,492 --> 00:40:09,661
You must not move for the next few weeks.

341
00:40:09,744 --> 00:40:11,371
If you do, the wounds will open up.

342
00:40:11,579 --> 00:40:12,455
Okay.

343
00:40:18,461 --> 00:40:19,838
Susan and Chief Choi

344
00:40:22,257 --> 00:40:23,425
passed away.

345
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:15,059
RESTRICTED AREA

346
00:41:18,855 --> 00:41:22,066
We will follow the police funeral customs
for Susan and Chief Choi.

347
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:25,570
I wonder who killed Susan.

348
00:41:26,279 --> 00:41:27,864
Talk about odd timing.

349
00:41:27,947 --> 00:41:30,742
A lot of the files related to Rugal
are gone.

350
00:41:31,451 --> 00:41:33,495
Bradley is trying to track down
who did it.

351
00:41:33,578 --> 00:41:35,997
They were probably planning
to start something new.

352
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,000
But someone figured it out

353
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:40,668
and stole the files.

354
00:41:42,837 --> 00:41:46,799
Who'd be interested
in something like that?

355
00:41:47,383 --> 00:41:49,344
Let's just hope
they won't be put to bad use.

356
00:41:50,178 --> 00:41:52,430
It's not like I wasn't mentally prepared,

357
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:54,516
but I still feel betrayed and dejected.

358
00:41:54,641 --> 00:41:55,517
And even Susan...

359
00:41:57,727 --> 00:41:59,938
Now that I'm actually faced with it,
it is hard to endure.

360

DELETE

378
00:44:11,694 --> 00:44:14,238
It'll take a while,
but I will pay you well

379
00:44:14,322 --> 00:44:16,741
for getting rid of Hwang Deuk-gu
as I promised.

380
00:44:17,325 --> 00:44:18,368
That's not necessary.

381
00:44:18,993 --> 00:44:20,244
Choi Ye-won.

382
00:44:20,370 --> 00:44:23,247
Personally, I don't hold
any hard feelings against you.

383
00:44:23,831 --> 00:44:25,708
But as long as
you're the chairwoman of Argos,

384
00:44:26,209 --> 00:44:28,836
you'll have to bear the weight
of responsibility that comes with it.

385
00:44:31,047 --> 00:44:32,048
I will.

386
00:44:32,965 --> 00:44:37,679
Argos without Hwang Deuk-gu
will be very different.

387
00:44:40,348 --> 00:44:41,349
To do that,

388
00:44:42,350 --> 00:44:43,226
you'll need this.

389
00:44:44,686 --> 00:44:45,937
<i>Why didn't you kill him?</i>

390
00:44:46,979 --> 00:44:49,941
<i>By any chance,
is it because you feel guilty about</i>

391
00:44:50,024 --> 00:44:52,235
<i>what you did to Chairman Ko?</i>

392
00:44:57,198 --> 00:44:59,450
Choi Ye-won, you're so funny.

393
00:44:59,617 --> 00:45:00,910
"Guilty"?

394
00:45:01,452 --> 00:45:02,537
Me?

395
00:45:04,831 --> 00:45:06,124
You're the one who killed him.

396
00:45:07,291 --> 00:45:09,669
At the reservoir. Don't you remember?

397
00:45:11,087 --> 00:45:13,047
<i>One, two...</i>

398
00:45:13,131 --> 00:45:14,674
<i>Bang!</i>

399
00:45:14,757 --> 00:45:16,843
He's totally out of it.

400
00:45:17,427 --> 00:45:18,469
Are you okay?

401
00:45:19,387 --> 00:45:21,097
Wake up.

402
00:45:21,472 --> 00:45:22,348
<i>Who knows?</i>

403
00:45:23,099 --> 00:45:25,017
Thanks to Ko Yong-deok's rotten corpse,

404
00:45:25,893 --> 00:45:28,187
you might be able to catch
a gigantic fish.

405
00:45:43,911 --> 00:45:47,582
Ms. Choi Ye-won? You're under arrest
for the murder of Ko Yong-deok.

406
00:45:47,665 --> 00:45:49,917
You have the right to an attorney

407
00:45:50,418 --> 00:45:51,919
and the right to remain silent.

408
00:45:55,214 --> 00:45:56,424
What the hell are you doing?

409
00:45:56,507 --> 00:45:58,843
You need to pay
for the crimes you've committed.

410
00:45:58,926 --> 00:46:00,428
You can turn over a new leaf later on.

411
00:46:00,511 --> 00:46:02,764
Do you actually think
you can get me locked up?

412
00:46:02,847 --> 00:46:04,056
Absolutely not.

413
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:06,309
All your higher-ups

414
00:46:06,434 --> 00:46:07,852
are under my thumb.

415
00:46:09,979 --> 00:46:10,813
-Take her.
-Yes, sir.

416
00:46:10,897 --> 00:46:11,856
Fine.

417
00:46:12,732 --> 00:46:15,777
I'll cooperate,
so don't you dare lay a finger on me.

418
00:46:17,653 --> 00:46:18,654
I guess this is it.

419
00:46:19,572 --> 00:46:20,531
Take care.

420
00:46:50,937 --> 00:46:51,813
Mr. Lee Gwang-cheol?

421
00:46:55,691 --> 00:46:57,068
We have to ask you a few questions.

422
00:46:58,361 --> 00:47:00,488
Can you tell us what Rugal used to do
in detail?

423
00:47:01,155 --> 00:47:04,075
Are Rugal and Argos Hunters
the same organization?

424
00:47:05,159 --> 00:47:08,371
There's something
you should take care of first.

425
00:47:10,998 --> 00:47:13,042
When I was taken to the lab, I heard that

426
00:47:13,167 --> 00:47:16,003
the test subjects and the victims
whose chips got swapped

427
00:47:17,046 --> 00:47:19,590
might experience side effects
even after the chips are removed.

428
00:47:20,424 --> 00:47:21,801
That's dangerous.

429
00:47:22,927 --> 00:47:25,012
I think that's more of a pressing issue

430
00:47:25,304 --> 00:47:26,764
than your interest in Argos Hunters.

431
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:30,893
Right. Thank you.

432
00:47:56,836 --> 00:47:59,630
My gosh, Rugal saved all these people?

433
00:48:00,798 --> 00:48:02,341
You're realizing that just now?

434
00:48:02,466 --> 00:48:04,594
These people should all get tested, right?

435
00:48:04,677 --> 00:48:07,972
Did you not hear about the side effects?
They'll turn into monsters.

436
00:48:08,848 --> 00:48:10,391
-Call all of them.
-Yes, sir.

437
00:48:16,981 --> 00:48:19,817
All right. I guess we should go
our own separate ways now.

438
00:48:21,569 --> 00:48:23,404
It's really over now.

439
00:48:23,487 --> 00:48:25,197
You're the one who said

440
00:48:25,323 --> 00:48:27,533
that we exist to vanish.

441
00:48:29,285 --> 00:48:30,995
This day has finally come.

442
00:48:31,704 --> 00:48:33,497
Frankly, I didn't think it'd ever come.

443
00:48:34,916 --> 00:48:37,501
The government doesn't acknowledge us,

444
00:48:37,585 --> 00:48:39,378
so we can't really hide.

445
00:48:39,795 --> 00:48:41,839
But being together
will be even more uncomfortable.

446
00:48:43,507 --> 00:48:45,843
-Did you all decide what to do?
-I feel daunted.

447
00:48:46,052 --> 00:48:48,804
I was much happier
when I had regular paychecks.

448
00:48:48,888 --> 00:48:49,889
I'm too old to be jobless.

449
00:48:49,972 --> 00:48:52,183
Gosh, I don't even know
why you guys are worried.

450
00:48:52,767 --> 00:48:54,977
You're strong, and you're nimble.

451
00:48:55,895 --> 00:48:59,315
Well, you're a tricky one.

452
00:48:59,523 --> 00:49:02,485
But you can just go work part-time
at a convenience store. You're young.

453
00:49:02,568 --> 00:49:03,694
Be adventurous.

454
00:49:03,778 --> 00:49:05,863
If an adventurous spirit
is all you need to live,

455
00:49:05,947 --> 00:49:07,573
who'd be worried?

456
00:49:08,866 --> 00:49:11,994
Gosh, I'm cut out for this job.

457
00:49:13,496 --> 00:49:14,747
I knew you'd say that,

458
00:49:14,830 --> 00:49:17,416
so I prepared gifts for you guys.

459
00:49:21,170 --> 00:49:22,463
Don't be too touched.

460
00:49:22,546 --> 00:49:23,839
This is for you, Tae-woong.

461
00:49:24,423 --> 00:49:25,800
And this is yours, Mi-na.

462
00:49:26,467 --> 00:49:27,343
Thanks.

463
00:49:32,098 --> 00:49:32,932
Where's mine?

464
00:49:33,933 --> 00:49:34,934
What about me?

465
00:49:35,184 --> 00:49:36,811
You're the youngest one.

466
00:49:36,894 --> 00:49:38,229
I want a gift too!

467
00:49:39,563 --> 00:49:43,234
I got you one, of course.
It's the thing you always wanted.

468
00:49:43,317 --> 00:49:45,277
Oh, nice.

469
00:49:45,528 --> 00:49:46,362
It's gold.

470
00:49:47,238 --> 00:49:49,281
My, this is so cool.

471
00:49:51,325 --> 00:49:52,743
-Happy now?
-I am happy indeed.

472
00:49:52,827 --> 00:49:54,537
I want to take some photos.

473
00:52:12,383 --> 00:52:14,343
Hey, do you work here?

474
00:52:16,637 --> 00:52:18,389
-You opened your eyes.
-Do you know me?

475
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:20,808
We're on the same team.

476
00:52:28,149 --> 00:52:29,775
Please get out of my way.

477
00:52:30,901 --> 00:52:31,944
You'll regret this.

478
00:52:32,528 --> 00:52:34,196
Do you think
everything he told you is true?

479
00:52:40,035 --> 00:52:44,874
<i>The police officially confirmed
how Kang Gi-beom</i> <i>was framed by Argos</i>

480
00:52:44,957 --> 00:52:49,128
<i>to be a ruthless killer
who took the life of his own wife.</i>

481
00:52:49,211 --> 00:52:54,049
<i>They apologized for the traumatic shock
Mr. Kang had to suffer from.</i>

482
00:52:54,258 --> 00:52:55,968
<i>A retrial of his case</i>

483
00:52:56,051 --> 00:52:58,345
<i>will clear him of all allegations</i>

484
00:52:58,429 --> 00:53:00,181
<i>and the case</i>

485
00:53:00,264 --> 00:53:02,850
<i>will be reopened to investigate
and capture the true murderer.</i>

486
00:53:02,933 --> 00:53:04,268
KANG GI-BEOM, FALSELY CHARGED

487
00:53:16,822 --> 00:53:17,907
I'll go this way.

488
00:53:18,490 --> 00:53:19,658
Then I'll go that way.

489
00:53:21,827 --> 00:53:23,120
We sure are different, aren't we?

490
00:53:26,373 --> 00:53:27,208
Brother.

491
00:53:32,004 --> 00:53:33,005
I just

492
00:53:33,756 --> 00:53:35,174
wanted to call you that.

493
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:40,638
Well, your brother is all ears
if you have any requests.

494
00:53:41,347 --> 00:53:42,848
I have nothing to ask.

495
00:53:44,350 --> 00:53:46,769
All I want to say is that I'm grateful.

496
00:53:47,269 --> 00:53:48,437
I was happy being on the team.

497
00:53:50,481 --> 00:53:51,482
Me too.

498
00:53:52,858 --> 00:53:54,068
And I mean that.

499
00:54:04,328 --> 00:54:05,246
I'll get going then.

500
00:55:32,624 --> 00:55:34,585
Jeez. I almost mistook you for a threat.

501
00:55:35,586 --> 00:55:36,628
Why are you following me?

502
00:55:37,504 --> 00:55:38,630
I'm not.

503
00:55:39,048 --> 00:55:40,883
We're just going the same way.

504
00:55:40,966 --> 00:55:42,676
And which way is that?

505
00:56:05,074 --> 00:56:06,658
-Please enjoy.
-Thank you.

506
00:56:07,159 --> 00:56:08,035
Thank you.

507
00:56:09,495 --> 00:56:11,830
So Bradley the Quack,
what will you do for a living now?

508
00:56:11,914 --> 00:56:13,040
Beats me.

509
00:56:14,750 --> 00:56:16,960
This quack still has skills though,

510
00:56:17,127 --> 00:56:19,463
so I'm more worried
about how you'll make a living.

511
00:56:19,713 --> 00:56:20,964
You're worrying about me?

512
00:56:21,048 --> 00:56:22,508
I can't help it.

513
00:56:24,885 --> 00:56:27,471
It seems like you're asking me

514
00:56:27,554 --> 00:56:29,556
to take you in or something.

515
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:30,641
-Really?
-Yes.

516
00:56:30,724 --> 00:56:33,268
Like I said,
I'm not interested in men that way.

517
00:56:34,061 --> 00:56:37,398
You'll be helping me
put these eyes to better use.

518
00:56:37,481 --> 00:56:38,399
What do you say?

519
00:56:38,482 --> 00:56:40,442
I guess that sounds nice.

520
00:56:40,776 --> 00:56:43,237
But just so you know, I don't come cheap.

521
00:56:43,904 --> 00:56:45,280
I didn't even tell you the details,

522
00:56:45,364 --> 00:56:47,449
but you're already
talking about your paycheck?

523
00:56:48,033 --> 00:56:51,328
Since you're the one with the skills,
you should be bringing in the bread then.

524
00:56:52,121 --> 00:56:54,623
I already knew it,
but you truly are a con-artist.

525
00:56:54,706 --> 00:56:57,126
A con-artist?
You think you're a smart ass, don't you?

526
00:56:59,211 --> 00:57:00,462
Anyway, dig in.

527
00:57:03,757 --> 00:57:04,758
Go on.

528
00:57:13,168 --> 00:57:16,671
A FEW YEARS LATER

529
00:57:36,483 --> 00:57:37,442
R DELIVERIES

530
00:57:43,823 --> 00:57:44,824
Unbelievable.

531
00:57:45,492 --> 00:57:47,035
How could you walk all the way here

532
00:57:47,118 --> 00:57:49,788
when I was waiting for you
at the detention center?

533
00:57:50,956 --> 00:57:52,165
Did you wait a long while?

534
00:57:52,499 --> 00:57:55,001
It's nothing compared
to the years I had to wait.

535
00:57:56,044 --> 00:57:58,922
Who knew that your service at Rugal

536
00:57:59,005 --> 00:58:02,175
would put you up for early parole?

537
00:58:02,259 --> 00:58:05,136
Tell me about it.
I guess we were really famous.

538
00:58:05,804 --> 00:58:06,972
Is that so?

539
00:58:07,472 --> 00:58:09,307
It's been a while since we talked,

540
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:10,767
so tell me all about it.

541
00:58:12,978 --> 00:58:13,895
Is that your ride?

542
00:58:14,521 --> 00:58:16,147
I bought one. Sweet, isn't it?

543
00:58:16,481 --> 00:58:17,482
Let's ride.

544
00:58:24,030 --> 00:58:25,198
Are you sure it works?

545
00:58:26,074 --> 00:58:28,243
It may not seem like it, but it's new.

546
00:58:35,709 --> 00:58:38,712
What are your thoughts on forming
another black ops program like Rugal?

547
00:58:38,795 --> 00:58:41,298
Black ops programs are dangerous
by just existing.

548
00:58:41,381 --> 00:58:43,049
And agents with artificial body parts--

549
00:58:43,133 --> 00:58:45,760
We have other crimes surging
in our metropolitan areas.

550
00:58:45,844 --> 00:58:48,179
It'll decrease the pressure
on our police officers...

551
00:59:14,205 --> 00:59:16,249
Thank you, Mr. Han!

552
00:59:23,798 --> 00:59:25,383
I told you to call me Tae-woong.

553
00:59:26,051 --> 00:59:27,010
Oh, right.

554
00:59:27,761 --> 00:59:29,512
Got it, Mr. Tae-woong.

555
00:59:31,806 --> 00:59:34,059
I mean, Tae-woong.

556
00:59:35,602 --> 00:59:37,270
-Let's get back to work.
-Sure.

557
00:59:51,242 --> 00:59:54,162
Are you taking selfies, boss?

558
01:00:03,338 --> 01:00:04,172
Tae-woong,

559
01:00:05,131 --> 01:00:06,674
how are we supposed to manage

560
01:00:06,758 --> 01:00:09,219
when we keep hiring
ex-Argos members to help them

561
01:00:09,302 --> 01:00:10,261
on a limited revenue?

562
01:00:10,345 --> 01:00:11,554
Should we ignore them, then?

563
01:00:12,138 --> 01:00:14,057
They're trying to
straighten out their lives,

564
01:00:14,140 --> 01:00:15,642
so of course we should help.

565
01:00:15,725 --> 01:00:18,812
Then at least cut back on food expenses.
Do you even know how much they eat?

566
01:00:18,895 --> 01:00:20,605
It's like I'm feeding elephants.

567
01:00:21,815 --> 01:00:23,274
I'll work extra shifts then.

568
01:00:24,567 --> 01:00:27,112
You just have to make me
look like the bad guy, right?

569
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:31,199
We're done for the day,
so let's grab a beer.

570
01:00:31,783 --> 01:00:32,742
Deal.

571
01:00:33,535 --> 01:00:34,411
Cheers.

572
01:00:40,166 --> 01:00:41,084
I remember

573
01:00:42,085 --> 01:00:43,920
how we used to play pool

574
01:00:44,003 --> 01:00:46,172
as well as the fun I had with you all.

575
01:00:46,464 --> 01:00:48,466
-Rock-paper-scissors.
-Rock-paper-scissors.

576
01:00:50,009 --> 01:00:53,471
You need more than
just your strength to play pool. You know?

577
01:00:54,848 --> 01:00:56,182
When will that stop?

578
01:00:57,517 --> 01:00:59,310
Nice!

579
01:01:14,742 --> 01:01:18,121
We had our fair share
of pain and heartache too.

580
01:01:19,956 --> 01:01:20,957
I know.

581
01:01:22,709 --> 01:01:24,836
Does being the muscle
ever get old for you?

582
01:01:27,088 --> 01:01:28,882
I have to keep at it
or the arm will get rusty.

583
01:01:28,965 --> 01:01:32,010
And that includes getting
the bad guys from time to time?

584
01:01:32,510 --> 01:01:33,887
That's right.

585
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:37,015
That's what you've been doing too.

586
01:01:42,187 --> 01:01:44,272
I miss Gi-beom and Mi-na.

587
01:01:45,231 --> 01:01:47,942
They don't answer my emails
and they haven't been in touch.

588
01:01:54,199 --> 01:01:55,909
I wonder what they're up to.

589
01:02:17,222 --> 01:02:19,390
I'll be back
when I finally am brave enough

590
01:02:20,850 --> 01:02:22,393
to forgive you.

591
01:02:25,939 --> 01:02:27,398
Thank you, Chief.

592
01:03:39,178 --> 01:03:43,099
There are a few conditions
that promise the perfect brew.

593
01:03:43,182 --> 01:03:46,144
The temperature of the water
and the amount of coffee

594
01:03:46,227 --> 01:03:48,646
can all affect
how your brewed coffee tastes.

595
01:03:48,730 --> 01:03:50,857
Like I mentioned in my earlier class,

596
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:52,483
you shouldn't

597
01:03:52,567 --> 01:03:55,069
pour water on one spot
which is what some of you did.

598
01:03:55,695 --> 01:03:59,324
Pouring in your water
in a slow spiral motion

599
01:03:59,407 --> 01:04:00,742
is what makes

600
01:04:00,825 --> 01:04:03,202
the coffee taste good
up until the third brew.

601
01:04:05,204 --> 01:04:06,331
Please watch the steps.

602
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,376
That was nice.

603
01:04:13,212 --> 01:04:14,839
I'll see you all next week.

604
01:04:14,922 --> 01:04:16,132
Thanks. Have a good day.

605
01:05:18,319 --> 01:05:19,487
Hold on.

606
01:05:19,946 --> 01:05:21,322
Why were you back there?

607
01:05:31,791 --> 01:05:32,792
You fucker.

608
01:05:32,875 --> 01:05:34,210
Fucker?

609
01:05:34,752 --> 01:05:36,504
That's rich coming from a druggie.

610
01:05:38,881 --> 01:05:40,049
You shithead.

611
01:05:43,219 --> 01:05:45,596
What the hell? He died?

612
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:48,349
<i>It seemed like
you wanted to kill him, so...</i>

613
01:05:48,433 --> 01:05:50,476
Are you kidding me?

614
01:05:50,893 --> 01:05:51,728
Get rid of it.

615
01:05:53,938 --> 01:05:56,149
I didn't think
it'd knock him out cold though.

616
01:05:56,232 --> 01:05:57,650
What a wimp.

617
01:06:13,124 --> 01:06:14,167
Hey, you.

618
01:06:17,086 --> 01:06:18,129
Here.

619
01:06:21,716 --> 01:06:23,468
What's that?

620
01:06:23,634 --> 01:06:25,845
You don't know?
Then I'll just throw it away.

621
01:06:25,928 --> 01:06:28,097
Do you have any idea
how expensive this is?

622
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:31,851
Let go...

623
01:06:32,101 --> 01:06:33,394
So you're the dealer.

624
01:06:33,978 --> 01:06:35,062
Bastard.

625
01:06:45,072 --> 01:06:46,866
Not again.

626
01:06:47,116 --> 01:06:49,577
Why are the kids these days
all a bunch of wimps?

627
01:06:56,083 --> 01:06:57,084
Jeez.

628
01:07:03,049 --> 01:07:04,425
Sons of bitches.

629
01:07:04,509 --> 01:07:07,637
How high up the food chain does this go?
