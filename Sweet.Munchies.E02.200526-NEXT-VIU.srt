1
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:19,748
It's good.

2
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:21,218
It's delicious.

3
00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:24,168
His looks and his culinary skills.

4
00:01:24,168 --> 00:01:27,159
Isn't he what we've been looking for, Ms. Kim?

5
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:29,858
Yes. Right?

6
00:01:30,409 --> 00:01:34,118
I agree. I mean, look at his hands.

7
00:01:34,118 --> 00:01:35,879
He has such nice hands, doesn't he?

8
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:37,468
He does have really beautiful hands.

9
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:40,369
Ah Jin.

10
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:42,569
Come to my office.

11
00:01:44,489 --> 00:01:47,209
Oh, Chef Park. I'd like to speak to you in my office as well.

12
00:01:47,558 --> 00:01:48,608
Me too?

13
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:27,588
All right. We're rolling.

14
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:29,649
Cue!

15
00:02:43,988 --> 00:02:45,399
Gosh, there he goes again.

16
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:51,328
What's wrong? Is he doing that again?

17
00:02:51,328 --> 00:02:52,689
Like always.

18
00:02:52,689 --> 00:02:54,179
I guess he has a lot on his mind.

19
00:02:54,499 --> 00:02:56,298
All right, we'll take a quick break!

20
00:02:56,298 --> 00:02:57,348
Who do you think...

21
00:02:59,629 --> 00:03:01,949
made this model so depressed?

22
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:09,258
When you wear clothes, you don't just wear fabric.

23
00:03:10,478 --> 00:03:11,859
You wear emotions.

24
00:03:15,018 --> 00:03:16,899
Evoking emotions.

25
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:19,639
That's what fashion is all about.

26
00:03:22,788 --> 00:03:24,609
You guys ruined the model's mood...

27
00:03:25,228 --> 00:03:27,149
as well as mine.

28
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:50,869
If one person on your team were to be disqualified,

29
00:03:51,288 --> 00:03:53,369
who do you think should be sent home?

30
00:03:57,929 --> 00:03:59,079
Actually,

31
00:03:59,488 --> 00:04:02,308
he's slow and doesn't have the basic skills.

32
00:04:02,358 --> 00:04:04,179
That made it hard for all of us.

33
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:07,248
But the design was yours.

34
00:04:07,638 --> 00:04:11,019
I think the wrong choice was made...

35
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:13,939
for the material, the first step.

36
00:04:13,939 --> 00:04:17,329
You all liked it at first.

37
00:04:17,608 --> 00:04:20,529
- I said you should change it. - When did you say that?

38
00:04:21,148 --> 00:04:23,339
You worked as a team for a few days.

39
00:04:24,448 --> 00:04:25,498
However,

40
00:04:28,189 --> 00:04:30,578
no one is using the word "we".

41
00:04:33,559 --> 00:04:36,578
If you want to clothe many people in my clothes,

42
00:04:37,999 --> 00:04:40,018
you have to get used to working as a team.

43
00:04:42,239 --> 00:04:44,058
You can't work alone.

44
00:04:45,768 --> 00:04:47,388
It's the same for everything.

45
00:04:52,078 --> 00:04:53,229
Wait.

46
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:56,938
(Script)

47
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:02,708
You all...

48
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:07,109
are disqualified.

49
00:05:56,549 --> 00:05:57,698
Excuse me.

50
00:06:28,109 --> 00:06:29,429
Ms. Cha,

51
00:06:29,908 --> 00:06:34,068
I really want to launch this program with him.

52
00:06:40,018 --> 00:06:42,839
Do your parents know about your sexual orientation?

53
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:46,059
They may...

54
00:06:46,059 --> 00:06:48,308
or may not know about it.

55
00:06:48,359 --> 00:06:51,049
Does that mean they know or not?

56
00:06:53,198 --> 00:06:56,659
I think they might pretend not to know even if they did.

57
00:06:59,408 --> 00:07:03,258
Short clips of the show will be everywhere.

58
00:07:04,278 --> 00:07:05,328
Ms. Cha.

59
00:07:05,679 --> 00:07:08,498
We don't know what people might start picking on.

60
00:07:08,919 --> 00:07:12,299
Your family or friends could get hurt.

61
00:07:12,619 --> 00:07:14,438
Are you still okay with this?

62
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:19,938
Everyone...

63
00:07:20,758 --> 00:07:23,679
gets hurt one way or another.

64
00:07:24,629 --> 00:07:26,419
Ms. Cha.

65
00:07:26,569 --> 00:07:28,499
He has made up his mind and...

66
00:07:28,499 --> 00:07:29,789
Ah Jin.

67
00:07:30,338 --> 00:07:31,419
Yes?

68
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:33,119
Leave us.

69
00:07:33,809 --> 00:07:34,888
Excuse me?

70
00:07:36,508 --> 00:07:38,159
Why is that?

71
00:07:43,179 --> 00:07:44,239
Okay.

72
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:13,929
All right.

73
00:08:15,749 --> 00:08:17,239
I'm divorced.

74
00:08:18,919 --> 00:08:20,819
I have a daughter who is all grown up now.

75
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:22,588
She puts her boyfriend...

76
00:08:22,588 --> 00:08:26,008
and her dog before me.

77
00:08:26,359 --> 00:08:28,658
I'm not interested in men.

78
00:08:28,658 --> 00:08:30,479
I know they're all the same.

79
00:08:31,468 --> 00:08:33,398
All I have left is work,

80
00:08:33,398 --> 00:08:35,689
but it's starting to get boring too.

81
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,189
Comfort me.

82
00:08:42,509 --> 00:08:44,628
Even better if you have a solution.

83
00:08:45,748 --> 00:08:47,428
You want a solution?

84
00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:48,898
Yes.

85
00:08:49,748 --> 00:08:51,498
Say something.

86
00:09:06,738 --> 00:09:10,489
How will you win the viewers over when you can't even get to me?

87
00:09:20,578 --> 00:09:22,028
(Rejected, Revised)

88
00:09:24,988 --> 00:09:26,339
(Monthly Schedule)

89
00:09:30,088 --> 00:09:31,378
Then you should...

90
00:09:38,698 --> 00:09:39,849
just quit.

91
00:09:43,169 --> 00:09:47,028
There is nothing worse than keeping a boring job.

92
00:09:49,478 --> 00:09:51,798
Some of my customers...

93
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:55,599
always talk about quitting their jobs.

94
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:57,998
They are frustrated...

95
00:09:58,218 --> 00:10:00,609
at even the thought of going to work in the morning.

96
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:03,469
It might be the right choice...

97
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:06,508
for them to quit...

98
00:10:09,259 --> 00:10:11,479
rather than waste their lives like that.

99
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:14,089
It's such a waste.

100
00:10:24,309 --> 00:10:25,798
But interestingly,

101
00:10:27,549 --> 00:10:30,439
some of those who say their work is boring...

102
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:35,008
are workaholics.

103
00:10:38,358 --> 00:10:39,628
When they are on vacation,

104
00:10:39,628 --> 00:10:41,949
they pack their laptops instead of swimsuits.

105
00:10:42,498 --> 00:10:45,748
Nature doesn't impress them at all.

106
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:49,689
People like that always return...

107
00:10:50,909 --> 00:10:53,018
to what they love.

108
00:10:53,909 --> 00:10:55,158
So,

109
00:10:56,179 --> 00:10:57,398
you should try quitting.

110
00:10:58,378 --> 00:11:00,229
If you want to figure out what matters to you,

111
00:11:00,978 --> 00:11:04,699
losing it first is an option.

112
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:14,668
I ran into you earlier, right?

113
00:12:15,488 --> 00:12:17,979
Are you okay?

114
00:12:26,098 --> 00:12:29,288
I'm sure you're here since you're okay.

115
00:12:37,049 --> 00:12:40,369
I stand out because of my flashy outfit, right?

116
00:12:44,488 --> 00:12:46,718
I can explain.

117
00:12:46,718 --> 00:12:48,369
There's a thin line...

118
00:12:49,289 --> 00:12:50,809
between fashion and costumes.

119
00:12:54,358 --> 00:12:56,648
If it's too much, you'll look ridiculous.

120
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:00,079
Excuse me.

121
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:04,619
Are you saying that I look ridiculous?

122
00:13:09,009 --> 00:13:10,798
I didn't expect this, Ah Jin.

123
00:13:11,549 --> 00:13:13,729
That wasn't bad for someone you found within a day.

124
00:13:15,978 --> 00:13:18,498
Show me what you had in mind.

125
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,579
Really?

126
00:13:28,429 --> 00:13:29,479
Yes.

127
00:13:35,498 --> 00:13:37,459
Thank you.

128
00:13:38,509 --> 00:13:40,158
Seriously...

129
00:13:40,978 --> 00:13:43,829
Thank you so much for giving me this chance.

130
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:47,199
I'll make a great show by all means.

131
00:13:49,718 --> 00:13:50,768
Thank you.

132
00:13:52,848 --> 00:13:53,969
Thank you so much.

133
00:13:55,588 --> 00:13:56,709
Okay.

134
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:02,878
Thank you, Ms. Cha!

135
00:14:05,098 --> 00:14:06,918
Isn't that what you've been thinking too?

136
00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:10,069
- Pardon? - You've been self-conscious...

137
00:14:10,069 --> 00:14:11,658
the whole time.

138
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:15,628
As if you're wearing someone else's clothes.

139
00:14:19,448 --> 00:14:21,998
There's also a thin line between over-the-top and fancy.

140
00:14:23,419 --> 00:14:24,869
It's all about balance.

141
00:14:31,488 --> 00:14:33,408
Mr. Kang, are you ready?

142
00:14:39,098 --> 00:14:40,148
See you.

143
00:15:02,289 --> 00:15:03,339
Why...

144
00:15:04,328 --> 00:15:05,538
are you looking at me like that?

145
00:15:07,529 --> 00:15:08,579
Well...

146
00:15:11,598 --> 00:15:14,349
How did you persuade Ms. Cha?

147
00:15:18,569 --> 00:15:21,028
Did I pass?

148
00:15:21,978 --> 00:15:23,528
She said I can make a pilot.

149
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:26,409
- Really? - Thank you so much.

150
00:15:26,409 --> 00:15:27,798
Thank you.

151
00:15:28,578 --> 00:15:29,969
- Ms. Kim. - Yes?

152
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,538
When can I...

153
00:15:34,618 --> 00:15:36,709
When can I get paid?

154
00:15:41,998 --> 00:15:43,048
When can you get paid?

155
00:15:53,468 --> 00:15:55,628
I did it! This is unbelievable.

156
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,329
My goodness.

157
00:16:09,189 --> 00:16:10,638
Sung Eun!

158
00:16:10,659 --> 00:16:12,029
- Sung Eun! - Hey!

159
00:16:12,029 --> 00:16:14,958
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

160
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:16,958
- Can you make the show now? - I can't believe this.

161
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:19,098
- Really? - Can you believe this?

162
00:16:19,098 --> 00:16:21,299
Great job, Ah Jin.

163
00:16:21,299 --> 00:16:22,968
Hey.

164
00:16:22,968 --> 00:16:25,439
By the way, do you know the chef?

165
00:16:25,439 --> 00:16:26,658
It looked like it.

166
00:16:27,378 --> 00:16:30,559
He runs Bistro I often go to.

167
00:16:31,078 --> 00:16:32,549
It's him?

168
00:16:32,549 --> 00:16:34,279
Then you could have cast him from the beginning.

169
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:36,428
Why did you go through all that trouble?

170
00:16:37,319 --> 00:16:38,599
I had no idea.

171
00:16:39,049 --> 00:16:40,099
How come?

172
00:16:40,819 --> 00:16:42,869
You go there all the time.

173
00:16:44,189 --> 00:16:45,309
I know.

174
00:16:45,988 --> 00:16:49,008
Then again, how would you know if he doesn't tell you?

175
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:55,489
Hey, what's with that disappointed look on your face?

176
00:16:56,738 --> 00:16:58,208
It's not like that.

177
00:16:58,208 --> 00:16:59,868
Don't tell me...

178
00:16:59,868 --> 00:17:02,089
you asked him out and he turned you down.

179
00:17:03,978 --> 00:17:05,978
Don't be ridiculous.

180
00:17:05,978 --> 00:17:09,449
By the way, I don't have enough budget.

181
00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:10,738
What should I do?

182
00:17:11,219 --> 00:17:14,408
Let Director Kim Ah Jin take care of it tomorrow.

183
00:17:15,118 --> 00:17:16,938
- Tomorrow? - Today...

184
00:17:17,088 --> 00:17:19,328
is your last day as an assistant director.

185
00:17:19,328 --> 00:17:21,259
We should drink.

186
00:17:21,259 --> 00:17:22,259
Buy me a drink.

187
00:17:22,259 --> 00:17:23,699
- You're a director now. - Okay.

188
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:25,969
Ah Jin, you finally did it.

189
00:17:25,969 --> 00:17:27,438
Congratulations.

190
00:17:27,438 --> 00:17:28,988
Shouldn't we go for a drink?

191
00:17:29,338 --> 00:17:31,888
Where should we go?

192
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:34,408
- What's with him? - No idea.

193
00:17:34,408 --> 00:17:37,979
Right. Guys, the whole hallway...

194
00:17:37,979 --> 00:17:39,709
smells like fried food.

195
00:17:39,709 --> 00:17:42,279
How about we go for some makgeolli?

196
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:43,668
Makgeolli sounds amazing.

197
00:17:46,848 --> 00:17:48,269
- Let's go. - Okay.

198
00:17:48,719 --> 00:17:52,339
Kwang Su, your styling has been pretty good so far.

199
00:17:53,459 --> 00:17:55,549
It's sophisticated, and I like the way you use accessories.

200
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:57,009
It's always controlled.

201
00:17:57,598 --> 00:17:58,648
Dad.

202
00:17:59,398 --> 00:18:02,448
- He's my favorite designer. - I wanted to be bold this time.

203
00:18:03,138 --> 00:18:04,188
Really?

204
00:18:04,638 --> 00:18:07,728
It's my dream to walk the runway in his clothes.

205
00:18:08,779 --> 00:18:10,829
- I'm here. - Hi.

206
00:18:13,378 --> 00:18:14,569
How are you feeling?

207
00:18:14,979 --> 00:18:16,269
I'm okay.

208
00:18:16,979 --> 00:18:19,299
You didn't have to come. What about Bistro?

209
00:18:21,688 --> 00:18:22,938
In Deok is there.

210
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:26,579
- Did you eat? - Hold on.

211
00:18:26,959 --> 00:18:28,378
I don't want to miss this part.

212
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:35,418
It's that jerk.

213
00:18:35,638 --> 00:18:36,988
- Do you have anything to add? - Hey.

214
00:18:37,739 --> 00:18:39,039
Is he famous?

215
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,089
Yes.

216
00:18:40,338 --> 00:18:41,589
How famous?

217
00:18:42,078 --> 00:18:45,529
Famous enough to host a show like that alone at his age.

218
00:18:45,809 --> 00:18:47,198
He's a huge star.

219
00:18:48,078 --> 00:18:49,128
Please go back.

220
00:18:51,918 --> 00:18:53,269
Gosh.

221
00:19:08,239 --> 00:19:11,119
Thanks for taking good care of Dad.

222
00:19:14,209 --> 00:19:16,859
Jin Sung, make some food for me.

223
00:19:17,848 --> 00:19:19,809
At this hour? Are you hungry?

224
00:19:19,809 --> 00:19:22,029
Yes, I'm starving.

225
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:23,628
Gosh.

226
00:19:25,819 --> 00:19:27,559
All right. I'll go change first.

227
00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:28,708
Yes!

228
00:20:30,019 --> 00:20:31,599
What is he doing?

229
00:20:37,158 --> 00:20:38,208
Come here.

230
00:20:42,828 --> 00:20:45,049
Wow, that looks delicious.

231
00:20:47,539 --> 00:20:49,619
Jin Sung, how do I look?

232
00:20:50,098 --> 00:20:51,359
I have an audition soon.

233
00:20:51,438 --> 00:20:52,888
That's why I bought this.

234
00:20:53,908 --> 00:20:55,029
Are you auditioning for a nightclub?

235
00:20:55,678 --> 00:20:56,958
What do I know?

236
00:20:57,338 --> 00:20:59,759
You're right. You know nothing about fashion.

237
00:21:05,348 --> 00:21:06,799
- Jin Woo. - Yes?

238
00:21:08,489 --> 00:21:09,539
How...

239
00:21:10,088 --> 00:21:12,839
did you know you were special?

240
00:21:14,029 --> 00:21:16,127
You're going to nag me, aren't you?

241
00:21:16,128 --> 00:21:18,749
I'm not. I'm just curious.

242
00:21:20,628 --> 00:21:22,589
I just found out naturally.

243
00:21:23,098 --> 00:21:25,158
I realized what I liked,

244
00:21:26,209 --> 00:21:28,928
and it was different from what most people liked.

245
00:21:30,309 --> 00:21:31,428
Can you tell...

246
00:21:32,408 --> 00:21:33,898
just by looking...

247
00:21:34,549 --> 00:21:36,269
whether a person is gay or not?

248
00:21:38,648 --> 00:21:40,539
Not if that person hides it well.

249
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:43,388
Take Tae Sik, the pride of our neighborhood, for example.

250
00:21:43,388 --> 00:21:45,839
No one knew before he came out himself.

251
00:21:47,658 --> 00:21:49,249
No one knew?

252
00:21:51,398 --> 00:21:54,239
You know passion is never enough.

253
00:21:54,239 --> 00:21:57,019
She'll be out of here once her contract is up. Am I wrong?

254
00:21:57,668 --> 00:21:58,958
Let's face it.

255
00:21:59,509 --> 00:22:02,479
Think of Park Sin Ho, Kim Hye Jeong, and Ko Seung Ju.

256
00:22:02,479 --> 00:22:04,348
None of their contracts got extended.

257
00:22:04,348 --> 00:22:05,979
They can't even negotiate their salaries.

258
00:22:05,979 --> 00:22:08,099
They have no reason to stay here.

259
00:22:08,249 --> 00:22:10,279
Who knows "Sweet Munchies" will become a hit and she'll make it big?

260
00:22:10,279 --> 00:22:11,339
You never know.

261
00:22:11,989 --> 00:22:13,049
No way.

262
00:22:13,049 --> 00:22:15,539
There's no way that's going to happen.

263
00:22:16,358 --> 00:22:17,738
What about the assistant director?

264
00:22:18,029 --> 00:22:19,809
I don't need one.

265
00:22:20,328 --> 00:22:21,378
What do you mean?

266
00:22:21,898 --> 00:22:24,229
If No Jae Soo is going to be my assistant director,

267
00:22:24,229 --> 00:22:26,319
I'd rather not have any assistant director at all.

268
00:22:26,598 --> 00:22:29,699
He'll look down on me because I'm not a permanent employee,

269
00:22:29,699 --> 00:22:31,789
and he'll ruin the whole atmosphere.

270
00:22:32,138 --> 00:22:34,688
If you only want to work with people you like,

271
00:22:35,078 --> 00:22:36,658
start a club instead.

272
00:22:36,739 --> 00:22:38,779
You can't make a show alone.

273
00:22:38,779 --> 00:22:40,228
You always need other people.

274
00:22:40,979 --> 00:22:44,648
Still, I couldn't force him to work on this show if he doesn't want to.

275
00:22:44,648 --> 00:22:46,019
Make him want to.

276
00:22:46,019 --> 00:22:48,009
That's also a director's job.

277
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:52,178
This is a jungle.

278
00:22:52,729 --> 00:22:54,858
How many people do you think will recognize and support you...

279
00:22:54,858 --> 00:22:56,978
before you become successful?

280
00:22:58,168 --> 00:22:59,478
Will there even be any?

281
00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:05,359
What are you waiting for? Get out.

282
00:23:31,628 --> 00:23:36,289
Seriously, don't be like this, okay?

283
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:41,688
Ah Jin is working on a show about gay guys.

284
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,029
Lesbians?

285
00:23:44,209 --> 00:23:45,759
Goodness.

286
00:23:46,108 --> 00:23:47,158
Hey.

287
00:23:47,648 --> 00:23:49,249
When one thing takes off,

288
00:23:49,249 --> 00:23:52,569
dozens of other shows with similar concepts get produced, you know?

289
00:23:53,618 --> 00:23:54,989
Ah Jin is working on a show featuring a gay guy.

290
00:23:54,989 --> 00:23:56,668
"A Gay Chef's Sweet Munchies".

291
00:23:56,989 --> 00:23:59,989
"Sweet Desserts by a Lesbian".

292
00:23:59,989 --> 00:24:02,208
Gosh, isn't it such a great idea?

293
00:24:03,858 --> 00:24:05,718
You want to produce a mere remake of the show?

294
00:24:06,969 --> 00:24:08,838
Don't be like this, please.

295
00:24:08,838 --> 00:24:12,158
My face is all red and hot because I'm so embarrassed for you!

296
00:24:13,338 --> 00:24:15,059
Gosh, seriously.

297
00:24:15,438 --> 00:24:16,479
You think it's that lame?

298
00:24:16,479 --> 00:24:17,589
Yes!

299
00:24:21,648 --> 00:24:24,099
Be it a remake or a third-rate show. I don't care.

300
00:24:24,388 --> 00:24:28,069
I just want to produce a show. That's all.

301
00:24:38,098 --> 00:24:39,549
Gosh, why am I getting teary-eyed?

302
00:24:48,608 --> 00:24:50,578
- Bring the paperwork. - Yes, sir.

303
00:24:50,578 --> 00:24:56,999
(Instant Loans 365, Get Cash Today)

304
00:25:05,428 --> 00:25:08,549
I think the amount is wrong.

305
00:25:09,398 --> 00:25:12,019
You said it'd be 4,000 dollars,

306
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:13,549
but the amount is...

307
00:25:13,598 --> 00:25:15,188
That is the correct amount.

308
00:25:15,368 --> 00:25:18,519
That's what you get after deducting the interest in advance.

309
00:25:19,739 --> 00:25:21,078
You deducted the interest in advance?

310
00:25:21,078 --> 00:25:22,658
Goodness gracious.

311
00:25:50,969 --> 00:25:53,458
Sang Young, spare me a moment.

312
00:26:44,846 --> 00:26:46,196
What is this?

313
00:26:47,975 --> 00:26:50,065
Why do I see my name on the staff list?

314
00:26:51,945 --> 00:26:54,466
Let's work on "Sweet Munchies" together.

315
00:26:56,755 --> 00:26:59,735
I know why you don't want to work on "Sweet Munchies".

316
00:27:00,326 --> 00:27:01,446
First off,

317
00:27:01,795 --> 00:27:03,025
we're the same age,

318
00:27:03,025 --> 00:27:04,725
but I joined the company a year earlier,

319
00:27:04,725 --> 00:27:06,195
so you have to use honorifics.

320
00:27:06,195 --> 00:27:07,676
You probably don't like that.

321
00:27:10,035 --> 00:27:12,485
Just talk to me casually. Let's be friends.

322
00:27:13,005 --> 00:27:17,386
But be polite and call me "Director" when we're on set.

323
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:18,696
Gosh.

324
00:27:18,806 --> 00:27:19,926
Secondly,

325
00:27:20,505 --> 00:27:22,966
your position is permanent, whereas I'm on a contract.

326
00:27:23,445 --> 00:27:26,816
Right. As you said, I'm like a short-lived mayfly.

327
00:27:26,816 --> 00:27:29,215
But whether I'm a mayfly or a mosquito,

328
00:27:29,215 --> 00:27:31,835
we all have one life, you know?

329
00:27:32,926 --> 00:27:34,136
Goodness.

330
00:27:35,926 --> 00:27:39,225
And you know how this industry works.

331
00:27:39,225 --> 00:27:41,485
When a show takes off,

332
00:27:42,195 --> 00:27:44,015
your pay goes up drastically.

333
00:27:44,935 --> 00:27:47,785
I'm going to do a really good job with this show.

334
00:27:50,935 --> 00:27:52,196
What's the third reason?

335
00:27:52,745 --> 00:27:54,095
Is there a third reason?

336
00:27:57,275 --> 00:27:59,666
You don't trust me, right?

337
00:28:01,185 --> 00:28:02,866
If that is the case,

338
00:28:03,156 --> 00:28:05,505
just think that you're there to build experience.

339
00:28:06,255 --> 00:28:08,955
"I shouldn't do what Kim Ah Jin is doing."

340
00:28:08,955 --> 00:28:10,805
"If I were in her position, I'd do it this way."

341
00:28:10,955 --> 00:28:14,075
Real firsthand experience, you know?

342
00:28:14,265 --> 00:28:18,985
Such experience can't even be bought with money.

343
00:28:34,285 --> 00:28:37,206
You get drunk fast when you drink during the day.

344
00:28:37,755 --> 00:28:39,725
I'm scared of what you'll do when you're drunk.

345
00:28:39,725 --> 00:28:41,775
Hey, eat something.

346
00:28:44,396 --> 00:28:45,575
Am I...

347
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:47,676
a thief?

348
00:28:47,995 --> 00:28:49,045
What?

349
00:28:49,495 --> 00:28:51,456
Are you dating someone half your age or what?

350
00:28:53,066 --> 00:28:56,255
I feel as though I'm not doing any work and just stealing a salary.

351
00:28:58,606 --> 00:29:00,606
Gosh, that's why...

352
00:29:00,606 --> 00:29:02,995
I told you to just get a managerial position.

353
00:29:05,146 --> 00:29:08,265
If I get a chief producer position, I'll just sit at my desk...

354
00:29:08,386 --> 00:29:11,575
from 9 to 6 and pick on the juniors all day long.

355
00:29:11,886 --> 00:29:13,556
And I'll have to tiptoe around the higher-ups...

356
00:29:13,556 --> 00:29:15,295
and fight to keep my position.

357
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:18,545
Hey, that won't be fun at all.

358
00:29:19,166 --> 00:29:20,446
You see, I...

359
00:29:21,666 --> 00:29:23,985
I like being on set.

360
00:29:41,715 --> 00:29:44,826
This time, I'll have the camera operator pour me one.

361
00:29:44,826 --> 00:29:47,656
What? Are you already bossing us around?

362
00:29:47,656 --> 00:29:49,426
Gosh, no.

363
00:29:49,426 --> 00:29:51,075
You know,

364
00:29:51,265 --> 00:29:54,146
I'll do my best and work really hard.

365
00:29:55,396 --> 00:29:57,485
You're thorough, so you'll do a great job.

366
00:29:57,935 --> 00:29:59,755
- Thank you. - Sure.

367
00:30:00,406 --> 00:30:02,076
- Hey, Director Jang. - You made it.

368
00:30:02,076 --> 00:30:05,505
- Our Lighting Director! Hello. - Hello.

369
00:30:05,505 --> 00:30:06,876
- I'm so happy you made it! - Hi.

370
00:30:06,876 --> 00:30:09,495
- Hello. - What's going on here?

371
00:30:09,545 --> 00:30:11,245
Are you guys wrapping up already?

372
00:30:11,245 --> 00:30:12,785
- Gosh, no. - Of course not.

373
00:30:12,785 --> 00:30:14,586
We're just getting started.

374
00:30:14,586 --> 00:30:17,735
Right? Let me pour you one, Director Kim.

375
00:30:18,426 --> 00:30:21,476
"Director"? My gosh, I'm not used to being called like that.

376
00:30:21,896 --> 00:30:24,575
Gosh, all you directors here.

377
00:30:24,795 --> 00:30:28,066
I'm counting on you.

378
00:30:28,066 --> 00:30:29,116
All right.

379
00:30:29,765 --> 00:30:30,985
Directors.

380
00:30:31,406 --> 00:30:34,535
This is my first show as a director,

381
00:30:34,535 --> 00:30:38,076
and I'm so honored to work with all of you!

382
00:30:38,076 --> 00:30:39,275
I look forward to working with you.

383
00:30:39,275 --> 00:30:43,416
- Here's to her first show! - Cheers!

384
00:30:43,416 --> 00:30:45,166
Cheers!

385
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:01,176
Jin Sung.

386
00:31:02,465 --> 00:31:03,845
Why are you still up?

387
00:31:04,535 --> 00:31:06,366
Hey, don't mind me.

388
00:31:06,366 --> 00:31:08,325
Go back to sleep.

389
00:31:16,745 --> 00:31:19,595
Hey, pull up the blanket.

390
00:31:40,205 --> 00:31:44,226
(Show Appearance Agreement)

391
00:31:52,745 --> 00:31:55,035
This is just wrong.

392
00:32:21,475 --> 00:32:24,995
Oh, I'm home!

393
00:32:26,646 --> 00:32:29,706
Kitty, did you have a good day?

394
00:32:30,285 --> 00:32:32,476
Kitty!

395
00:32:33,126 --> 00:32:34,946
Here, kitty.

396
00:32:35,525 --> 00:32:37,075
Kitty.

397
00:32:37,926 --> 00:32:40,345
Where are you?

398
00:32:40,666 --> 00:32:42,695
Where are you?

399
00:32:42,695 --> 00:32:46,255
Don't hide and come on out.

400
00:32:51,106 --> 00:32:53,245
Here, kitty. Where are you?

401
00:32:53,245 --> 00:32:55,896
You're there, right? Kitty?

402
00:32:56,275 --> 00:32:58,116
Chef Park!

403
00:32:58,116 --> 00:33:00,466
Chef Park, Chef Park!

404
00:33:01,816 --> 00:33:03,235
You must have had a lot to drink.

405
00:33:03,586 --> 00:33:07,376
Yes, I had a drink with the directors.

406
00:33:08,255 --> 00:33:09,545
I see.

407
00:33:11,195 --> 00:33:12,945
What are you doing out here?

408
00:33:14,866 --> 00:33:18,015
Were you... waiting for me by any chance?

409
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:21,726
What?

410
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:24,186
No, it's not that.

411
00:33:24,806 --> 00:33:27,555
I have something to tell you.

412
00:33:27,875 --> 00:33:30,365
You do? To me?

413
00:33:30,576 --> 00:33:31,635
Yes.

414
00:33:32,246 --> 00:33:35,035
I see. I have something to tell you too.

415
00:33:36,386 --> 00:33:37,535
Chef Park,

416
00:33:38,525 --> 00:33:40,376
if it weren't for you,

417
00:33:40,426 --> 00:33:42,845
I wouldn't be able to do this show.

418
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:44,876
You're...

419
00:33:46,295 --> 00:33:48,385
my savior.

420
00:33:49,536 --> 00:33:52,215
My savior. I'll do my best.

421
00:33:53,565 --> 00:33:55,126
I'm home, I'm home.

422
00:34:03,445 --> 00:34:05,635
- I'm totally fine. - Yes, go on up.

423
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:09,085
I'm so drunk, aren't I?

424
00:34:09,085 --> 00:34:10,556
I'm so drunk.

425
00:34:10,556 --> 00:34:12,175
I'll go home now.

426
00:34:12,355 --> 00:34:14,125
Your house is upstairs.

427
00:34:14,125 --> 00:34:16,125
Good night. Go ahead.

428
00:34:16,125 --> 00:34:17,905
No, I'll see you go in first.

429
00:34:18,326 --> 00:34:19,445
- Really? - Yes.

430
00:34:20,366 --> 00:34:21,445
Gosh.

431
00:34:35,415 --> 00:34:36,965
- Go on. Go in. - Okay.

432
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:52,025
I have the money.

433
00:34:52,025 --> 00:34:54,826
This is a contract with CK and it's basically money.

434
00:34:54,826 --> 00:34:56,686
This isn't money.

435
00:34:58,636 --> 00:34:59,686
Well...

436
00:35:00,366 --> 00:35:01,626
Could you give me a week?

437
00:35:02,105 --> 00:35:03,825
If you give me a week,

438
00:35:04,136 --> 00:35:05,396
I'll bring you the money.

439
00:35:23,855 --> 00:35:26,976
I've worked hard all my life.

440
00:35:42,145 --> 00:35:44,465
(Note! It's better to use crunchy fruit or vegetables.)

441
00:35:44,715 --> 00:35:47,465
(Shrimp carpaccio)

442
00:35:48,145 --> 00:35:50,566
(Shrimp salad)

443
00:35:53,226 --> 00:35:55,776
(Salmon flower salad)

444
00:36:09,706 --> 00:36:11,306
If you just give me a few days,

445
00:36:11,306 --> 00:36:13,026
I can wire you the money.

446
00:36:13,246 --> 00:36:14,396
Please.

447
00:36:17,045 --> 00:36:19,666
I'm giving you exactly a week.

448
00:36:22,355 --> 00:36:25,255
Thank you, Grandma. Thank you so much.

449
00:36:25,255 --> 00:36:27,736
Why do you keep calling me "Grandma"?

450
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:29,675
Are you my grandson?

451
00:36:30,156 --> 00:36:31,206
Excuse me?

452
00:36:31,395 --> 00:36:32,845
I'm not a grandma.

453
00:36:33,866 --> 00:36:35,316
I don't even have grandchildren yet.

454
00:36:36,965 --> 00:36:38,015
I see.

455
00:36:43,335 --> 00:36:46,306
Wait, isn't this the outfit...

456
00:36:46,306 --> 00:36:48,965
that was in "Cooking Class"?

457
00:36:49,346 --> 00:36:51,346
You're right. That was intentional.

458
00:36:51,346 --> 00:36:54,396
It looks good in the kitchen.

459
00:36:55,456 --> 00:36:56,506
I see.

460
00:37:03,456 --> 00:37:07,945
This doesn't seem to have anything to do with the kitchen.

461
00:37:08,096 --> 00:37:10,615
I think it does.

462
00:37:10,965 --> 00:37:14,686
It wasn't on TV that often. It's a nice outfit.

463
00:37:21,076 --> 00:37:24,566
This is something I prepared.

464
00:37:24,715 --> 00:37:25,765
Could you take a look?

465
00:37:27,786 --> 00:37:29,016
You're working hard.

466
00:37:29,016 --> 00:37:30,066
Yes.

467
00:37:34,625 --> 00:37:38,615
I gave it some thought. What do you think about...

468
00:37:38,795 --> 00:37:40,266
Yes, I know.

469
00:37:40,266 --> 00:37:43,086
That's what I put up on those hangers.

470
00:37:45,036 --> 00:37:46,715
I think it's totally different.

471
00:37:48,235 --> 00:37:49,285
Ah Jin.

472
00:37:49,636 --> 00:37:52,825
That's because you have no idea.

473
00:37:55,846 --> 00:38:00,686
I want to add fashion to munchies.

474
00:38:00,686 --> 00:38:03,606
It will be better if you have more to talk about.

475
00:38:04,056 --> 00:38:05,836
Add fashion to munchies?

476
00:38:06,255 --> 00:38:08,656
- Then the food would be the model. - Yes.

477
00:38:08,656 --> 00:38:11,945
Eating munchies will make you gain weight.

478
00:38:12,926 --> 00:38:14,146
You get fat.

479
00:38:20,906 --> 00:38:23,986
I'm serious.

480
00:38:24,806 --> 00:38:26,425
I am too.

481
00:38:27,246 --> 00:38:28,425
Ah Jin.

482
00:38:29,215 --> 00:38:30,516
How long have you been working here?

483
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:33,445
I can tell you're fairly new...

484
00:38:33,445 --> 00:38:35,936
and want to focus on the packaging.

485
00:38:36,686 --> 00:38:39,186
But you should be worrying about the content.

486
00:38:39,186 --> 00:38:41,276
This is more than enough.

487
00:38:43,996 --> 00:38:45,046
The packaging?

488
00:38:46,125 --> 00:38:49,546
Then are you in the packaging business?

489
00:38:50,195 --> 00:38:52,356
What? What did you just say?

490
00:38:52,806 --> 00:38:56,026
He's gay and will be coming out for the first time on this show.

491
00:38:56,605 --> 00:38:59,626
It wouldn't be enough to dress him in delicate and beautiful clothes.

492
00:39:00,576 --> 00:39:01,756
But this?

493
00:39:02,246 --> 00:39:04,976
It would be better to get clothes off the street market.

494
00:39:04,976 --> 00:39:08,186
Street market? Hey! Is that all you have to say?

495
00:39:08,186 --> 00:39:10,606
No, I'm not done yet.

496
00:39:11,656 --> 00:39:13,606
I'm not working with you.

497
00:39:14,255 --> 00:39:15,305
What?

498
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:18,345
I'm not working with you!

499
00:39:19,395 --> 00:39:21,476
- Wait. - Hey, hey!

500
00:39:27,366 --> 00:39:30,636
My goodness. You're fearless, Ah Jin.

501
00:39:30,636 --> 00:39:32,756
What are we going to do?

502
00:39:34,145 --> 00:39:35,495
Gosh.

503
00:39:40,746 --> 00:39:43,035
I want to help you.

504
00:39:43,355 --> 00:39:45,776
You were the nicest to me.

505
00:39:47,386 --> 00:39:50,496
However, if I work on this show,

506
00:39:50,496 --> 00:39:52,376
I'll be branded for life.

507
00:39:52,726 --> 00:39:54,695
I even got a written notice...

508
00:39:54,695 --> 00:39:57,146
to boycott you.

509
00:39:58,965 --> 00:40:00,515
This is so childish.

510
00:40:00,766 --> 00:40:03,756
Aren't they going too far? They're playing dirty.

511
00:40:05,306 --> 00:40:09,595
You probably won't find any stylists that will work with you here.

512
00:40:12,746 --> 00:40:14,616
I have to get going.

513
00:40:14,616 --> 00:40:17,166
What? Yes, of course.

514
00:40:17,485 --> 00:40:18,826
- Have a nice day. - You too.

515
00:40:18,826 --> 00:40:19,976
Thank you.

516
00:40:28,366 --> 00:40:29,546
Ms. Kim.

517
00:40:30,835 --> 00:40:32,615
Chef Park.

518
00:40:54,286 --> 00:40:55,405
It's a struggle, isn't it?

519
00:40:59,426 --> 00:41:00,776
You're lying.

520
00:41:01,195 --> 00:41:02,845
I'm really not struggling.

521
00:41:04,065 --> 00:41:06,486
It isn't right to say I'm struggling.

522
00:41:09,206 --> 00:41:12,296
I'm doing something I've always hoped for.

523
00:42:40,726 --> 00:42:44,186
By the way, what were you doing at the broadcasting station earlier?

524
00:42:45,835 --> 00:42:46,956
Oh, that's...

525
00:42:50,306 --> 00:42:51,986
I was just...

526
00:42:52,605 --> 00:42:54,756
passing by.

527
00:42:56,676 --> 00:42:59,736
Well, did you say I'd get paid...

528
00:43:01,186 --> 00:43:03,066
after the shoot?

529
00:43:05,056 --> 00:43:06,106
Yes.

530
00:43:06,786 --> 00:43:08,206
So when is the shoot?

531
00:43:09,096 --> 00:43:10,575
Well...

532
00:43:10,895 --> 00:43:13,496
As soon as the outfits are ready.

533
00:43:13,496 --> 00:43:16,235
The wardrobe department is still working on it.

534
00:43:16,235 --> 00:43:19,665
But as soon as they're ready, we can shoot. I'm sorry.

535
00:43:19,665 --> 00:43:21,306
Please wait just a little longer.

536
00:43:21,306 --> 00:43:22,385
I see.

537
00:43:26,406 --> 00:43:27,856
That jerk.

538
00:43:28,206 --> 00:43:29,296
Pardon?

539
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:30,965
I mean...

540
00:43:31,715 --> 00:43:32,836
Kang Tae Wan.

541
00:43:33,815 --> 00:43:36,066
What about designer Kang Tae Wan from "Changing You"?

542
00:43:50,899 --> 00:43:52,458
Can I ask you something?

543
00:43:53,738 --> 00:43:55,929
Why does it have to be a gay chef?

544
00:43:57,408 --> 00:43:58,508
Well...

545
00:43:58,508 --> 00:44:01,149
As it says here...

546
00:44:01,149 --> 00:44:02,828
I want to hear it from you.

547
00:44:04,678 --> 00:44:05,839
Think about it.

548
00:44:07,149 --> 00:44:10,908
Why not a five-star hotel chef?

549
00:44:11,388 --> 00:44:15,038
Why does the chef have to be gay?

550
00:44:17,428 --> 00:44:20,018
It's because I want to talk about people.

551
00:44:21,568 --> 00:44:23,238
A gay host...

552
00:44:23,238 --> 00:44:25,539
wouldn't take sides...

553
00:44:25,539 --> 00:44:27,859
between men and women.

554
00:44:28,508 --> 00:44:30,379
He could talk about people...

555
00:44:30,379 --> 00:44:33,129
from his own special perspective.

556
00:44:34,479 --> 00:44:36,529
Have you ever considered...

557
00:44:37,879 --> 00:44:41,239
if that idea could be based on prejudice?

558
00:44:42,289 --> 00:44:45,978
I don't want my clothes to be contaminated by such prejudice.

559
00:44:48,528 --> 00:44:50,109
Mr. Kang.

560
00:44:50,499 --> 00:44:51,528
Well...

561
00:44:51,528 --> 00:44:54,348
This will be your chance to attract more female customers.

562
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:58,198
Every woman dreams of having a gay friend.

563
00:44:58,198 --> 00:44:59,539
By targeting women...

564
00:44:59,539 --> 00:45:02,288
You can't become friends with someone just because you want to.

565
00:45:03,408 --> 00:45:07,199
Friendship is not a thing you buy like you buy a bag.

566
00:45:23,229 --> 00:45:25,298
I mean... I'm an idiot.

567
00:45:25,298 --> 00:45:27,928
Why did I say such a stupid thing?

568
00:45:27,928 --> 00:45:30,649
Gosh, what should I do?

569
00:45:30,999 --> 00:45:32,658
Seriously.

570
00:45:35,238 --> 00:45:37,828
Chef Park, I'm sorry.

571
00:45:37,879 --> 00:45:39,828
Gosh.

572
00:45:43,818 --> 00:45:44,969
How about...

573
00:45:47,588 --> 00:45:49,438
I talk to him?

574
00:45:49,588 --> 00:45:52,138
Pardon? You want to do that?

575
00:46:03,468 --> 00:46:04,819
We've met, right?

576
00:46:08,309 --> 00:46:10,089
I'd like to ask you to take charge of...

577
00:46:11,479 --> 00:46:12,828
the outfits for "Sweet Munchies".

578
00:46:17,379 --> 00:46:21,239
I just told Ms. Kim that I can't do it.

579
00:46:22,559 --> 00:46:24,308
You told me the other day...

580
00:46:25,019 --> 00:46:28,179
that there's a thin line between fashion and costumes.

581
00:46:30,899 --> 00:46:32,379
What's your point?

582
00:46:36,399 --> 00:46:38,049
I don't want to look ridiculous.

583
00:46:39,369 --> 00:46:40,489
That day,

584
00:46:41,568 --> 00:46:43,328
when you told me that,

585
00:46:43,939 --> 00:46:45,529
it hurt my feelings, to be honest.

586
00:46:47,079 --> 00:46:48,929
But after some thought,

587
00:46:51,249 --> 00:46:52,669
I realized that you were right.

588
00:46:56,119 --> 00:46:57,308
So...

589
00:47:00,658 --> 00:47:01,839
can you please...

590
00:47:03,698 --> 00:47:05,719
help me this once?

591
00:47:11,269 --> 00:47:12,859
You're reckless.

592
00:47:15,338 --> 00:47:16,989
If I had a choice,

593
00:47:18,579 --> 00:47:20,299
I wouldn't have come this far.

594
00:47:22,749 --> 00:47:24,399
By that, do you mean...

595
00:47:26,749 --> 00:47:28,098
Coming out?

596
00:47:30,119 --> 00:47:31,908
You don't want to look ridiculous?

597
00:47:34,289 --> 00:47:35,438
But before that,

598
00:47:37,099 --> 00:47:39,419
have you thought about how much ridicule...

599
00:47:40,599 --> 00:47:42,949
you might bring upon yourself by coming out as a gay chef on TV?

600
00:47:47,439 --> 00:47:48,618
Why?

601
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:50,728
What's so wrong about being gay?

602
00:47:54,178 --> 00:47:55,868
I don't see why...

603
00:47:56,519 --> 00:47:57,998
I should be ashamed of being gay.

604
00:47:59,619 --> 00:48:00,669
But at the same time,

605
00:48:01,988 --> 00:48:04,638
if you have a prejudice against gay people,

606
00:48:06,829 --> 00:48:08,279
I guess there's nothing I can do.

607
00:48:12,968 --> 00:48:14,219
I believe...

608
00:48:15,129 --> 00:48:16,919
no one should ever be ridiculed...

609
00:48:18,269 --> 00:48:20,688
for any reason.

610
00:48:45,729 --> 00:48:48,669
I'm so proud of you. Great job.

611
00:48:48,669 --> 00:48:51,589
From Ms. Cha to Mr. Kang...

612
00:48:52,838 --> 00:48:57,029
You saved my life.

613
00:48:58,738 --> 00:49:00,558
- Ms. Kim. - Yes?

614
00:49:00,948 --> 00:49:02,649
I have a favor to ask.

615
00:49:02,649 --> 00:49:05,399
Sure, go ahead. I can do anything for you.

616
00:49:08,249 --> 00:49:09,908
It's about my appearance fee.

617
00:49:10,888 --> 00:49:13,009
Is there a way I can get it before the shoot?

618
00:49:14,028 --> 00:49:17,708
Well, I don't think there's anything I can do about it.

619
00:49:25,298 --> 00:49:28,539
But I'll try to find a way.

620
00:49:28,539 --> 00:49:30,888
I owe you so much.

621
00:49:32,809 --> 00:49:34,598
- Really? - Yes.

622
00:49:35,379 --> 00:49:37,399
- Are you sure? - I'm positive.

623
00:49:40,919 --> 00:49:42,149
- Ms. Kim. - Yes?

624
00:49:42,149 --> 00:49:46,208
I'll work really hard.

625
00:49:46,258 --> 00:49:47,289
That sounds great.

626
00:49:47,289 --> 00:49:49,109
- Let's do this. - Let's do this.

627
00:49:49,698 --> 00:49:51,408
We can do this!

628
00:49:53,198 --> 00:49:56,188
Mr. Kang, Chef Park, I brought some snacks.

629
00:50:01,269 --> 00:50:03,788
I think I'll go get some coffee too.

630
00:50:47,088 --> 00:50:48,199
Turn around.

631
00:51:02,169 --> 00:51:04,348
Well, this makes me...

632
00:51:05,338 --> 00:51:07,188
nervous for some reason.

633
00:51:10,008 --> 00:51:11,359
You have a nice body.

634
00:51:22,149 --> 00:51:23,908
Red looks good on you.

635
00:51:25,358 --> 00:51:27,509
I'll leave everything up to you.

636
00:51:27,928 --> 00:51:30,748
I don't know much about anything other than cooking.

637
00:51:35,899 --> 00:51:36,949
What?

638
00:51:38,238 --> 00:51:40,719
I see that you can smile.

639
00:51:48,849 --> 00:51:50,419
What's your shoe size?

640
00:51:50,419 --> 00:51:51,699
265mm.

641
00:51:51,849 --> 00:51:54,098
I see. That's perfect.

642
00:51:54,588 --> 00:51:55,739
Hi, guys.

643
00:52:09,838 --> 00:52:10,989
Hello.

644
00:52:13,169 --> 00:52:14,369
- Hello. - Hello.

645
00:52:14,369 --> 00:52:15,419
Hello.

646
00:52:20,908 --> 00:52:23,799
Yu Jin, I'm counting on you.

647
00:52:28,888 --> 00:52:31,408
- Director, hello. Hello! - Hi.

648
00:52:33,229 --> 00:52:35,879
- Hello, hello. - Hey, you're here.

649
00:52:55,749 --> 00:52:56,849
Okay, we'll do that.

650
00:52:56,849 --> 00:52:59,768
Lighting Director, can we have more light over here?

651
00:53:09,629 --> 00:53:10,928
Why does he look so nervous?

652
00:53:10,928 --> 00:53:12,449
He does seem nervous.

653
00:53:12,798 --> 00:53:14,978
Right? Let's go talk to him.

654
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:18,649
Chef Park.

655
00:53:20,169 --> 00:53:22,589
Your lips look all purple. Are you all right?

656
00:53:23,838 --> 00:53:26,899
Chef Park, just follow the script.

657
00:53:28,778 --> 00:53:31,199
Right, yes. Don't worry.

658
00:53:32,048 --> 00:53:33,399
Why don't you take a deep breath?

659
00:53:33,649 --> 00:53:34,888
- Breathe in through your nose... - Sorry?

660
00:53:34,888 --> 00:53:36,808
and breathe out through your mouth. Take a deep breath.

661
00:53:37,488 --> 00:53:39,978
In through the nose and out through the mouth.

662
00:53:41,488 --> 00:53:44,158
Yes, that's it. Don't be nervous. You're okay?

663
00:53:44,158 --> 00:53:45,599
- I'm not nervous. - You're okay, right?

664
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:47,068
- I'm fine. - We'll get started, then.

665
00:53:47,068 --> 00:53:48,229
- Okay? - Yes, I'm fine.

666
00:53:48,229 --> 00:53:49,298
You're good, right?

667
00:53:49,298 --> 00:53:50,589
We'll begin now.

668
00:53:50,638 --> 00:53:51,738
Let's begin!

669
00:53:51,738 --> 00:53:52,968
- Let's start rolling. - Okay.

670
00:53:52,968 --> 00:53:54,158
We'll begin now.

671
00:53:55,769 --> 00:53:57,958
All right, we're rolling.

672
00:53:59,448 --> 00:54:00,498
Rolling.

673
00:54:02,309 --> 00:54:04,029
1, 2, 3.

674
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:08,169
Cue!

675
00:54:13,158 --> 00:54:14,208
Cue!

676
00:54:14,729 --> 00:54:15,879
Ta-da!

677
00:54:16,528 --> 00:54:17,578
What is this?

678
00:54:18,358 --> 00:54:19,499
It's our seven-year anniversary.

679
00:54:19,499 --> 00:54:22,618
We're the same age, and we've been together for seven years.

680
00:54:23,399 --> 00:54:25,288
- Even just a month ago, - This is so beautiful.

681
00:54:25,539 --> 00:54:27,989
he wanted to get married as soon as possible.

682
00:54:28,638 --> 00:54:32,828
But I found out that he's been cheating on me for two months...

683
00:54:33,249 --> 00:54:36,868
with a girl who's 10 years younger than me.

684
00:54:37,919 --> 00:54:41,299
After that day, I can't even eat tripe, my absolute favorite.

685
00:54:41,849 --> 00:54:43,609
I've just been crying every day since then.

686
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:47,239
I can't do anything.

687
00:54:48,388 --> 00:54:51,928
What can I do to break this off?

688
00:54:51,928 --> 00:54:53,078
("A Gay Chef's Sweet Munchies")

689
00:55:01,008 --> 00:55:02,089
Do you think...

690
00:55:04,039 --> 00:55:06,259
I can be in love again?

691
00:55:15,548 --> 00:55:17,339
What kind of question is that?

692
00:55:18,419 --> 00:55:20,808
It seems like you're the only one...

693
00:55:21,229 --> 00:55:23,779
who doesn't know how attractive you are.

694
00:55:41,809 --> 00:55:45,579
Gosh. Hold on. Hold on a moment.

695
00:55:45,579 --> 00:55:48,548
Chef Park, be natural.

696
00:55:48,548 --> 00:55:50,868
Just think that you're having a conversation with her.

697
00:55:51,488 --> 00:55:52,538
Okay?

698
00:55:53,088 --> 00:55:54,789
- Be natural... - Yes.

699
00:55:54,789 --> 00:55:56,009
Okay, got it.

700
00:55:56,329 --> 00:55:57,578
We'll try that again.

701
00:55:59,468 --> 00:56:01,028
We'll do it again.

702
00:56:01,028 --> 00:56:02,838
- Okay. - All right.

703
00:56:02,838 --> 00:56:04,049
Rolling.

704
00:56:11,138 --> 00:56:13,699
It seems like you're the only one...

705
00:56:14,178 --> 00:56:16,529
who doesn't know how attractive you are.

706
00:56:17,048 --> 00:56:18,828
We'll try that again.

707
00:56:25,559 --> 00:56:26,908
Don't worry.

708
00:56:29,729 --> 00:56:31,308
It seems like you're the only one...

709
00:56:32,399 --> 00:56:34,169
who doesn't know how attractive...

710
00:56:34,169 --> 00:56:35,219
Again.

711
00:56:35,798 --> 00:56:37,219
We'll try it again.

712
00:56:38,539 --> 00:56:40,259
(Park Jin Sung: Don't worry.)

713
00:56:40,838 --> 00:56:42,319
Don't worry.

714
00:56:43,278 --> 00:56:45,259
Everyone is born...

715
00:56:45,778 --> 00:56:48,399
with their soul mate's name written on...

716
00:56:49,178 --> 00:56:50,469
One more time.

717
00:56:52,379 --> 00:56:54,588
Don't... Don't worry.

718
00:56:54,588 --> 00:56:55,899
Again! One more time.

719
00:56:56,758 --> 00:56:58,169
With their soul mate's name...

720
00:56:58,718 --> 00:56:59,839
Again.

721
00:57:01,028 --> 00:57:02,879
written on the sole of their feet.

722
00:57:03,129 --> 00:57:04,279
One more time.

723
00:57:05,528 --> 00:57:06,679
You'll meet...

724
00:57:06,829 --> 00:57:07,949
Do it again.

725
00:57:09,468 --> 00:57:11,248
- You're... - Do it again.

726
00:57:11,468 --> 00:57:12,939
How attractive you are.

727
00:57:12,939 --> 00:57:14,158
We'll try that again.

728
00:57:15,709 --> 00:57:18,489
Director Kim, I have another shoot.

729
00:57:34,629 --> 00:57:35,679
I'm sorry.

730
00:57:37,028 --> 00:57:40,078
I've never done this before, so I was nervous.

731
00:57:41,369 --> 00:57:42,419
I'll...

732
00:57:43,698 --> 00:57:45,319
do better.

733
00:57:48,669 --> 00:57:49,788
Chef Park.

734
00:57:52,579 --> 00:57:53,799
Do you know why...

735
00:57:54,508 --> 00:57:56,598
I became a regular at Bistro?

736
00:57:57,448 --> 00:57:58,498
Sorry?

737
00:57:59,448 --> 00:58:00,899
"I've done more than enough."

738
00:58:02,218 --> 00:58:03,888
"I can't put up with this anymore."

739
00:58:03,888 --> 00:58:06,578
"I'm just going to quit."

740
00:58:07,959 --> 00:58:09,109
It was...

741
00:58:10,158 --> 00:58:11,679
one of those days.

742
00:58:17,198 --> 00:58:20,108
I was on my way home after working 15 hours straight,

743
00:58:20,108 --> 00:58:22,819
getting yelled at all day long and skipping all three meals.

744
00:58:24,508 --> 00:58:27,259
I suddenly noticed a sign that was still lit up.

745
00:58:27,608 --> 00:58:29,458
(Bistro, 10pm to 4am)

746
00:58:29,749 --> 00:58:32,899
I thought, "My gosh, there's a restaurant that's still open?"

747
00:58:34,019 --> 00:58:35,768
I was so glad to see that it was still open.

748
00:58:38,588 --> 00:58:40,779
So I went in and ordered soju.

749
00:58:41,658 --> 00:58:43,808
Do you know what I got as an accompaniment to the soju?

750
00:59:08,689 --> 00:59:09,839
Can you believe it?

751
00:59:10,419 --> 00:59:13,488
That I was served a home-cooked meal at a bar...

752
00:59:13,488 --> 00:59:15,138
I happened to stumble upon at 2am?

753
00:59:17,698 --> 00:59:20,819
You probably need a proper meal more than soju on a day like today.

754
00:59:51,698 --> 00:59:54,379
"Gosh, I miss Mom."

755
00:59:56,999 --> 00:59:58,489
"I want to eat..."

756
00:59:59,298 --> 01:00:01,458
"a hearty meal made by Mom."

757
01:00:08,108 --> 01:00:10,199
The food you made that day...

758
01:00:11,419 --> 01:00:14,969
reminded me of my mom's hearty home-cooked meals.

759
01:00:40,709 --> 01:00:43,669
I want to make a show like that.

760
01:00:46,548 --> 01:00:48,998
A show that can comfort the hearts of those...

761
01:00:49,858 --> 01:00:51,469
who are going through a rough patch.

762
01:00:52,358 --> 01:00:55,708
A show that's like a hearty, wholesome meal.

763
01:01:14,079 --> 01:01:16,529
Just be yourself.

764
01:01:17,019 --> 01:01:18,899
Just think that there are no cameras around.

765
01:01:19,379 --> 01:01:23,138
And think that the guest is a customer at Bistro.

766
01:01:23,858 --> 01:01:25,669
You don't have to follow the script.

767
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:54,768
Gosh.

768
01:01:56,758 --> 01:01:58,368
Ah Jin.

769
01:01:59,419 --> 01:02:02,158
What did you say to Chef Park to keep him from coming?

770
01:02:02,158 --> 01:02:04,949
Did he go home? Is he quitting?

771
01:03:01,849 --> 01:03:02,969
What's this?

772
01:03:04,858 --> 01:03:06,908
Isn't that tripe?

773
01:03:23,169 --> 01:03:24,259
Hi.

774
01:04:13,119 --> 01:04:14,739
Are you making fun of me?

775
01:04:15,189 --> 01:04:17,578
I told you tripe makes me want to throw up.

776
01:04:18,499 --> 01:04:20,118
Take this away.

777
01:04:20,798 --> 01:04:23,489
Let's try it without the tripe.

778
01:04:32,379 --> 01:04:34,458
How will you get over him...

779
01:04:35,278 --> 01:04:37,069
if you can't even eat tripe?

780
01:04:41,919 --> 01:04:43,469
You said you want to get over him.

781
01:04:56,599 --> 01:04:57,989
Try to remember.

782
01:04:59,298 --> 01:05:00,788
Not him,

783
01:05:01,638 --> 01:05:03,688
but the things you really love.

784
01:06:35,268 --> 01:06:38,469
(Sweet Munchies)

785
01:06:38,469 --> 01:06:41,009
"Sweet Munchies" forever! Cheers!

786
01:06:41,009 --> 01:06:42,308
Come on, Chef Park.

787
01:06:42,308 --> 01:06:44,709
Let's try being friends first.

788
01:06:44,709 --> 01:06:46,438
Nice to meet you, Park Jin Sung.

789
01:06:46,438 --> 01:06:47,749
Same here, Kim Ah Jin.

790
01:06:47,749 --> 01:06:50,379
Thanks to your heartfelt words,

791
01:06:50,379 --> 01:06:51,919
my clothes looked special.

792
01:06:51,919 --> 01:06:53,119
You were impressive today.

793
01:06:53,119 --> 01:06:56,419
People won't stop posting comments and the viewer ratings are high.

794
01:06:56,419 --> 01:06:58,488
"Sweet Munchies" will get a regular slot.

795
01:06:58,488 --> 01:07:00,329
Was this your plan from the start?

796
01:07:00,329 --> 01:07:02,488
You are inexperienced and can't handle it.

797
01:07:02,488 --> 01:07:04,778
Please don't do this to me.

798
01:07:05,028 --> 01:07:07,479
What does "Sweet Munchies" mean to you?

799
01:07:07,568 --> 01:07:09,019
It means everything to me.
